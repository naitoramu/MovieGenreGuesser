1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,611
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,450
Tibetan pit viper venom.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,007
Constant dose of that
can't be good for you, right?

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,123
It'll keep him sedated like it did Slade.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,164
No mention on Isabel Rochev's death?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,050
- Not a thing.
- Aah!

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,443
- Choose. Choose.
- No! No!

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,202
No, Mom.
Mom, what are you doing?

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,961
- Both my children will live.
- Mom, what are you doing?

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,481
You possess true courage.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,483
Aah! No!

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,211
There is still one person who has to die...

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,251
before this can end.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,726
No.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,044
I do solemnly swear...

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,682
that I will support, defend...

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,884
and abide by the Starling City charter.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,764
And that I will faithfully...

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,204
discharge the duties of the office
of Mayor of Starling City.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,963
That I will tirelessly pursue justice
on behalf of all Starling citizens...

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,122
impartially, to the
best of my abilities.

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,209
So help me God.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,650
Thank you.

24
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,927
Thea.

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,724
Hey.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,403
- I'm here for you.
- I know.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,004
Ms. Queen.

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,723
I wanted to offer my sincere condolences
on your loss.

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,686
Your mother was a good woman.
She would have made a wonderful mayor.

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,086
Thank you.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,810
I'd love to speak with Oliver.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,041
Well, if you see him, tell him he
missed his own mother's funeral.

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,209
No one's seen Oliver for a few days.

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,482
We all deal with grief in different ways.

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,487
And the loss of a parent is...

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,010
Well, it changes you.

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,965
When you realize that your ancestors
now look to you...

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,164
that your family's legacy,
their continuing works...

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,209
are solely in your hands...

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,366
If you see Oliver, please
tell him that I came by.

41
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,391
Of course.

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,929
Hey.

43
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,724
Thanks.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,003
I don't even know why I'm crying.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,884
I didn't even like Moira.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,290
Terrible thing to say about
someone after they just died.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,691
In my defense, she was not nice.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,810
She was diabolical.

49
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,410
Not a word you often hear
at someone's funeral.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,683
You're not crying for her, Felicity.
You're crying for Oliver.

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,969
Where is he?

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,529
How could he not be here?

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,085
I don't know.

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,161
If Oliver's smart,
he ran back to his island to hide.

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,080
But maybe he'll attend your funerals.

56
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,571
I always loved this photograph.

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,010
I thought your mother
looked particularly beautiful.

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,645
She didn't.

59
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,446
- She thought she looked bug-eyed.
- Heh.

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,929
She never said.

61
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,211
How are you holding up?

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,447
I'm not.

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,682
Your mother gave her life for you, Thea.

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,402
She showed you how much she loved you
in ways very few parents ever could.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,730
I know. She died thinking I hated her.

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,290
All we ever needed was the truth.

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,009
- It was a lie that killed her.
- I don't understand.

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,328
Slade Wilson.

69
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,369
He was on that island with Oliver.

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,246
And despises him for some reason.

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,966
There was a psychopath in our lives
and my brother never warned us about him.

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,761
Thea, your brother loves you
more than life itself.

73
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,362
You should keep that photo.

74
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,764
This sub is over 60 years old.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,362
It was carrying the Mirakuru during the war
when it ran aground.

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,570
- Blood.
- Slade's.

77
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,730
He was bleeding out. Dying.

78
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,960
Until we decided to give him the Mirakuru.

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,791
Not one of your better ideas.

80
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,986
What about my idea for
you to fix the sub?

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,003
- You were in the navy.
- The Russian navy.

82
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,487
They taught us how to sink
Japanese subs, not pilot them.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,406
Anatoli, please. I know it's a longshot,
but if we get the sub operational...

84
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,980
we can blow Slade and
the Mirakuru out of the

85
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,192
water and get the hell
off of this island.

86
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,325
Unless you have a better idea,
this is our only chance of getting home.

87
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,443
Okay, I try.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,924
No one has seen Slade Wilson
since the night of the attack.

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,017
He hasn't made any further
threats on the Queen family,

90
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:40,826
but we gotta find
this son of a...

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,565
Excuse me. Hey.

92
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,330
Missed you at the reception.

93
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,965
Yeah, I had to get back here.

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,322
- See what's happening with the case.
- Any leads?

95
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,524
Nope. Wilson's a ghost.
He's not the only one who's disappeared.

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,966
You heard from your sister?

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,970
Nothing apart from a text that
she needed a change of scenery.

98
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,971
Hm.

99
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,966
Something else on your mind?

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,889
It's Sebastian Blood.

101
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,401
There's something that doesn't seem right.

102
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,365
- Laurel...
- Dad, I know what you're thinking.

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,040
When I accused him of killing his father,
I was upset.

104
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,489
But just because I had a problem
doesn't mean I was wrong about Sebastian.

105
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,729
Please, don't go down
this road again, okay?

106
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,447
- I mean, what's bringing this on?
- I saw him at the reception.

107
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,690
And it struck me that the only reason that
he's mayor now is because Moira was killed.

108
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,207
- By Slade Wilson.
- What if there's a connection?

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,643
You once told me a cop
is only as good as his gut.

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,370
Well, I'm the daughter of a cop.

111
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,007
And I know in my gut, Sebastian
is not the man that you think he is.

112
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,043
Are you sure?

113
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,167
- Baby, last time...
- I was a drunk.

114
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,442
And you were right not to trust me.

115
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,290
But, Dad...

116
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,762
I need you to trust me now.

117
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,538
This legislation is the
first step toward making

118
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:56,629
Starling City the jewel
that it once was.

119
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,122
The jewel that it can be again.

120
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,409
Phone call for you, Mayor Blood.

121
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,607
I'm still getting used to people
calling me that, Alyssa.

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,371
- Please take a message.
- The caller insisted.

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,042
- He said he's your father.
- That's impossible.

124
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,524
Never mind. I'll take it.

125
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,609
- Hello.
- Hello, Sebastian.

126
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,245
I'm sorry to bother you.

127
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,848
I just wanted to check in
and see how your first day is going.

128
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,042
Very well, thank you.

129
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,358
But I'm a little busy right
now, so if you'll allow

130
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:34,384
me to call you back, I'll
do that as soon as I can.

131
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,887
No need. I'm sure you have
quite a lot of business to attend to.

132
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,090
You are the mayor now after all.

133
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,567
So get to work.

134
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,724
We're almost out of snake venom.

135
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,491
Seeing Roy like this reminds me of Barry.

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,087
And Barry reminds me of S.T.A.R. Labs.

137
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,020
S.T.A.R. Labs reminds me
of the Mirakuru cure that

138
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,245
they're working on which we
could really use... right now.

139
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,365
Yeah, especially since Isabel Rochev
was clearly injected with the stuff.

140
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,200
How do you know?

141
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,248
Cause there's no way she
could be walking around...

142
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,404
after being shot dead on
with a 9 mm hollow point.

143
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,967
Left about a dozen messages for Oliver
about Isabel being back. No response.

144
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,731
- You have any luck finding him?
- Tons.

145
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,530
All of it bad.

146
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,929
There's been no activity on his passport,
cell phone...

147
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,201
or bank accounts.

148
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,050
What's left of them anyhow.

149
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,165
And facial recognition hasn't spotted him
at any airport, bus or train station.

150
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,366
Right. What about Sara?

151
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,090
Nothing either.

152
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,841
Dig, people don't just go missing
like this unless...

153
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,769
Don't go there, Felicity.

154
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,689
What if she is?

155
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,530
What if Oliver is?

156
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,882
Maybe the reason we can't find him
is because...

157
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,287
He's alive, Felicity.

158
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,603
If he wasn't, Isabel Rochev
wouldn't be so shy about

159
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,509
rubbing it in our faces,
belive me, he's alive.

160
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,762
Well, I hope you have some way
on how to find him...

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,049
because I am running out
of places to look and people to ask.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,650
I know who to ask.

163
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,241
Thanks for agreeing to see us.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,287
Mr. Diggle.

165
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,727
Thought I made it clear
after our last meeting.

166
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,526
As far as A.R.G.U.S. is concerned,
you're out of favors.

167
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,007
I'm not asking for myself, Amanda.

168
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,921
I'm asking for everyone in Starling City.

169
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,248
I need you to find Oliver Queen.

170
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,564
Dig. That computer
is running an XK-15 processor.

171
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,503
Felicity.

172
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:53,754
But that's not even
supposed to exist yet.

173
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,849
- I want one.
- Let me know what you find.

174
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,400
I don't have time to keep track
of your friends, Mr. Diggle.

175
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,955
We deal with more
pressing issues here.

176
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,095
You don't understand.
Oliver's disappeared.

177
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,466
Maybe he needs some time.

178
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,366
Or is it possible that the two of you simply
haven't been looking in the right place?

179
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,763
- Did you try facial recognition?
- Yes, I ran it three times.

180
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,962
Amanda, please.

181
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,363
Slade Wilson has an army of men
just like him.

182
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,783
How many men have been
exposed to the Mirakuru?

183
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,346
Enough to lay
waste to this city.

184
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,921
- We need to find Oliver right now.
- I'll see what I can do.

185
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,969
- Have you heard from Sara?
- No.

186
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
Can you just call Mandy
and see if she can cover the bar?

187
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,971
Okay.

188
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,970
Isabel Rochev.

189
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,446
I know who you are.

190
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,283
- What can I do for you, Ms. Rochev?
- I'm sorry for your loss, Thea.

191
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,924
Is that why you came here?

192
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,691
Offer me your condolences?

193
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,044
My condolences and to give you this.

194
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,811
It's a notice to vacate the premises.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,606
This club and the steel factory
in which it's located...

196
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,723
are all assets of Queen Consolidated.

197
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,003
- No, you can't do this.
- It's already done.

198
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,366
How long do I have?

199
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,050
A couple days.

200
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,007
Councilman Tyson is asking about dinner.

201
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,329
- I already have plans tonight.
- Hi.

202
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,249
Excuse me, I didn't mean to barge in.

203
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,284
It's just that nobody
was at your front desk, so...

204
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,568
Laurel, of course please come in.
Give us a moment.

205
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,851
Twice in two days.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

206
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,965
I wish I could say that this was pleasure,
but it's about a case.

207
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,801
I'm barely moved in and people are asking
me for favors. Guess I really have arrived.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,243
- You certainly have.
- Ha, ha.

209
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,169
So tell me. How can I help you?

210
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,010
Murphy vs. Dunleavy.

211
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,886
The state charged a real estate developer
for turning away low-income tenants...

212
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,082
based on his so-called morality.

213
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,407
Have a seat.

214
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,204
So let me guess.
Our dear Fair Housing Commissioner...

215
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,767
isn't willing to testify
as your expert witness.

216
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,282
Exactly. And your predecessor
wasn't willing to lean on him.

217
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,802
Well, lucky for you, I'm
not my predecessor.

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,216
You know, this actually
reminds me of one I

219
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:19,507
had during my days as a
community organizer.

220
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,011
I was hoping that it would.

221
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,487
I've seen dozens of cases
like this at CNRI.

222
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,246
Well, it's a good thing we both remember
where we came from. I'm happy to help.

223
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,965
Thank you.

224
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,689
Laurel.

225
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,451
I'm really glad you got your job back
at the DA's office.

226
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,806
I look forward to us working together
for a long time.

227
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,724
As do I.

228
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,992
Is it working?

229
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:53,472
Using the bug to remote
access the computer right now.

230
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,247
Yeah, you listen, if you ever
get tired of practicing law,

231
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:57,512
you'd make a pretty decent spy.

232
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,809
- You guys have a warrant for this, right?
- Just...

233
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,848
Terrific. Could you at least tell me
whose computer you bugged?

234
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,650
- You're kidding. I voted for him.
- Yeah.

235
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,811
I need to know if there's anything
incriminating in Blood's files.

236
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,520
What the hell?
This was a dead-end job anyway.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,890
This all looks pretty benign.
Lots of policy papers.

238
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,721
All documents transferred
from his campaign office.

239
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,769
Drafts, press releases.

240
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,883
Wait, wait, wait. Click back.

241
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,607
"For immediate release. My thoughts
and prayers are with the Queen family...

242
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,451
in the aftermath
of this unspeakable tragedy."

243
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,840
So he worked up a press release
after Moira was killed.

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,331
No, he didn't.

245
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,767
He wrote that the day before Moira died.

246
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,089
She's right. Look at the time stamp.

247
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,404
- Oh, my God.
- Sebastian knew Slade was gonna kill her.

248
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,369
Is that the Satellite Frequency
Communicator TX-50?

249
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,864
Can I touch it? I know
that sounds a little weird

250
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,192
and creepy, but I've never
seen one in real life.

251
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,601
It's classified equipment, Ms. Smoak.

252
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,924
You must feel very powerful.

253
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,924
Knowing everything about everyone.

254
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,851
Not powerful in an evil
dictator, Stalin way.

255
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,408
More of a "knowledge is power" way.

256
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,166
- Ma'am, we have something.
- Ahem.

257
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,648
I should have known.

258
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,565
- What?
- Oliver's at the lair...

259
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,922
from which he conducts his operations.

260
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,485
But we were just there.

261
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,762
Not that lair.

262
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,041
His other one.

263
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,324
Like riding bicycle.

264
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,763
Underwater.

265
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,569
What's that sound?

266
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,967
We're stuck.

267
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,923
- Like Japanese were.
- Submarines have torpedoes, right?

268
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,963
Can we blast our way out?

269
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,801
I can see why you two are made for
each other. You like your explosions.

270
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,882
Yes, torpedoes.

271
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,208
- What?
- These are Kaiten torpedoes.

272
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,084
Manually operated.

273
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,760
Someone needs to steer from inside.

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,890
Okay, but then how do they get away
from the explosion?

275
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,241
They do not.

276
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,284
How did you find me?

277
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,561
Waller.

278
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,889
- We were worried about you.
- After you missed your mother's funeral.

279
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,088
I'm sorry that I didn't go.

280
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,486
I left for the cemetery.

281
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,485
But I ended up here.

282
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,446
- And here is...?
- Here was a secondary facility...

283
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,610
in case the foundry was compromised.

284
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,287
But it became somewhere
that I could just go and...

285
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,003
be alone.

286
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,131
She's dead because of me.

287
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,921
Five years ago...

288
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,730
I could've cured Slade.

289
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,003
And that would've prevented all of this.

290
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,651
And now...

291
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,008
all the people left that I care about...

292
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,646
we're all in his crosshairs.

293
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,410
That ends tonight.

294
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,164
How?

295
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,804
I turn myself over to Slade.

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,606
I end this vendetta.

297
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,802
Oliver, you think this ends...

298
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,810
with you turning yourself over to Slade?

299
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,729
Yes, I do.

300
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,886
After she was gone...

301
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,321
he told me that one more person
had to die.

302
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,562
And then it would end.

303
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,160
This ends for Slade when he kills me.

304
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,089
I don't accept that.

305
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,251
You shouldn't either.
You can't just accept things, Oliver.

306
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,766
If I'd accepted my life, I would be a
cocktail waitress in Vegas like my mother.

307
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,262
And I never would
have gone to college.

308
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,955
And I never would have moved away a thousand
miles to work at Queen Consolidated.

309
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,805
And I never would have believed
some crazy guy in a hood...

310
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,731
when he told me that I could be more
than just some IT girl.

311
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,125
Please don't do this.

312
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,044
Felicity.

313
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,491
Someone once told me...

314
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,447
that the essence of heroism
is to die so others can live.

315
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,610
- It's not that simple, Oliver.
- Yes, it is.

316
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,484
Slade's whole plan...

317
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,449
was to take everything from me.

318
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,043
He did.

319
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,209
He wins.

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,162
All that's left is for me to die.

321
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,966
There has to be another way.

322
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,007
There isn't.

323
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,126
Thea, please. I understand you're upset.

324
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,163
This is an emotional time for all of us.

325
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,330
I'm not being emotional. I'm...

326
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,362
I'm an orphan.
I'm a jobless and homeless orphan.

327
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,450
- There's nothing left for me here.
- I'm here.

328
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,881
I thank you for that,
but honestly I need to start over.

329
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,050
Oliver.

330
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,849
We missed you at the funeral.

331
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,610
And the reception.

332
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,567
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there.

333
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,126
What's going on here?

334
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,291
- Thea's thinking of leaving Starling City.
- No, I am leaving.

335
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,961
Walter, can I speak to my sister
for a moment?

336
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,485
Perhaps you'll have better luck.

337
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,244
Ollie, please, just don't even try
to convince me to stay.

338
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,727
I won't. I think it's a good idea.

339
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,170
You should get as far from Starling City
as you possibly can.

340
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,969
In our family, out of you, me, Mom and Dad,
you are the best of us.

341
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,770
You have the purest heart.

342
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,764
And I can't ever have you lose that.

343
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,651
Okay? You promise me?

344
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,647
Okay.

345
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,205
And I know that I haven't always
been the best brother.

346
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,962
Or friend,
or whatever you've needed me to be.

347
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,960
But there has not been a day
since you were born...

348
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,322
where I didn't cherish having you
as a sister.

349
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,251
I'll get in touch
when I get settled somewhere.

350
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,242
It's Oliver.

351
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,162
This ends now.

352
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,331
I'll be at the pier. I'll be alone.

353
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,525
I'll do it.

354
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,129
Peter, you'll die.

355
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,728
I'm already dead.

356
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,809
Radiation poisoning.

357
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,527
Ivo's little gift.

358
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,731
Said he needed to find out
if Mirakuru could cure cancer.

359
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,160
Guess we'll never find out.

360
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,362
I'm sorry, Peter. I didn't know.

361
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,844
Ivo said the essence of heroism
is to die so that others can live.

362
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,765
I held onto that.
It's the only thing that gave me hope.

363
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,921
So I'll go.

364
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,681
It may not be saving millions of lives,
but I'll be saving yours.

365
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,007
This is where it all started.

366
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,244
Got on the Queen's Gambit right over there.

367
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,680
Should have died on that boat.

368
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,084
If I had, none of this would have happened.

369
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,521
I never would have met you.

370
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,129
Shado and my mother would still be alive.

371
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,923
No one else is gonna die because of me.

372
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,010
Diggle, what the hell?

373
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,682
Slade Wilson...

374
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,249
he told me who you were.

375
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,926
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

376
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,691
He was trying to hurt you.
And when you went missing...

377
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,962
I reached out...

378
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,162
to your partners.

379
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,528
They told me what you were
planning on doing.

380
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,801
It's what I have to do.

381
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,848
Will you give us a moment?

382
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,525
You thought about telling me...

383
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,961
the night of the Undertaking.

384
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,850
Thought about telling you
almost every night.

385
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,284
Why didn't you?

386
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,204
Tommy knew...

387
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,290
didn't he?

388
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,849
You were with him.

389
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,085
You were with him at the end.

390
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,362
His last words were about you.

391
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,847
He wanted to know if you were safe.

392
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,687
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.

393
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,649
And my mother.

394
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,608
But I can save you.

395
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,250
And Thea.

396
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,804
- I can save the city if this ends tonight.
- No.

397
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,561
No, you can't commit suicide, Ollie.

398
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,728
You won't do that to me.

399
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,651
Or to Sara, or to your friends,
or to Thea.

400
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,683
Oliver...

401
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,207
she just lost her mother.

402
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,368
Losing you would destroy her.

403
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,921
She'll be alive.

404
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,564
I don't know anything about
hoods and masks...

405
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,168
or human weapons or any of this...

406
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,089
but I know you.

407
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,123
I know you like I know my own name.

408
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,369
And I realize it may sound crazy
in light of your secret...

409
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,729
but I know who you are
in your bones, Oliver.

410
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,845
And that person,
that person doesn't give up.

411
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,601
That person, he always finds a way.

412
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,765
- Not this time.
- You're wrong.

413
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,524
You wanna protect the people
who you love?

414
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,451
Then the only way to do that
is to stop Slade Wilson...

415
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,324
- Laurel, I can't.
- Yes, you can...

416
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,366
by stopping Sebastian Blood, because
Sebastian is working with Slade Wilson.

417
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,643
I have proof.

418
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,084
Slade Wilson killed your mother
so that Sebastian could become mayor.

419
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,646
You were right about him.

420
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,087
The man in the skull mask
works for Slade Wilson.

421
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,531
And this entire time...

422
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,402
it was Sebastian?

423
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,807
What's happening
is bigger than you and Slade.

424
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,406
This city needs the Arrow.

425
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,606
What's this for?

426
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,160
I don't want you to be in here.

427
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,084
- No, I'm gonna stay with you.
- Sara...

428
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,006
if this doesn't work,
I need you to be safe.

429
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,522
We will come for you when it's over.

430
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,245
Okay.

431
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,210
Do you know how the torpedo works?

432
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,124
I get in, he fires, I steer, you pray.

433
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,130
- Peter, what you're doing is...
- Practical.

434
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,244
- My time's already up.
- Brave.

435
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,447
You need to know that.

436
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,435
I don't think I could
do something like this.

437
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,110
You have.

438
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,530
What you did for us, coming back
to that boat, setting us free...

439
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,200
I came back to the boat
because I want to go home.

440
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,324
I wasn't thinking about
saving anybody.

441
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,090
It's not who I am.

442
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,569
Maybe not yet.

443
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,246
Launch?

444
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,642
- Is Sara clear?
- Yes.

445
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,205
Yes.

446
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,608
Hello, good to see you.

447
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,729
Clinton, you can wait in the car.

448
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,402
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Nothing's going to happen to me here.

449
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,644
- How are you doing Mr. Mayor?
- Hi.

450
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,683
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

451
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,564
Hey, thank you.

452
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,850
- Hi.
- Good to see you, sir.

453
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,849
Congratulations.

454
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,724
Nice to see you.

455
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,288
Sebastian, may I join you for dinner?

456
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,049
Hey, can you hold that?

457
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,881
Oh, thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate it.

458
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,051
Clinton Hogue...

459
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,129
I have some questions for you.

460
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,641
- Go to hell.
- You sure that's how you wanna play it?

461
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,200
You think I've never
taken a beating before?

462
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,240
Pal, you're gonna wish I beat you.

463
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,684
Hi, I'll be your interrogator.

464
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,650
- Is this a joke?
- Clinton Hogue.

465
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,571
Social Security Number 306-00-3894?

466
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,444
What the hell's this supposed to be?

467
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,324
Well, look at this.

468
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,444
You have a bank account
in the Cayman Islands.

469
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,525
Wow.

470
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,047
Two million dollars,
quite the little nest egg.

471
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,538
But looks like you just
approved a wire transfer

472
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:16,866
of $1 million to a charity
here in Starling City.

473
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,849
Very generous.

474
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,964
- And what should I do with the rest?
- Greenpeace.

475
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,969
Great cause.

476
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,170
And they really appreciate the support.

477
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,968
- Bitch.
- Bitch with Wi-Fi.

478
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,447
Hey Clint, looks like your mom and dad have
a really nice retirement portfolio too.

479
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,929
But they, oh, no, are just about to make
some really bad investments.

480
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,204
Okay, wait, just wait. Just stop.

481
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,090
What do you wanna know?

482
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,480
I missed you at your mother's
memorial service.

483
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,371
I wanted to offer my condolences.

484
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,929
You're the mayor.

485
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,327
Congratulations.

486
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,250
You've always wanted that.

487
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,803
Believe me, Oliver,
I wish it had happened a different way.

488
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,526
Your mother and I,
we didn't agree on much...

489
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,326
but we both wanted
what was best for Starling City.

490
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,402
I will help this city find its heart again,
I promise you that.

491
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,371
Do you really think that he...

492
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,722
will let that happen?

493
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,286
Slade Wilson.

494
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,404
How do you know I've been
working with Slade Wilson?

495
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,249
Because I'm the Arrow.

496
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,728
Of course. Heh.

497
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,127
It all makes sense now.

498
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,486
It was right in front of me.

499
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,841
You came to my office
and you shook my hand.

500
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,248
You said that together
we can save this city.

501
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,911
You think that there will
be a city to be saved...

502
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,283
after you unleash Slade's Mirakuru army?

503
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,646
They'll only cause enough damage
to make this city ready.

504
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,685
Ready for your leadership?

505
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,322
For my vision of what this city could be.

506
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,927
A better city.

507
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,566
And after the storm they're about to
suffer, the people of Starling...

508
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,003
will support and follow me to that city.

509
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,290
Whatever Slade promised you,
he will not deliver.

510
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,921
He wants to hurt me.

511
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,321
You are a pawn in a much larger game.

512
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,811
Slade promised me City Hall...

513
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,650
and he delivered.

514
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,444
He makes good on his promises.

515
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,331
I understand he made you a promise too.

516
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,129
What are you gonna do?

517
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,644
You gonna stab the mayor
in a restaurant full of people?

518
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,607
It's a new day in Starling City, Oliver.

519
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
And there's nothing you can do to stop it.

520
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,360
Slade's men are taking the city tonight?

521
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,567
They can try.

522
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,720
He has more men than we thought,
all on Mirakuru.

523
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,320
- It could be a massacre.
- Not if we get to them first.

524
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,682
We stick to the plan, no matter what.

525
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,723
Slade's using the sewer system.

526
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,400
You can drop in at Rock Avenue,
then head southeast.

527
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,022
The lines converge
at Water Street.

528
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:33,487
If Slade's army's underground,
that's probably where he'll be.

529
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,927
Good. Let's go.
Diggle, you ready?

530
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,768
- Never not.
- I'm coming too.

531
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,327
No, you're not.

532
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,960
Felicity can give me a radio.
I'll just be your eyes and ears.

533
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,680
I'll stay out of your way, I promise.
Nothing will happen to me.

534
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,689
What if it did?

535
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,850
Slade's men, one-on-one,
they are nearly impossible to stop.

536
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,447
I need you to trust me...

537
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,688
and I need you to be safe.

538
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,444
But not them?

539
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,371
This started with the three of us.

540
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,646
It's time we got back to that.

541
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,486
Tonight we rise up as one
and take back this city.

542
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,160
I have eyes on Blood's army.

543
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,186
Got it. I'm forwarding
Dig your ping along with

544
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:17,195
the foundation schematics
of the Topside Avenue.

545
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,706
Follow the route I laid
out in the blueprints,

546
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:22,026
you'll see structural
joints in the concrete.

547
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,241
Blow them all, Blood gets buried.

548
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,205
Got it.

549
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,721
The market opened today up 400 points...

550
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,208
thanks in part to the surprise rally
of Queen Consolidated.

551
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,521
New leadership...

552
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,203
has investors excited about the company's
future in spite of its recent tragedies.

553
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,760
- Excuse me, why can't I board my train?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

554
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,367
This is business class right now.
Coach will be boarding soon.

555
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,483
Okay.

556
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,205
Come on, pal.

557
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,601
Isn't that one of the
Iron Heights escapees?

558
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,810
Dumbass here tried to rob a convenience
store, gave up soon as I pulled in.

559
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,033
Mind if I just stick
him here for a minute?

560
00:38:08,058 --> 00:38:09,073
No, no, go ahead.

561
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,840
I'm just asking here.

562
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,089
Oliver, you've worked really hard
not to kill anymore.

563
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,729
Dropping an entire block on these guys
is murder. Manslaughter at least.

564
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,446
They're not men.

565
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,846
Not anymore.

566
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,651
Have Diggle blow the charges
the moment he's ready.

567
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,524
Oliver?

568
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,925
We will lead this city
out of the darkness...

569
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,201
and each one of you will help me.

570
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,446
Come on.

571
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,242
Oliver, where the hell are you?

572
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,969
You killed me.

573
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,323
Let me return the favor.

574
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,449
Hey, you got the time?

575
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,491
- It's, uh, 9:00.
- Thanks.

576
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,090
Oliver, please.

577
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,923
Cisco, now is really not a good time.

578
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,325
There.

579
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,284
Ollie...

580
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,051
there's too many of them.

581
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,969
We can't fight.

582
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,690
We're not going to.

583
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,367
Turn the wheel.

584
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,250
- What direction?
- It doesn't matter. Just turn the wheel.

585
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,571
- I can't.
- That is not an option.

586
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,843
- I got it!
- My God, we're moving.

587
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,764
Good, good. Good.

588
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,924
Sara, we did it.

589
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,211
- Sara.
- Oliver!
