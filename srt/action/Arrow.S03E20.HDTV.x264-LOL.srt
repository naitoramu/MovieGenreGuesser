stops being awful.

What did Felicity
say to Dr. Vaca?

She thinks Thea's
being moved to Central City.

171
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,061
You know, they do amazing
things at S.T.A.R. Labs.

172
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,263
We might think about
paying them a visit

173
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:26,165
before putting Thea
on a long flight to Nanda Parbat.

174
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,134
S.T.A.R. Labs
can't save her.

175

Look, I know
what I have done

178
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,543
doesn't seem like the actions
of a loving father,

179
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,479
but I do love her.

180
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,948
She's the only child
I have left.

181
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,274
Having said that,

182
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,409
I would rather
lose her forever

183

her to the pit.

Yeah.

Thanks for letting me
be here for you.

You're welcome.

I didn't have much of a choice,
though, did I?

190
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,482
No.

191
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:27,783
I wanted to make you think

192
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,852
you had grown
a little as a person.

193
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:37,193
I know that I've only
told you a little

194
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,962
about the five years
that I was away.

195
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:43,165
Well, if by "little,"
you mean hardly anything.

196
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,035
I came back
to Starling City

197
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:50,339
before they found me
on the island.

I saw Thea.

201
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,784
She didn't see me.

202
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:06,222
She had a drug problem.

203
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:11,961
So I..confronted
her dealer.

204

And I broke his neck.

205
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:17,700
And I did it because
I was angry, sure.

206
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:22,004
But I also did it because I felt like
I was protecting her.

All I've ever wanted to do
was protect her.

And one night,
a man came to my door

a horrible choice--

323
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,492
to leave without saying
a word to them,

324

or to stand and watch them
tortured and then killed.

325
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:15,166
And I left
without a farewell.

And to spare them pain,

327

worse than death.

Sounds like you gave up
too easily.

329
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:28,646
If there's one immutable
truth about life...

330
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,616
It's often more cruel
than it is fair,

331
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,851
and rarely provides
an opportunity for any of us

332
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,520
to find closure.

333
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,091
And all
your posturing

334
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,627
and all
your threats of war

335
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:45,530
will merely delay
the inevitable,

336
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,831
causing you
to forfeit

337
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,335
the opportunity
you have.

338
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:53,137
This was denied me.

339
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,642
You need to tell
Oliver good-bye.

340
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,946
Tell him how much
you love him.

341
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:06,784
Tell him whatever it is your heart
needs to express.

342
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:10,254
And do it now.

343
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,626
Before he is lost
to you forever.

344
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,045
[Knock on door]
Yeah?

345
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:35,838
Hi.

346
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,840
Hey.

347
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,317
You ok?

348
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:41,452
I'm sorry, that's
a stupid question. You...

349
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,888
You just saw your sister
come back from being mostly dead

350
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,491
and you are about to give up
everything you know and love,

351
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,860
so you're probably not.

352
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,062
I remember the first
time that I thought

353
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:53,498
I'd never
see Thea again.

354
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,034
When my father's
boat went down.

355
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:58,903
But you did see her again.

356
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,906
And you'll see her again...

357
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,609
Again.

358
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,678
This is different.

359
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,212
I've just been
thinking about

360
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,882
the...person I was.

361
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:13,017
The brother
that I was.

362
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,955
And how he probably
died when that boat went down.

363
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,060
All this time, I've been struggling
with who I am...

364
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:25,096
And you think who you're
supposed to be is...

365
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,934
The next
Ra's al Ghul?

366
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,403
Honestly?

367
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:35,206
I don't know.

368
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,876
The only thing that
I can know for sure

369
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,378
is that everything
that I've done;

370
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,080
every--everything
that happened,

371
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,915
it led me right here,

372
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,784
to this moment.

373
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:50,088
And Felicity,
if that's true,

374
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,057
then...I don't know
what it was all for.

375
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,860
I do.

376
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:03,768
I wish that I could change
your mind about staying here,

377
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,704
but I know I can't.

378
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:11,542
Just like I know how leaving you
here is going to destroy me.

379
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,479
I don't regret
a single moment.

380
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,483
And you shouldn't,
either.

381
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,551
You have done so much.

382
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:24,222
You have saved so
many people's lives.

383
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,291
And you have changed so many
for the better.

384
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,229
Including mine.

385
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,531
Knowing you has
changed my life.

386
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,734
You...opened up my heart

387
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:41,272
in a way I didn't even
know was possible.

388
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,743
I love you.

389
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,401
We searched the whole truck.
There's nothing in there.

390
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,878
Where is the bio weapon?

Where is the food cart?

396
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,963
We should split up
to cover more ground.

397
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,500
What's wrong?

398
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,402
I know you don't
think we should be doing this.

399
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,337
You decided we should
set an example for our son.

400
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,539
And for ourselves.

401
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,807
We can't just
let people die.

402
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,543
If we do, we are
just a shell.

going to completely lose your mind?

If we get caught,
he'll kill all of us.

Then we can't get caught.

that the scary fortress

I am afraid I will never forgive myself
for leaving you here.

You told me once that...

life is precious.

from it than I could offer you.

The only way that
I'm going to survive this...

That is--that is what
I'm trying to explain.

To save you, Oliver
had to join the League.
