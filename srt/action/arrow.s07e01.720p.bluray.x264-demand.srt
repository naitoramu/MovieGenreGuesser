1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,438
<i>Last season on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,352
This is my city!

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,669
You want to stop me,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,114
you're gonna have to
kill me!

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,350
No!

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,316
So far Ricardo Diaz
has been unstoppable.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,199
You want my help? I'm gonna
need two things from you.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,320
- Mr. Queen, it's time.
- What is she talking about?

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,656
I thought you said
we had immunity!

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,752
You do, but only
if Oliver agreed to turn himself in.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,309
<i>There is still work
to be done.</i>

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,560
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,280
- William, run!
- I can't run anymore.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,158
Yes, you can!
Get up. Get up.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,160
Oliver, help!

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,799
Oliver can't help you.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,031
Run now! Now!

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,273
You're brave.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,113
Oliver Queen took
everything from me.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,117
I'm gonna enjoy taking
everything from him.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,510
Morning, 4587.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,670

Morning, 4587.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,240
Beautiful day.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,753
You... you're
the Green Arrow.

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,070
Wrong guy.

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,514
But I saw you on TV.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,816
That beard threw me off
a little bit,

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,035
but... It's
definitely you.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,077
I'm a big fan.

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,560
"You have failed
this city."

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,474
OK, I'm not that person
anymore, all right?

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,680
Look, I'll join whatever
gang you're in.

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,160
I don't care what
I have to do.

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,038
I just... I need your
protection.

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm not in a gang.

62
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,878
Then let me be your,
uh, sidekick

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,957
or your lookout or
something. Please.

64
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,191
Just... I...

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,078
How am I supposed
to survive in here?

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,359
I don't know.
Leave me alone.

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,040
What the hell?

68
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,310
I told you this
wasn't over, didn't I?

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,113
We waited a long time
for this.

70
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,151
Revenge is a bitch.

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,754
We don't have
to do this.

72
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,274
But we want to.

73
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,756
Break it up!
Break it up!

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,960
You've all had enough fun
for today, don't you think?

75
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,077
You know the penalty
for being in possession

76
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,833
of a weapon, Mr. Turner.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,070
Take him to the hole.

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,560
You're dead.

79
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,359
When I get out,
you're a dead man!

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,035
He planted that.
That's not mine.

81
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,792
Deals can't miss, bro.

82
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,872
Primo product, great price.

83
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,475
Look, I'm on my way
over now, OK?

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,392
It can't be you. Aah!

85
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,676
Would you mind
handling the incident report?

86
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,195
I'd like to make date night
with Curtis for a change.

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,279
Go get the captain.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,837
4587, you pull that crap
again from yesterday,

89
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,037
I'm gonna make
an example out of you.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,351
Understood, inmate?

91
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,760
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,432
You got a visitor.

93
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,153
You know the drill.

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,360
You've looked better.

95
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,840
I've looked worse.

96
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,638
How are William
and Felicity?

97
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,677
Still safe and sound
in witness protection.

98
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,319
I've upped surveillance
to 24/7

99
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,754
since we spoke last week.

100
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,153
Has the FBI made
any progress?

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,119
No. No. Nothing.

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
Watson says she won't
stop looking,

103
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,790
and neither will I.

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,872
But, Oliver, it's been
5 months, man.

105
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,270
Five months.

106
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,936
Maybe we need to think
about the possibility

107
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,952
that Diaz is
off the grid for good.

108
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,633
I can't believe that.

109
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,440
I know this
must be so frustrating...

110
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,557
losing all sense
of agency like this.

111
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,994
Being out of control,
I know,

112
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,356
is not your strong suit.

113
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,592
I'm focusing on what
I can control.

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,149
What's that?

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,353
Keep my head down.

116
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,917
Hopefully shorten
my sentence.

117
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,835
That's smart.

118
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,752
I think that's a good play.

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,155
But I worry about the toll

120
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,879
that's going to take
on you, Oliver.

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,360
Cuts heal, John.

122
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,079
Not physically, bro.

123
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,310
Keeping passive,
not fighting back.

124
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,994
Never been who you were.

125
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,757
I've always done
what I had to do.

126
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,357
Right now...

127
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,152
This is what
I have to do.

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,317
Don't lose yourself
in here, Oliver.

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,675
I'll be OK.

130
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Damn it.

131
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,595
What's up?

132
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,400
We're supposed to go
live on this app today,

133
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,999
but something in the upgrade

134
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,833
is corrupting
the break. It's...

135
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,474
can I take a look?

136
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,233
Be my guest.

137
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,435
Oh, yeah.

138
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,354
Are you some sort of, like,
secret tech wiz or something?

139
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,035
I just know my way
around a computer.

140
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,474
There you go.

141
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,189
You are a woman of many
talents, Erin. It's...

142
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,875
saving the world one
Espresso at a time.

143
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,993
This coffee's crap.

144
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,879
I'll make sure to take
it up with our barista.

145
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,394
You ready to talk?

146
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,914
To a beat cop?

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,992
I've already wasted
enough of my time.

148
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,639
I want to talk
to your captain.

149
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,357
You sure about that?

150
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,072
Because officer anastas
is a lot more patient

151
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
than I am.

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,994
Lady captain? Oh, nice.

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,675
Hmm. Well, you have

154
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,229
quite the list of allegations
against you, huh?

155
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,994
Fraud, racketeering,
embezzlement.

156
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,151
The key word being
allegations.

157
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,836
Well, where there's smoke,
there's fire, Mr. Stent.

158
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,673
And in my experience,
innocent men

159
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,116
don't typically show up bound
and gagged at my doorstep

160
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
without reason.

161
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,999
There's a reason,
all right.

162
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
The Green Arrow.

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,296
Maybe you hit your head
a little too hard,

164
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,039
but Oliver Queen is
in prison.

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,157
Then there's another
psycho in green leather

166
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,351
assaulting people
with a bow and Arrow.

167
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,433
There have been no vigilantes
in this city for 5 months.

168
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,536
Looks like you got your work
cut out for you, then, don't you?

169
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,597
Now, are you gonna
let me go,

170
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,433
or do I have to sue
your asses?

171
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,035
Yeah. Just as soon

172
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,952
as officer anastas
takes your statement...

173
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,714
Very slowly.

174
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,158
Guys, guys, remember,
always keep your hands high.

175
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,833
That's your guard.

176
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,559
Tony, yeah. In and out.

177
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,960
Yeah, but keep your distance.

178
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,918
Nice one, peanut.

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,480
Isn't it bad
to punch things?

180
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,438
Ms. Lopez says
Gandhi wasn't violent.

181
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,920
Gandhi ain't
from The Glades.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Besides, self-defense isn't
about being violent.

183
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,636
It's about being focused
and disciplined

184
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,360
so you can protect yourself
and the ones that you love.

185
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,240
That's just 'cause there's no more
heroes to keep us safe, right?

186
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,757
Hey, dad, my bag's leaking.

187
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,633
Uh, nothing a little
duct tape can't fix.

188
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,274
Are we ever gonna
get new stuff?

189
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,840
This bag's
kind of gross.

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,798
Still waiting to hit
that lottery, Zoe.

191
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,952
Besides,
gross builds character.

192
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,794
Ten-minute break while I
patch these things up.

193
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,190
What's up with you, man?

194
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,033
This class is dumb.

195
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,416
Boxing's not gonna win you
a fight in The Glades,

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
and you know it.

197
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,760
Boxing's not about winning.

198
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,797
It's about being focused
and disciplined

199
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,075
so you don't have to fight.

200
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,998
You mean with, like,
a hockey mask?

201
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,355
Come on, man.

202
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,776
Everyone here knows
that you're Wild Dog

203
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,916
after that trial.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,280
And you just didn't
punch people.

205
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,919
I don't do that anymore.

206
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,430
Yeah? Maybe you should.

207
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,751
'Cause my family just
got robbed last week.

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,917
And the cops don't care
about us in The Glades.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,560
So it's on us
to protect ourselves.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,071
Hitting these bags
isn't gonna do it.

211
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,991
You know, I ain't into
blondes myself.

212
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,276
Put that down.

213
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,232
Slow your roll,
Arrow.

214
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
You wouldn't want
this conversation to get messy.

215
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,991
You know I can just take
that from you, right?

216
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,799
Well, that'd be
a good thing.

217
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,176
You see, it'd save us
the trouble of planting it

218
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,759
when we rat you out
to Yorke,

219
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,832
just like you did to Turner.

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,559
Now, I know you're
trying to get back

221
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,711
to this pretty little face.

222
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,399
You're probably counting
down the days.

223
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,392
Just tell me what you want.

224
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,278
Yeah. Well, you see...

225
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,511
you see,
me and Sampson here,

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,638
we've got a 3-man
operation with Turner.

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,393
Side hustle.

228
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,791
And, uh, because of you,
we're a man down.

229
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,916
So I think you
should take his place.

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,229
No chance.

231
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,550
Now, here's two reasons
why I don't believe you.

232
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,279
Now, I bet you
really wish you

233
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,716
hadn't have stopped Merlyn
from killing me, don't you?

234
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,517
See you soon, Arrow.

235
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,679
Sure, I can sell cheap
to the culebras, no problem.

236
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,314
Whatever you want,
Mr. Stent.

237
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,189
Heh. You got it. I got you.

238
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,192
My man.

239
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,437
This ain't no playground, kid.
Keep it moving.

240
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,074
Y'all sell guns, right?

241
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,320
That depends.

242
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,776
How much money you got,
little man?

243
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,439
He's not interested.

244
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,830
You followed me?

245
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,832
Yeah, I figured you would do
something stupid,

246
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,639
and it looks like
I was right.

247
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,032
Hold on.

248
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,239
I know you.

249
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,136
You're the one that dropped
a dime on Oliver Queen.

250
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,153
Uh, crazy dog
or something like that.

251
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,514
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let's go. Come on.

252
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,640
Unfortunately for you,

253
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,155
you just saw my whole operation.

254
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,672
And that can't be good
for anybody.

255
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,399
Get down.

256
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
You OK?

257
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,952
Was that the Green Arrow?

258
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,398
I don't know who
the hell that is.

259
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,190
We should turn around!
It's not safe.

260
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,993
But is it impossible?

261
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,152
No, not impossible,
but it's not very smart.

262
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,754
Then how about I add
another 100 grand

263
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,559
to the 200,000
I've already paid you?

264
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,711
Most people would pay
that kind of money

265
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,678
to stay away from here.

266
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,276
This place must be very
important for you.

267
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,999
It's not the place.

268
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,631
It's the person I'm
hoping to find there.

269
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,631
- Hey.
- Hey.

270
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,996
Thanks for your help
the other day.

271
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,480
Yeah, it was nothing.

272
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,835
Ah, it was more
than nothing.

273
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,310
The app's number one
thanks to your genius.

274
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,074
Oh, well, I'm pretty
sure I just touched

275
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,913
somebody's snotty
snot rag,

276
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,271
so I am also living
the dream.

277
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,096
Ha ha. Well, I hope I'm
not one of those customers

278
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,634
that you secretly
complain about.

279
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,952
You? No. You're
polite and nice.

280
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,280
And your hygiene is fairly
on point from what I can tell.

281
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,390
The bar seems pretty low.

282
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,656
Yeah. You should work here a month,
you might change your mind.

283
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,515
You could always... I don't know...
change my mind over dinner?

284
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,912
Unless if that just put me
on your creepy customer list.

285
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,070
You're asking me out.

286
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,200
And now I'm regretting it.

287
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,072
No. I mean, I'm
flattered and everything,

288
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,198
because, like,
"whoa. Still got it!"

289
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,878
Not interested? I... I get it.

290
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,078
No, you definitely
don't get it.

291
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,496
<i>Breaking News
out of Star City this morning</i>

292
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,751
<i>as the D.A.'s office

295

296
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,000
<i>we go live to city hall.</i>

297
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,896
- Are the rumors true?
- Is the Green Arrow really back?

298
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,149
Did Oliver Queen
escape?

299
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,471
Do you have any idea
who's under that mask?

300
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,438
We have reason to believe

301
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,070
that a vigilante impersonating
the Green Arrow is out there.

302
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,391
While we're still pursuing leads
as to the identity

303
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,117
of this unknown assailant, we
can tell you with 100% certainty

304
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,271
that he is not Oliver Queen.

305
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,834
This is someone new.

306
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
You said, "assailant."

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,936
Does that mean city hall
considers this new Green Arrow

308
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
a threat?

309
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,032
To the rule of law? Absolutely.

310
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,631
Star City continues to employ
a zero-tolerance policy

311
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,599
against any and all acts of
vigilantism.

312
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,154
Anyone found committing or
aiding and abetting these acts

313
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,359
will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

314
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,750
Think she's full of crap?

315
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,672
You really have
to ask me that?

316
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,752
You done giving
your statement?

317
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,911
Green guy with
a bow and Arrow

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,560
takes down a weapons deal
and saves my ass.

319
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,376
If you ask me, you should
be helping this guy,

320
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,914
not hunting him down,

321
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,593
especially with Diaz
still out there.

322
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,753
Diaz has been gone
for months,

323
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,513
and the FBI still has
its eye on us.

324
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,671
So as much as I doubt
Laurel's motives...

325
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,558
and, uh, believe me,
I do...

326
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,757
taking a hard-line stance
was the right play,

327
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,911
because if agent Watson
even so much as suspects

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,434
we have something to
do with this...

329
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,840
our immunity goes <i>adios.</i>

330
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,912
That's right. And that's
why we have got to find

331
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,032
this Green Arrow wannabe
and shut him down.

332
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,557
Rene, we all agreed,
for better or for worse,

333
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,199
we were not gonna go out
as vigilantes.

334
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,556
Otherwise, what was
Oliver's sacrifice for?

335
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,552
OK, so we're supposed
to just ignore

336
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,075
the rising crime rate
and do nothing about it?

337
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,391
Actually, I think risking
my officers every day

338
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,073
fighting to maintain
law and order is

339
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,230
doing something
about it.

340
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,357
I... I get that, d.,

341
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,439
but Oliver asked us
to carry on.

342
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,919
So whoever's behind
that mask is doing

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,434
what we're supposed
to be doing.

344
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,637
But he's not
helping the problem.

345
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,030
Actually, he's
making it worse.

346
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,638
Rene, I'm not saying

347
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,757
that we can't still be
heroes to this city.

348
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
We just have to do it in a little bit
of a different way.

349
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,032
So where you at
finding this wannabe?

350
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,874
Well, we retrieved a few
Arrows from the scene,

351
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,838
but forensics still
turned up empty.

352
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,320
But what about the perp?

353
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,392
Any pattern as to how he's
selecting his targets?

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,196
This weapons dealer has
a rap sheet 12 feet long.

355
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,396
He was an obvious mark.

356
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,153
But this first guy...
stent...

357
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,835
I still haven't figured out
how he fits into the puzzle.

358
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,320
You don't think he's
innocent.

359
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
This guy? Hell, no.

360
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
But his rap sheet's
only clean

361
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,760
because he paid
to make sure it was.

362
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,296
Well, it looks like you
might have to take

363
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,834
a deep dive through
his financials.

364
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,240
Yeah.
But I can't exactly

365
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,073
subpoena his records
based on a hunch.

366
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,556
Who said anything about
a subpoena?

367
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,472
I really miss this, guys.

368
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,870
Not that I don't like being
the head of R&D at A.R.G.U.S.

369
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,475
It has better benefits,
as in there are actually benefits.

370
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I just miss the team.

371
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,696
Less talking,
more typing.

372
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,916
Right! Sorry. Uh, it should
only be a couple of minutes

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,040
before I'm in, which Felicity
could beat one-handed.

374
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Miss her.

375
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,317
I really appreciate
the assist here, you guys.

376
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,073
You especially, John.

377
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,056
I know you've been in some
hot water here at A.R.G.U.S.,

378
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,056
burning so many of their
resources going after Diaz.

379
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,673
Well, Lyla's down
at HQ right now,

380
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
trying to smooth
things over.

381
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:29,877
Besides, I want to get this
Green Arrow imposter

382
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,280
off the streets
as bad as you.

383
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,033
I don't want Watson
thinking that Oliver

384
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,954
set this in motion
in some type of way.

385
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,838
There's enough
trouble as it is.

386
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,149
How's he holding up?

387
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,478
He's surviving.

388
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,416
- And that's a bingo.
- What did you find?

389
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,896
How stent's been
making his money.

390
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,216
And it's not from
defrauding pensions.

391
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,754
He's been peddling
black-market arms.

392
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,072
What kind of dumbass leaves
his entire criminal enterprise online?

393
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,038
He was actually
pretty smart about it.

394
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,839
He kept himself clean,
off the radar,

395
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,799
activities washed through
a series of shell corporations.

396
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,712
I just happen
to be smarter. Boo-ya.

397
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,712
So this is how the
targets are connected.

398
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,792
Stent supplied the weapons,
Medina sold them.

399
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,896
The vigilante's trying to shut down
stent's whole network.

400
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,310
Yeah. And according to this text
exchange, he's panicked.

401
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,336
Stent's trying to sell the rest
of his inventory off

402
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,714
in a huge buy tonight.

403
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,519
Do we have
a location?

404
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,114
Not until an hour
before the buy.

405
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,240
I'll keep you guys posted.

406
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,200
That's where we'll find
our Green Arrow wannabe.

407
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,911
So, uh, any guesses
on who this might be?

408
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,310
Well, my money was on John.

409
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,880
Whoever it is,

410
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,191
they won't be hiding
under the hood for long.

411
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,432
If you don't hear from me in
a week, I'm not coming back.

412
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,193
I hope you do.

413
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,953
You know, you pay me
a lot of money to do

414
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,111
very stupid things.

415
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,880
Always a pleasure.

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,196
This food isn't as bad as
I thought it'd be...

417
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,511
You can't sit here.

418
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,514
It's just like high school.

419
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,240
I don't really know how
to be much clearer

420
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,397
than I've been being.

421
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,795
Go away.

422
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,837
So what do you think
about your replacement?

423
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,696
It's got to bug you there's
a new guy that can do

424
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,677
all the things that you
can't do anymore.

425
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,470
OK. Just because I have decided
to let you sit here

426
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,256
doesn't mean that we're
having a conversation.

427
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,634
You understand?

428
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,830
- You ready to hustle?
- No.

429
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,358
Listen, if you try to
leverage my family ever again,

430
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,955
I will expose whatever
it is you have going on

431
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,839
to every single guard
in here.

432
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,957
Disappointed to hear that.

433
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,557
We'll just have to try
this a different way.

434
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,640
This your new friend?

435
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,997
It's nothing
to do with him.

436
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,753
- It is now.
- I didn't do anything.

437
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,599
Do you want to come
with us now, Queen?

438
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,516
No.

439
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,829
Oliver.

440
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,513
I can't help you.

441
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,478
Oliver... Don't.

442
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,634
Don't. Please... uh! Uh!

443
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,912
Looking pretty crazy
out there.

444
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,400
I wanted everyone
ready to move

445
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,914
the second Curtis
has a location.

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,719
With any luck, we'll
establish a perimeter

447
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,314
and gain some lead time.

448
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,279
And if that vigilante
shows up?

449
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,079
Then we take him
down, too.

450
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,376
I still don't think
you should do that.

451
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,915
I thought we
settled this, Rene.

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,117
For the last few months,
all I kept hearing is

453
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,078
how scared my kids at
the center were.

454
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,392
And then this Green Arrow
wannabe shows up,

455
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,949
and they have hope again.

456
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,793
So, to me, that's worth
a hell of a lot more

457
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,270
than our immunity deal,
rule of law,

458
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,080
whatever the hell crap
Laurel said.

459
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,751
Sometimes people just need
something to believe in.

460
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,513
Right. I get it, Rene.
I really do.

461
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,990
But how do you know you
can believe in this guy?

462
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,514
You don't know
what his motives are.

463
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,920
You don't even know
who he is.

464
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,469
I know he could've let
me die, and he didn't.

465
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,835
That's good enough for me.

466
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,560
Yeah? You sure
he saved you?

467
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,880
Or were you just not
his target?

468
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,519
Because there's a big,
big difference.

469
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Curtis?

470
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,074
The buy's going down
in an hour.

471
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,231
Old manufacturing plant
by the wharf.

472
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,554
You arrest
that vigilante, d.,

473
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,149
you're making
a big mistake.

474
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,039
No, Rene.
I'm doing my job.

475
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,433
Felicity...

476
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,077
Hey. Sorry. Did I wake you?

477
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,350
I couldn't sleep.

478
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,635
Everything OK?

479
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,598
I guess.

480
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,399
How was school today?

481
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,551
The same. It sucked.

482
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,552
Well, did you at least
crush your geometry test?

483
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,919
Yeah. I just miss
my old school.

484
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,957
And I miss old my job.

485
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,233
I really, really miss
your dad.

486
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,913
Me, too.

487
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,798
At least we still have
each other, right?

488
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,640
How much longer do we
have to stay here for?

489
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,633
I don't know.

490
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,316
Are you OK?

491
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,753
What do you care?

492
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,991
I'm not gonna
survive in here.

493
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,436
Yeah, you will.
You'll be fine.

494
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,513
You... you just left
me to die.

495
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,239
I...

496
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,716
I knew that they
didn't want to kill you

497
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,632
because they...

498
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,557
I knew that they
were coming after me.

499
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,757
So you just let them
beat the crap out of me?

500
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,994
I'm on the guards' radar

501
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,639
after what happened
the other day.

502
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,359
And I...

503
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,030
I get another strike
against me,

504
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,349
and I'm back
to square one,

505
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,750
and I want to get
back to my family.

506
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,593
I can't...

507
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,473
I can't do that to them.

508
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,834
I have family, too. Did
you ever think about that?

509
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,230
I mean, I shouldn't
even be in here.

510
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,312
I was wrongfully
accused of murder.

511
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,437
And that's what
the city's like now.

512
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,352
There's no justice.

513
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,951
Just keep your head
down, you'll be fine.

514
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,471
That... that's your advice?

515
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,640
All this time, I thought
you had a raw deal,

516
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,076
like I did.

517
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,674
But it makes sense now

518
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,440
why there's a new
Green Arrow out there.

519
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,240
Because the old one is
a coward.

520
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,430
<i>Lights out!</i>

521
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,633
There's close to $1 million
worth of product here.

522
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,393
All yours for 400k.

523
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,960
What's the catch?

524
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,838
I got burned out
on the business.

525
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,957
I decided to liquidate
for my mental health.

526
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,556
Stent's about to make
the exchange.

527
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,552
Should we move in?

528
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,109
We can make this bust
in our sleep.

529
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,032
I'm waiting
for the vigilante.

530
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,116
400k of assorted
cryptocurrencies,

531
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,759
as requested.

532
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
I do miss the old ways.

533
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,075
You mean a briefcase
full of money? No, thanks.

534
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,956
That's him. Move!

535
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,959
Please. I'll give
you anything.

536
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,155
I have what I came for.

537
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,999
Jason stent, you have
failed this city.

538
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,520
Drop your
weapon now.

539
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,434
Don't be stupid.

540
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,551
Vigilante heading north!

541
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,119
Where the hell
are you hiding?

542
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,714
I was just trying
to get free!

543
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,598
You never should have
come here.

544
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,999
Morning, 4587.

545
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,400
Beautiful day.

546
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,435
Ohh, you think I'd be sick
of coffee by now.

547
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,629
Will?

548
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,237
Heh heh. Hey, Erin,

549
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,710
you're a hard woman
to find.

550
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,678
No one to save
you now.

551
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,717
It's just
you and me.

552
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,439
I swear to god,
if you hurt him.

553
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,000
You're gonna do what?

554
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,515
You're gonna sic Oliver
after me?

555
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,159
Right now,
he's realizing

556
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,436
how difficult
prison life is.

557
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,238
What the hell do you want?

558
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,518
Pretty simple,
actually.

559
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,395
I want Oliver to spend

560
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,633
the rest of his life
in prison knowing

561
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,234
I killed his wife.

562
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,471
Oh, thank god,
you monologue. Run now!

563
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,116
No!

564
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,317
You're gonna suffer
for that.

565
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,759
The only reason you're
still breathing is

566
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,160
so you can hear
this message:

567
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,232
Diaz found Felicity.

568
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,515
Your wife is dead.

569
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,070
I, um...

570
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,992
I need to make a phone call.

571
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,400
Rough night, 4587?

572
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,630
I have reason to believe

573
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,951
that my family
has been attacked.

574
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,351
Please allow me to make
a phone call.

575
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,511
You know you don't have
phone privileges.

576
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,995
You got a visitor,
though.

577
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
You're OK.

578
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,234
How's William?

579
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,913
He's fine.

580
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,319
Are you?

581
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,073
I am now.

582
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,992
I've missed you.

583
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,752
I love you so much.

584
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,832
And I'm so sorry
that I wasn't there.

585
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,195
I should have been
there.

586
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,397
How could you have been?

587
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,113
The only reason
that I'm here is

588
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,873
to keep
you and William safe.

589
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,919
Yeah. I know.

590
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
I need you to tell John

591
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,711
to set the two of you up
with new identities.

592
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,359
I need...

593
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,280
I need you... I need
you back

594
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,397
in the witness
protection program.

595
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,674
I have William set up

596
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,231
at a boarding school
in Cambridge.

597
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,040
He leaves tomorrow.

598
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,230
You're not
going with him?

599
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,040
No, I'm not.

600
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,635
- Felicity...
- I'm done hiding, Oliver.

601
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,632
I'm done being a person
who doesn't fight back.

602
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,394
Diaz broke in, and all
I could think about was

603
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,193
protecting William.

604
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,193
I tried,
and I couldn't do it.

605
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,749
If A.R.G.U.S. hadn't gotten
there when they did...

606
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,674
Do you know what it
feels like

607
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,911
not being able
to protect your family?

608
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,676
I have lived with that feeling
every second

609
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,956
since I stepped
in here, Felicity.

610
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,309
Don't...

611
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,553
Don't tempt that,

612
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,235
please.

613
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,190
Please.

614
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,072
I am begging you
to go back

615
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,480
to witness
protection.

616
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,110
No. I won't.

617
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,032
You don't get to decide
this time, Oliver.

618
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,719
I love you,

619
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,438
and I will always...

620
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,434
Always wait for you.

621
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,112
But I can't
let what happened

622
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,277
to William and I
happen again.

623
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,714
I can't.

624
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,751
I have to fight back.

625
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,435
You, of all people,
understand that.

626
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,432
Time's up, 4587.

627
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,479
I... I need a bit more time.

628
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,153
And I don't care.

629
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,632
I love you.

630
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,474
OK. OK.

631
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,080
I love you.

632
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,840
Hey, guys, listen up.
I got some news.

633
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,080
We need more
duct tape, dad.

634
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,236
Not anymore, peanut.

635
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,118
We got ourselves
some new equipment.

636
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,476
I'm talking about
bags, gloves.

637
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,536
You were talking about you wanted
some new shoes, right?

638
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,630
We got that, too.

639
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,176
Hey, you win
the lottery or something?

640
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,840
Nah. I just got some help
from somebody looking out.

641
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,230
But I thought you said
the old stuff builds character.

642
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,119
That... that was before I knew
we would get newer stuff.

643
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Dad?

644
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,993
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. OK.

645
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,799
Uh, keep practicing.

646
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,155
And when we get back,

647
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,913
we're gonna be ripping
these bags apart.

648
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,990
Hey.
What's up, d.?

649
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,718
What brings you
to these parts?

650
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,919
Well, uh, a couple of mom and
pop shops called the precinct.

651
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,037
They said they opened up
to find cash waiting.

652
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,959
It seems like 15 other
hard-up businesses

653
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,834
from The Glades also got the same
exact amount that went missing

654
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,513
from the weapons buy
the other night.

655
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,195
So, uh, you wouldn't happen
to know anything about that,

656
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
would you?

657
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,556
Uh, no. No. I can't...

658
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,280
but it does sound like
the work of a hero, though.

659
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,079
That's what it
feels like.

660
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,674
I should be arresting you

661
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,831
for the crap you pulled
the other night.

662
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,594
Do you have any idea the position
you're putting me in, Rene?

663
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,194
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
d., all right?

664
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,953
But I couldn't let you
lock him up.

665
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,759
He's not a criminal,
and you know it.

666
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,115
No, I don't.

667
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,856
And it's not a leap of
faith I'm willing to take.

668
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,271
You know, I am working so hard
to restore the city's faith

669
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,239
in the men and women
who serve it.

670
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,872
Rene, if you go out there
as Wild Dog again,

671
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,077
I will not hesitate
to lock you up

672
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,958
just like that vigilante.

673
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,560
Are you serious, d.?

674
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,393
I just want you to think
long and hard

675
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,437
about what that means, OK?

676
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,834
For these kids and for Zoe

677
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,359
and for our city, man.

678
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,317
'Cause I'm not gonna give
you a second warning.

679
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

680
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,036
How is he?

681
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,555
Quiet. Reading, mostly.

682
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,315
- I'll give you two a minute.
- Thank you.

683
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Hey.

684
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,036
Did you see him?

685
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,554
I did.

686
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,714
I wish I could've come
with you.

687
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,951
Yeah, me, too.

688
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,960
It's too dangerous.

689
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,274
No one can know
that you're here.

690
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,917
Hey, I got something
for you.

691
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,990
What's this?

692
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,117
It's a symbol of
reconnection.

693
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,416
Your Aunt Thea gave it to me
before she left town,

694
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,318
and it's something your
father had given her.

695
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,990
As long
as you have this,

696
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,436
I will always be able
to find you.

697
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,239
I don't understand.

698
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,195
You have to go
somewhere.

699
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,152
It's super-super safe.

700
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,476
I can't come with you.

701
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,279
- You're leaving me.
- I'm not leaving you.

702
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,397
It's only temporary, OK?

703
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,870
Just until we get Diaz,
I promise.

704
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,236
And then as soon as we do,
I'm gonna come get you.

705
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,959
It's all gonna be over...

706
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,872
I swear.

707
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,120
Check it out.

708
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,033
Queen, you don't look
too hot there.

709
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,669
Maybe I can help you... uh!

710
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,840
Stand down.

711
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,355
Don't be a hero.

712
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,912
You should've killed me.

713
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,715
Who sent you?

714
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,314
No one.

715
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,073
But you knew my father.

716
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,117
How am I supposed to know
who your old man is?

717
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,152
No.

718
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,879
My father...

719
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,440
Is Oliver Queen.

720
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,079
William?

721
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,594
Greg, move your head!
