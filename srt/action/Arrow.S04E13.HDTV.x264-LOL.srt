00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:02,928
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,860
Who's the blackmailer?

3
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:05,294
He calls himself
the Calculator.

4
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,782
Well, Calculator
now has everything he needs

5
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:09,016
to melt the Internet.

6
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,164
Oh, my God. Dad?

7
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:13,974
Taiana, I need to
tell you something.

8
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:15,443
I killed your brother.

9
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,547
Thea!

10
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:21,982
What's happening?

11
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:23,317
It's the wound
from Ra's.

12
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:24,919
If the life she
owes doesn't come

13
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,420
from taking others,
it will come

14
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:28,289
from the life
of the host.

15
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,291
Thea, please don't go.

16
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:36,430
There's only one way
to prevent that.

17
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,499
My father once told me
of an elixir known

18
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:40,101
as the Lotus,

19
00:00:40,103 --> 00:00:41,535
and I will freely give
it to you on one condition.

20
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:44,171
I want you to kill
Malcolm Merlyn.

21
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:46,841
If you cared
about Thea,

22
00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:48,175
then curing
her bloodlust

23
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:49,910
wouldn't come
with any conditions.

24
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:52,113
Thea is my
sister-in-law.

25
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,347
You are my husband.

26
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:54,582
I'm not your husband.

27
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:56,517
But war does not know
family bonds

28
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,219
nor friendly sentiments.

29
00:00:58,221 --> 00:00:59,820
Who are you
at war with?

30
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,589
I just told you I want you
to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

31
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:03,224
Try to guess.

32
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:05,226
Hey, hey.

33
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:06,994
If you have
a problem

34
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:08,529
with Malcolm Merlyn,

35
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,964
deal with it
yourself.

36
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:12,433
Do not involve me
or my sister.

37
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:14,969
You put the Demon's Head
ring on Malcolm's hand.

38
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:18,038
You--

39
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,540
You can't
defeat him.

40
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:22,877
But you can.
You have.

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,145
And that was
before I knew

42
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:26,013
that he was
my sister's father.

43
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:27,481
So he dies
so his child might live.

44
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:30,084
Didn't your father make
a similar bargain?

45
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:31,419
I'm sorry, Oliver.

46
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,820
I would not resort
to this

47
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:34,155
if I had
any other choice.

48
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:37,358
Nyssa, my sister
is dying

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,361
because of something
that your father did.

50
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:41,929
I think you have
every choice.

51
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:46,200
Thea is dying because
of what her father did.

52
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:49,770
I am only following events
to their inevitable conclusion.

You know, it's strange,

56
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:11,892
watching your baby girl
drink coffee.

57
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:13,461
Yeah. It would probably
be a little less strange

58
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:15,596
if you'd seen your
baby girl in the last 18 years.

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:17,898
You're right.

60
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,600
I don't suppose it
helps

61
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:21,335
if I say that I thought
staying out of your life

62
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:23,103
was the best thing
for you.

63
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:25,105
I was protecting you
and your mother.

64
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:27,141
You were protecting
yourself.

65
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,309
You were wanted
by the police,

66
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:29,477
and you didn't want
to go to jail.

67
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,345
That is why you
stayed away.

68
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,047
And you know why
the police were after me,

69
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:34,949
the type of criminal
I was?

70
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,051
Mom never went
into detail.

71
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:38,185
I assume petty stuff.

72
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,620
Anything else requires
commitment.

73
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:41,922
Well, I'm here now,

74
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,424
and I want us
to speak openly.

75
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:45,493
I'll answer
any questions you have.

76
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:48,028
Ok. I just have one
at the moment.

77
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,163
Why now?

78
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:51,999
I was doing a job
for someone.

79
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,869
Almost got beat, almost.

80
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:58,439
My adversary had
exceptional skills.

81
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,107
My curiosity piqued.

82
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,809
I investigated further.

83
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,879
Imagine
what I discovered...

84
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,514
Overwatch.

85
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,186
Bye.

86
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:13,320
See you never.

87
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:14,288
Felicity, wait.

88
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,789
It is not
what you think.

89
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,792
My employer, my work
is hardly diabolical.

90
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:20,861
I'll be sure to tell that to
my friend who you blackmailed.

91
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:23,497
Short-term legal mischief
for long-term societal game.

92
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,966
Isn't that kind
of hacktivism exactly

93
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,301
what you did at MIT?

94
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:28,836
Is it really
all that different

95
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:32,306
from the vigilantism
you practice today?

96
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:34,241
We are the same,
you and I.

97
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:36,911
I am pretty sure
that I didn't try

98
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:38,846
to kill 8,000 people.

99
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:41,348
An empty threat,
I swear to you.

100
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,950
I know I have no right.

101
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:44,184
I'm asking for a chance,

102
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:45,953
a chance to prove to you

103
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,354
that I'm not a bad guy

104
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:51,692
and that I'm not
a "bad guy."

105
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:53,127
What is that?

106
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:54,662
A record of some
of the hacks I've done

107
00:03:54,664 --> 00:03:56,196
throughout the years.

108
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:57,464
I've selected ones that
could be verified

109
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,266
by news accounts
so you know

110
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:00,534
I'm telling the truth.

111
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:03,137
This is very simple
for me, Felicity.

112
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,172
I want to be back
in your life.

113
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:06,407
I know that doing that
will require

114
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,175
earning your trust back.

115
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:10,511
I hope this is
a first step

116
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:12,813
down that very long road.

117
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:24,258
So Nyssa's holding
Thea's life hostage

118
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,226
until you kill
Malcolm Merlyn?

119
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:27,561
I would be surprised
if she wasn't

120
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:28,996
the daughter
of the Demon.

121
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:30,598
That's not funny, John.

122
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,099
No, it's not.
Thea's dying.

123
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,300
She has one,
maybe two days,

124
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:34,568
and if we can
save her

125
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,270
by killing the man
that killed my sister,

126
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:37,638
then how could you
even think twice about that?

127
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,106
I'm not gonna
defend Malcolm.

128
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:40,307
He orchestrated
your sister's murder,

129
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:43,010
he killed Tommy.

130
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,378
Nothing is ever gonna
changed the fact

131
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,980
that he is Thea's family.

132
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,681
I don't know how much
you remember of my father,

133
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,316
but he was not
a good man,

134
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:52,119
he threw in
with Malcolm Merlyn,

135
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:54,054
and all of that being said,
there is nothing

136
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:56,423
that I wouldn't do
to have him back.

137
00:04:56,425 --> 00:05:00,427
So you tell me how am I supposed to
take that away from Thea?

138
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:01,695
But, Oliver, what's
the difference if Thea dies?

139
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:03,030
It doesn't have to
come to that, John.

140
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:04,493
There's more than
one choice here.

141
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:05,155
Like what?

142
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,701
Diplomacy.

143
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,402
What does Nyssa want?

144
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:11,105
I mean, all Nyssa really wants
is control of the League,

145
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,941
so I need to convince
Merlin to give her the ring,

146
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:18,045
she gives us the cure,
and no one has to die.

147
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:21,248
Laurel, can you convince Nyssa
to go along with that?

148
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,217
Yeah. It's easier
than talking Malcolm into it.

149
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,386
Well, let me worry
about Malcolm.

150
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:30,991
I don't understand.

151
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:34,728
Why would you save me
only to kill my brother?

152
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,196
Vlad attacked me.

153
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:37,731
Vlad would never do
such a thing.

154
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,533
I was defending
myself,

155
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,168
and I did not know
he was your brother.

156
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,603
Would that have made
a difference?

157
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:43,971
I didn't
have a choice.

158
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:45,572
There is always
a choice.

159
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:48,008
I couldn't just
let him kill me.

160
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,276
I'm done with you.

161
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:52,379
Taiana, I have
something that Reiter wants.

162
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:56,183
Where did you
get that?

163
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:59,219
It doesn't matter.

164
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:01,388
I think that we can
use this against him.

165
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,157
I have a better idea.

166
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,625
- Hey!
- Hey, Tai--

167
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:06,293
Get Reiter.

168
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:08,328
Tell him I want to
talk to him.

169
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,330
I have something
that he wants.

170
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:21,408
Let me see if I've
got this right.

171
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,278
There's a magic potion
that could cure Thea's bloodlust

172
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,612
that we've never
heard of

173
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:28,549
but Nyssa
conveniently has.

174
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,285
I've been holding off
telling you this for years, Oliver.

175
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,753
You're very handsome,

176
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:34,988
not especially bright.

177
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,623
Bright enough
to have checked.

178
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,093
It's called the Lotus.

179
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:43,564
Tatsu Yamashiro is part of the order
who guards it--or did.

180
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,199
They gave it to Nyssa,

181
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,535
and if we don't get her
to give it to Thea now...

182
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,638
We're gonna lose her.

183
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,108
Even assuming such
an elixir existed,

184
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,977
even assuming
Miss Yamashiro's order

185
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,645
parted with it
willingly,

186
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:00,280
even assuming
Nyssa Al Ghul's words

187
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:02,983
could be trusted,
then yes.

188
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,485
Of course I'd do anything to
save my daughter,

189
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:07,654
but none of that
is true, Oliver.

190
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:10,557
Look. I appreciate
you're trying to embrace

191
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,960
a more optimistic
viewpoint these days--

192
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:15,162
Malcolm, we're talking
about your daughter.

193
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:19,066
Yes, and I need to do
something to save her,

194
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,335
and you need to stop
wasting my time

195
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:23,704
with Nyssa Al Ghul's
games.

196
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,115
We found her
at the perimeter.

197
00:07:35,117 --> 00:07:36,450
She claims to be
a friend.

198
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,051
And she speaks
the truth,

199
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,187
at least until she
defiled my beloved

200
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:42,356
and stood idly by
while I was left to rot

201
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:43,991
in a dungeon.

202
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,292
Leave us.

203
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,331
Nyssa...

204
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,499
How is my beloved?

205
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,434
Sara's good.
She's whole.

206
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:55,569
I think she's happy.

207
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,137
If you're here
about Thea--

208
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,305
Nyssa, what are
you doing?

209
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:00,140
Protecting
my birthright.

210
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,708
By holding Thea's
life hostage?

211
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,644
You say that as if
she didn't fire the arrows

212
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,245
that felled
your sister.

213
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,613
You and I both
know that wasn't her doing.

214
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:10,184
Yes. It was
Malcolm Merlyn,

215
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:12,553
and the time has come
for recompense.

216
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,922
I will never
forgive Merlyn

217
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:16,256
for all the horrible
things that he's done.

218
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:19,593
He's taken people,
two very special people

219
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,028
away from me.

220
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,396
Don't you think
I want him dead?

221
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:23,931
Then why are you here?

222
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,199
Because if you want
Merlyn dead,

223
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,433
then you have to
drive that sword,

224
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:28,669
and if you can't
or if you won't,

225
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,371
then we'll need to
negotiate a compromise.

226
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:36,276
You have my attention.

227
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:39,646
Oliver convinces Merlyn
to give up the power,

228
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,215
and you...

229
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,520
And you give us
the cure.

230
00:08:46,522 --> 00:08:49,189
I would accept
those terms,

231
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,591
but Merlyn
never will.

232
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,125
Let us worry
about that.

233
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:53,460
And by "us," you
mean my husband?

234
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,729
Oliver's speaking
with Merlyn right now,

235
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:58,532
and Merlyn--he is
a bastard,

236
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:01,168
but there is nothing that he wouldn't do
to save his daughter.

237
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,972
I hope so
because if he doesn't

238
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,640
it won't just be
Thea's life that is forfeit.

239
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,242
What do you mean?

240
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:21,622
There will be war,
and the streets

241
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:23,457
of your home
will run red

242
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,459
with the blood
of our enemies,

243
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,828
whomever
they may be.

244
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:36,958
How'd it go
with Merlyn?

245
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,427
Not good. Nyssa?

246
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,445
She brought an army,
but if you get her the ring,

247
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,997
she'll play ball.

248
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,533
We can get this done
with no one getting hurt.

249
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:47,001
Everything all right?

250
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,235
No, not really.
I mean, it's not great.

251
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:49,971
It's just not quite
at the level

252
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:50,809
of "my sister's on her deathbed"
kind of bad, so...

253
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,976
What happened?

254
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:53,144
My dad came back.

255
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,578
And why is
that a bad thing?

256
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,113
Well, it's an extremely
long story,

257
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:58,082
but you remember the superhacker
who blackmailed Roy?

258
00:09:58,084 --> 00:09:59,617
- Same guy.
- What?

259
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:00,818
Your father is...

260
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,119
Calculator.
He showed up

261
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:03,621
at my Palmer Tech
presentation.

262
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:04,955
I had coffee
with him yesterday,

263
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:06,924
where he dropped
the Calculator bomb on me.

264
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,359
And why
would he do that?

265
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,628
Apparently now that
he knows what I do,

266
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,630
that we're both
"vigilantes,"

267
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:14,965
we have something
in common.

268
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:16,600
The sickest part is
I want to believe him.

269
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:18,336
I wish there were
some sort of test

270
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:20,271
I could do that would
prove that he is who he says he is.

271
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,806
A test is
a good idea.

272
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:23,708
It's a good idea
for you and for us.

273
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,309
I've got a way
to bring Merlyn

274
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:26,777
to the bargaining table.

275
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:33,184
I'm not usually one
to be summoned by my prisoners.

276
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:38,422
I heard you had
something for me.

277
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,858
Taiana, please. No.

278
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,194
I have something
you want.

279
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,363
Let me out of this cage,
and it's yours.

280
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:47,131
Show me
what you have.

281
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:56,340
Magnificent.

282
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,942
Do we have a deal?

283
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:01,579
A deal?

284
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:02,980
You misunderstood.

285
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:05,049
It's mine
either way.

286
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:07,084
Ohh!

287
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:08,819
I cannot stay here,
Reiter.

288
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,054
This man killed
my brother.

289
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:11,655
And you will continue to
care for him

290
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,023
as if he were
your brother.

291
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:15,826
Mr. Queen is
an important piece

292
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:17,194
of my endeavor
on this island.

293
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:19,397
You'll stay with him
until he's well.

294
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,333
If his health gets worse,

295
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:24,235
you'll join him
in his fate.

296
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,895
Your left-side block
is slow.

297
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,997
Your next opponent
won't have my patience

298
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,965
or my mercy.

299
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,634
Clearly you don't
understand how this is

300
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,135
supposed to work,
my husband.

301
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:00,538
You were supposed to bring
the Magician with you.

302
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,040
Well, I need something
from you first--

303
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,842
proof that what
you're offering is real.

304
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:07,244
A stalling tactic.

305
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,079
Al Sa-Her thinks
me the fool

306
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,281
or that you're one.

307
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,749
Or maybe he doesn't
trust the woman

308
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:15,286
trying to take the Demon's Head
ring from him.

309
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:17,087
Can't imagine why.

310
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:20,060
Bring me a sample
of the Lotus.

311
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:24,865
I recognize
what you are doing.

312
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,566
Part of me
even respects it,

313
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,401
but the leadership
of the League of Assassins

314
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:29,970
is in the balance here.

315
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:31,505
It is naive to think
this can be resolved

316
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,273
without bloodshed.

317
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,682
This amount is not sufficient
to cure her permanently,

318
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:45,685
only to provide
the assurance Merlyn seeks.

319
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,090
Thank you, Nyssa.

320
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:55,228
As I said, someone
is going to die.

321
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,230
I pray it won't
be your sister.

322
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,341
Was it difficult to
get her discharged from the hospital?

323
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:11,078
No. I spoke
to Dr. Lamb.

324
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,512
Friend of the family.

325
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:18,552
Nyssa...

326
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:22,956
She hooked us up
with a sample of the cure.

327
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,459
This buys Thea
some more time,

328
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,160
and you get the proof
that you need.

329
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:28,628
Let's see it.

330
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,612
What are
Nyssa's terms?

331
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,781
You hand over the ring,

332
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:51,651
she gives us the rest
of the elixir,

333
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,286
and Thea lives.

334
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:54,654
When can we meet?

335
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,790
Tonight.

336
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,158
Laurel's with her now.

337
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:08,368
Hi! I got your--

338
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,137
Oh, no.

339
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,272
Oh, no. You have
Mr. Square Bear face.

340
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,473
What?

341
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,075
Mr. Square Bear.
Oh, my God.

342
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:16,476
You don't remember.
You lost him when you

343
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:17,644
were, like, 4 years old,

344
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,513
and you had
that exact--

345
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:20,814
you had that exact look
on your face.

346
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:22,115
Oh, baby.

347
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:23,450
Is it too much
to hope that you lost

348
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:24,918
a plushy toy?

349
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,954
No, but adjusting
for age and inflation,

350
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:29,856
might be just as bad.

351
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,791
Huh?

352
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:33,193
You want to sit?

353
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,796
What? What's up?

354
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:43,270
It's dad.

355
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:44,905
Noah--he's
in Star City.

356
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,640
What? How do you know?

357
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:47,741
He came to see me.

358
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,412
Did you talk
to him?

359
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:53,847
Yeah.

360
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,615
Are you all right?

361
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:57,751
Yeah. You sound like
you think he'd hurt me or something.

362
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:59,219
Yeah.

363
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:00,654
I've just been
doing some checking.

364
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:02,455
Is it possible
that he's not

365
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:03,723
the guy we
thought he was,

366
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,125
that maybe
he's better

367
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:06,493
than we thought
he was?

368
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,828
No.

369
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,897
Felicity, I would love
to think that your father

370
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,532
didn't show up
with some ulterior motive

371
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:13,967
in your life right now,

372
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,902
but I've been
where you are more times

373
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:18,738
than I care to admit,
and it always ends the same way.

374
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,840
He tells you exactly
what you want to hear,

375
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:22,809
and you get sucked in,

376
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:25,378
and the next thing you know,
you have no job,

377
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,547
no money,

378
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:28,682
and a sweet
7-year-old daughter

379
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:30,684
who needs
a new pair of shoes

380
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:33,220
and wants to go
to Space camp.

381
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:37,190
People don't change,

382
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:40,293
even if you
want them to.

383
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,528
Ok.

384
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,330
You're doing
the right thing.

385
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:45,699
I'm only entertaining
Oliver's naive plan

386
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:47,701
out of respect
for our marriage,

387
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:50,570
but his hope blinds him
to reality.

388
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,008
You come dressed
for battle, Al Sa-Her.

389
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,276
Just
for the occasion.

390
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:01,181
In exchange for
my daughter's life.

391
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:05,719
I'm glad you've
finally seen reason.

392
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:07,220
Sadly, the only
thing I have seen

393
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:10,423
is your quick
and speedy death.

394
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:11,691
Malcolm!

395
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:19,299
I knew you couldn't
be trusted.

396
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:21,935
You knew, and you
didn't prepare,

397
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:24,971
and here you are
outnumbered, outgunned,

398
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:28,408
out maneuvered
per usual.

399
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,442
Nyssa, don't!

400
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:31,611
Kill him!

401
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:33,546
We need to stop them
before they kill each other.

402
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,261
Retreat!

403
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:54,834
Don't let her
get away!

404
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:59,773
Malcolm,
stop this now!

405
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,174
Get out of my way,
Oliver!

406
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:02,142
Think about Thea!

407
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:03,710
Do not question
my love

408
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:04,944
for my daughter.

409
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:07,781
Everything I do,
I do it for her.

410
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:09,449
I'm not moving.

411
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:24,813
So much
for the Gandhi method.

412
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,897
Given who
we're dealing with,

413
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:28,331
we shouldn't be
surprised.

414
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,733
I can't believe
that being Ra's Al Ghul

415
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:31,001
is more important
to Malcolm

416
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:32,636
than saving
his daughter's life.

417
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:34,104
I know that you're
trying a new approach,

418
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:35,505
but just because
you've changed,

419
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:38,141
that doesn't mean
everybody else has.

420
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,643
We cannot allow
a League civil war.

421
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:42,612
Too many people
will be collateral damage.

422
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:43,980
And the 4 of us
definitely can't take on

423
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:45,816
two armies
of assassins.

424
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:47,284
Then we take down
the generals.

425
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,152
We need to work on
locating Nyssa and Malcolm.

426
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:51,121
But mainly Nyssa
because she's got

427
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:52,621
that whole Lotus
cure thing.

428
00:17:52,624 --> 00:17:54,124
We find both of them.

429
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:55,792
No one else dies
tonight.

430
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:59,296
Especially Thea.

431
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:09,506
You need this to keep
your fever at bay.

432
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:10,974
If it comes back,

433
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:13,310
well, that would be
very bad.

434
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:14,778
I'm surprised
you still care.

435
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,446
Baron Reiter made it
very clear

436
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:17,814
what happens to me
if you die.

437
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:20,817
Taiana, I know what
you're going through.

438
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:24,354
It's this feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

439
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:27,057
It's an emptiness--

440
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,226
Don't you dare try to
help me mourn

441
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:31,561
my brother that
you took from me.

442
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:32,829
Please just listen.

443
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,698
You know nothing
about how I feel!

444
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,733
A man with a heart
as small as yours

445
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:40,070
is incapable
of such things.

446
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:44,040
My father sacrificed
himself

447
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,909
so I could survive,

448
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:48,011
so that I could
right his wrong.

449
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:52,082
He did it
by pulling out a gun

450
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,750
and shooting himself
in the head

451
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:57,420
not 3 feet from me.

452
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:03,393
Since that day,
I have lost

453
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:07,230
4 more people
that I love,

454
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,765
that I cared
so much about.

455
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:13,036
It never
gets easier ever.

456
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,539
I could see it
in your eyes

457
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,941
from the moment
we first met.

458
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:19,676
That I was good?

459
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:24,614
No. That you were lost,
shattered.

460
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,119
There is a Russian saying--

461
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:32,322
"tot zhe molot chto
drobit steklo, kuyet stal."

462
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:36,593
"The same hammer
that shatters glass forges steel."

463
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:39,596
If you want to be the man
that your father wishes you to be,

464
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:41,398
then this is how
you'll get there.

465
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,602
You save us
from Reiter,

466
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:48,271
but you cannot
do that shattered.

467
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,250
Hey. Everyone's
telling the same story--

468
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:02,485
guys in black robes
fighting each other.

469
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,053
Yeah. League
of Assassins.

470
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:05,488
They're working on
some leadership issues.

471
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,623
Yeah, but how many
more people are gonna die

472
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,724
before that happens?

473
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:08,959
Yeah. We're working
on it.

474
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:10,627
You got to work faster.

475
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,963
This is just
the beginning.

476
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:13,930
Hey.

477
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:16,466
I think we need
to talk.

478
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:17,734
About what?

479
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:19,703
About the elephant
in the room.

480
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:22,339
The way this is going down,
it ends one way--

481
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:24,741
Malcolm Merlyn.

482
00:20:24,743 --> 00:20:26,176
He has to be taken
down, Oliver.

483
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:27,510
You're the only man
who's ever done it.

484
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:28,845
Malcolm's killed
hundreds of people.

485
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:31,114
He killed Tommy,
he killed Sara.

486
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:33,083
Thea is dying
right now because

487
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:34,784
of events that he
set in motion.

488
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:36,853
I have never
hated anyone

489
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:38,655
the way that
I hate him.

490
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:40,957
You've been
in denial, Oliver,

491
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,525
holding onto hope
with both hands

492
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:44,628
that you don't have to
give in to that hate,

493
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,097
use that hate to do
what needs to be done,

494
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:52,135
but, Oliver, this
needs to be done.

495
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:54,371
You have to kill
Malcolm Merlyn.

496
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,175
I'm glad you called.

497
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:01,111
Well, all your
files checked out,

498
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:02,979
and I did some additional
digging myself.

499
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:04,314
You're right.

500
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:09,019
You and I, we're
not all that different.

501
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:11,521
This facility is
really amazing.

502
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:14,090
Yes. After numerous
false starts

503
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:16,192
we finally got the R&D section
working like a Swiss watch.

504
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:19,262
This floor contains most
of our bleeding edge projects.

505
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:20,563
Ah.

506
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:24,334
That is an autonomous
communications device

507
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:26,236
3 generations
beyond Bluetooth.

508
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:27,971
But there are no seams
in the casing.

509
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:30,173
I know. It's built
from a single piece of aluminum.

510
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:33,310
The entire surface connects
to an induction charger.

511
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,377
How did you achieve
the heat sink?

512
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,612
Curtis Holt achieved
it actually.

513
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:37,414
He's quite the genius.

514
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,815
Don't sell
yourself short.

515
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:40,917
You're the Steve Jobs
in this equation.

516
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,085
Heh.

517
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,553
Thank you for agreeing
to give me

518
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:44,554
a second chance.

519
00:21:44,556 --> 00:21:46,089
Baby steps then.

520
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:49,025
Baby steps.

521
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:50,694
Hmm.

522
00:21:57,703 --> 00:22:00,070
I have eyes on Nyssa.

523
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:01,972
Abandoned complex
at 7th and Rucka.

524
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:04,975
Put the word out
among our assets in Star City.

525
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:08,011
Whoever leads us to Al Sa-Her will be
rewarded handsomely.

526
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:09,913
Keep her there.
We're on our way.

527
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:12,882
Nyssa, stop!

528
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:14,417
- Step aside, Laurel.
- No.

529
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:16,353
I will not let you wage
your war in my city.

530
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:18,455
I bargained
in good faith.

531
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:19,589
I'm only finishing
what he started,

532
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:21,024
and I aim to end
it swiftly.

533
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:22,525
To what cost?
How many lives

534
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:24,227
will you sacrifice
for what?

535
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:26,262
I will only say
this once more.

536
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:27,697
Step aside.

537
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:29,432
No. You're coming
with me.

538
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,934
Am I?

539
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:34,337
We're under attack!

540
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,279
We have to get
out of here.

541
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:44,881
Run!

542
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,947
Go! Get inside.

543
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:52,048
Cowards just like
their master.

544
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,416
Sorry, Nyssa.

545
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:54,551
For what?

546
00:23:58,323 --> 00:23:59,722
For that.

547
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,139
I was in a cell
much like this one

548
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:11,975
barely a year ago.

549
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:14,477
Nyssa, where is
the Lotus?

550
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,946
Safe.

551
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:17,948
This isn't a game,
Nyssa.

552
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,950
Thea is dying,
innocent civilians are dying,

553
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:21,885
your own men
are dying.

554
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:23,153
And surrendering
my only leverage

555
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:24,321
will not save
their lives.

556
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:26,556
No, but it will
save Thea's.

557
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,293
How could you be
so selfish?

558
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:31,962
A question better put
to Malcolm Merlyn.

559
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:35,332
He doesn't have
the cure, you do.

560
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:37,534
Using Thea's life
as a bargaining chip,

561
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:39,136
letting people die
for a lost cause--

562
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:42,639
Nyssa, this isn't
who you are.

563
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:45,208
It's who
your father was,

564
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,511
but he's gone,
he's dead,

565
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:50,280
and you can
finally be free.

566
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:01,558
Any luck?

567
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,359
Malcolm and the League
have gone to ground,

568
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:04,761
Nyssa is a brick wall,

569
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:07,396
John and Laurel are out
searching for the Lotus,

570
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,201
but we are running
out of places to look.

571
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:12,836
Well, that's
depressing.

572
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:16,373
Well, we will find it.
We have to.

573
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,374
Mm-hmm.

574
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,575
Is everything
all right?

575
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:20,177
Not really.

576
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,646
I mean, it's not
as bad as your sister being

577
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,215
unconscious in our sublevel,
but...

578
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:27,350
Did something happen
with your dad?

579
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:31,121
More like something
didn't happen.

580
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:33,557
What's that?

581
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,493
It's an IR burst
receiver,

582
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,229
incredibly advanced.

583
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:41,064
It can suck the data
out of any room

584
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,566
you put it into.

585
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:44,067
Don't worry.
I turned it off

586
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:45,213
before bringing
it down here.

587
00:25:45,214 --> 00:25:46,151
It's not yours?

588
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:48,175
It's my father's.

589
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:51,108
I gave him a little
tour of Curtis' R&D lab,

590
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,943
and he left this
behind as a souvenir.

591
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:55,412
He's trying to steal
from Palmer Tech?

592
00:25:55,414 --> 00:25:57,280
It was your idea
actually.

593
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:58,581
You needed proof
about the Lotus,

594
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:00,283
I needed proof
about my dad.

595
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:02,018
You set a trap
for him as a test.

596
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,322
Unrestricted access
to Palmer Technologies' R&D lab.

597
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:07,324
He flunked
with flying colors.

598
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:09,392
I don't even know
why I'm surprised.

599
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:11,895
You're surprised
because you're hoping

600
00:26:11,897 --> 00:26:15,365
that he's the parent
you've always wanted him to be,

601
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,100
the parent you deserve.

602
00:26:17,102 --> 00:26:19,069
In an extremely
ironic role reversal,

603
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,670
my mother was
smarter than me.

604
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:26,443
She said, "People
don't change,

605
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:28,078
no matter how much
you want them to."

606
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,317
Some people don't.

607
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:30,648
Uh-huh.

608
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,848
I'd like to think that
there's hope

609
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,119
for the rest of us,
or I did

610
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:38,955
as far as Malcolm
is concerned.

611
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:40,157
John thinks
I should kill him.

612
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,858
If it'd help save Thea,
I agree.

613
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,660
Yeah, and I'd agree
if he wasn't Thea's father,

614
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:44,861
but he is.

615
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:46,163
We are in this mess
because of him

616
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:47,764
on, like, a million
different levels.

617
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:50,000
Let's not pretend that
this is a typical

618
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:51,301
father-daughter
relationship.

619
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:54,104
He brainwashed her
into killing a friend.

620
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:57,007
I know all this.
I do,

621
00:26:57,009 --> 00:26:59,376
and I'm still
holding out hope

622
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:02,612
that with--with--
with time

623
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:04,981
and with how much
he says that he loves her

624
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:06,550
that maybe they have
some chance

625
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:09,986
at some type
of normal relationship.

626
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:11,621
If I kill him...

627
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,492
My sister never
gets that chance.

628
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:17,994
Thea's father is no more likely to
change than mine is.

629
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,898
What now?

630
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:23,720
Found Malcolm.

631
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:24,902
Where?

632
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:27,070
Right underneath us.

633
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,840
Malcolm!

634
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:35,511
The Lotus effect
is wearing off.

635
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:37,247
She will pass by sunrise.

636
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,782
I would like to be
by her side.

637
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,850
This has to end.

638
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:42,085
No more games.

639
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:44,688
You give Nyssa
the damn ring!

640
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,925
She was 4 months old
when we first met.

641
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:52,495
Your housekeeper Raisa,
I believe,

642
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:54,564
was picking you up
from our house

643
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:56,533
with Thea in a stroller.

644
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,569
I peeked my head
into the bassinette,

645
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:04,708
and Thea, all
of 16 weeks,

646
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,077
she stuck her tongue
out at me.

647
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:12,983
I always knew I was
connected to her,

648
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,418
as if on some primal level

649
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,722
I knew I was her father.

650
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:22,225
A real father wouldn't let
their child die

651
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:24,261
just to keep
his hands on power!

652
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:26,196
That is not
what I am doing.

653
00:28:26,198 --> 00:28:29,132
What's unfolding here
is larger than I,

654
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:30,934
and it is bigger
than my daughter.

655
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:33,203
It's not just her life that hangs in
the balance, Oliver.

656
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:37,406
For all your dealings
with the League,

657
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:39,075
you still remain ignorant
to what it is

658
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:40,543
they do for the world.

659
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:41,977
Enough
about the League.

660
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,346
You're a group
of Assassins.

661
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,282
It is a force of change

662
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:47,651
silently manipulating
global events

663
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:48,918
for hundreds of years,

664
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,821
and I cannot,
I will not put

665
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:56,760
that kind of power
into Nyssa Al Ghul's hands!

666
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:58,061
Let me ask you
something.

667
00:28:58,063 --> 00:29:01,298
If Damien Darhk came
to you and told you

668
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,635
to lay down your bow,
let him finish his plan for Star City,

669
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:08,004
would you do it?

670
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,640
Even if it meant
saving William's life?

671
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:17,947
I know everything
about you, Oliver.

672
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,452
I am Ra's Al Ghul,

673
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:24,654
but back
to the matter at hand.

674
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:28,258
You will never sacrifice
your city to save your son,

675
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,626
and believe me
when I tell you

676
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:32,429
that I am only making
the same choice.

677
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,630
No. I would look
for another choice,

678
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:35,131
and I wouldn't
stop looking

679
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:38,735
until there was
a third option!

680
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,370
Malcolm, what if--

681
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:45,341
what if you could
have the Lotus

682
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,743
and keep your ring?

683
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:49,346
I don't see how.

684
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:52,515
Nyssa's forces are stronger
than I care to admit.

685
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:53,650
Not by herself.

686
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:54,718
You challenge her

687
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,586
to a trial
by combat.

688
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,322
You do realize your plan
would end in her death?

689
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:06,262
We're all backed
into a corner, Malcolm.

690
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:07,831
Nyssa made her bed.

691
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,172
This is one of your
crazier ideas,

692
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:18,007
and that is
a competitive field.

693
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:20,710
Well, sit tight.
I have a crazier one coming.

694
00:30:29,054 --> 00:30:30,453
In deference
to good taste,

695
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:33,857
we will forego
the removal of shirts.

696
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,926
Let us be finished
with this charade.

697
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:38,328
As you wish.

698
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,174
Hold!

699
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:55,577
In the eyes of the League,

700
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,247
this woman is my wife.

701
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:02,619
As your husband,

702
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,054
I wish to fight
on her behalf.

703
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:15,982
I have never allowed
anyone to fight

704
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,183
my battles for me.

705
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:18,251
Do you want to
become Ra's,

706
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,285
or do you want
to die?

707
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:20,954
Why are you doing this?

708
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:22,388
You told me yourself you
couldn't defeat Merlyn,

709
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,357
and if I am forced
to choose

710
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,359
between your life
and his...

711
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,763
Then I will see
justice done.

712
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:44,244
I'm a little
disappointed I must say.

713
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,813
You're the one who put us
in this position, Malcolm.

714
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:49,215
Can I remind you
the role you played

715
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:51,150
in putting this ring
on my finger?

716
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:54,053
Oh, I remember.

717
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:56,256
Tonight I correct
that mistake.

718
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:58,091
I can't believe it.

719
00:31:58,093 --> 00:32:01,761
You've grown even more foolish
with experience.

720
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:03,496
3 years!

721
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,300
Let's finish this.

722
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,711
Unh!

723
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:36,496
Last chance, Malcolm.
Yield!

724
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:37,664
Never.

725
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,565
To end this,

726
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:41,034
you must kill me.

727
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:44,871
But you always
knew that, Oliver.

728
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:46,506
I didn't want it
to end this way.

729
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:47,974
Spare me
the false sympathy.

730
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:49,442
Just do it.

731
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,553
Aah! Err!

732
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,686
Bring me the Lotus.

733
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:50,303
You are Ra's Al Ghul.

734
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:51,871
Thank you, husband.

735
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,443
What--what is
going on?

736
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:21,112
Is everything ok?

737
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:23,981
That, uh, depends.

738
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:25,516
How are you feeling?

739
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:29,387
I'm--ahem--I'm
a bit tired,

740
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:32,356
but--

741
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:33,791
What am I doing here?

742
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:35,493
It's a long story,
but to shorthand it--

743
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:37,862
Is that you're
gonna be fine.

744
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:41,432
The cure worked.
No more bloodlust.

745
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:44,535
Come on. Let's go get you
into some regular clothes.

746
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:46,804
Yeah. Um...

747
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:51,375
Oliver, you did
it, man.

748
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:53,978
Thea's fine,

749
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,379
and Nyssa and Merlyn
didn't have to die.

750
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:57,181
Ooh, yeah. Not to be
the buzzkill,

751
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:59,750
but when are we gonna
tell Thea about Malcolm's mmmrrr?

752
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:00,949
Baby steps.

753
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,315
Right.

754
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:03,989
What's up?

755
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,489
Something my father said.

756
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,562
Brought you
a portable ramp,

757
00:35:11,564 --> 00:35:12,830
so anytime you come
across a higher surface,

758
00:35:12,832 --> 00:35:14,565
just unfold it.

759
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:16,667
This will get you
over almost anything.

760
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:19,737
Look. I have
a meeting in a few.

761
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:21,272
I just wanted to
say good-bye.

762
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:23,240
Good-bye?

763
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:24,775
We're just starting
to get to know each other.

764
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:26,977
I think I know everything
I need to know.

765
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:28,412
Felicity, what
is going on?

766
00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:31,315
I--I thought we
were making progress.

767
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:33,084
When I was a girl,
I hated myself.

768
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:35,286
I thought I was broken,
that no one could

769
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:37,021
or ever would love me.

770
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:38,255
It's the only way
a child can grow up

771
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:40,357
when their father
abandons them.

772
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:41,859
Felicity--

773
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:43,394
All I ever wanted to
know was why.

774
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:46,564
What was so wrong
with me that you would leave?

775
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:50,267
There was nothing
with you, sweetheart.

776
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:51,702
There was everything
wrong with me.

777
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,437
The police, the FBI,
they were never going to

778
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:55,906
stop looking for me.

779
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:57,241
I realized a life
on the run,

780
00:35:57,243 --> 00:35:59,276
that wasn't the life
that I owed you

781
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:01,545
or your mother,

782
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:03,047
so I disappeared.

783
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:04,949
You thought you were
doing the right thing for us.

784
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:07,051
Exactly.

785
00:36:07,053 --> 00:36:09,220
I have waited
my entire life

786
00:36:09,222 --> 00:36:11,388
for that explanation,

787
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,625
and the thing is
I don't even know if I believe it.

788
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:16,060
It's the truth.

789
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,428
There is only one part
of your story

790
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,929
that I know to be true,

791
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:21,465
and that is that you
are wanted by the police.

792
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:25,469
Felicity--

793
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:26,937
I just need you to know
one thing.

794
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:28,806
You are wrong.

795
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:30,574
I am nothing like you.

796
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:31,909
Felicity.

797
00:36:31,911 --> 00:36:33,077
Noah Kuttler,
you're under arrest.

798
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,478
You have the right
to remain silent.

799
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,046
- Anything you say can...
- Felicity, no.

800
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:37,414
And will be used
against you in a court of law.

801
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,283
Don't do--
don't do this.

802
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:46,323
Thank you both
for coming.

803
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:47,758
How is Thea?

804
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,093
Don't pretend
like you care.

805
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:52,129
I do. She's
my sister-in-law,

806
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:53,631
and her condition is
the result

807
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:54,932
of my father's blade.

808
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,100
You were right.

809
00:36:56,102 --> 00:36:57,601
Even after his death,
I remained

810
00:36:57,603 --> 00:36:59,069
my father's prisoner.

811
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:00,638
I allowed him to turn me
into someone

812
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,107
you showed me
I don't have to be...

813
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:07,311
And you showed me, as well,
when you took up the sword

814
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:10,147
to save my life.

815
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:14,185
You both showed me
what needed to be done.

816
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:15,719
And what's that?

817
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:18,022
Patience, please.
We're waiting for one other.

818
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:22,092
Thank you for coming,
Al Sa-Her.

819
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:24,295
You're Ra's.
I had no choice.

820
00:37:24,297 --> 00:37:26,831
And so you are
mistaken once again.

821
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:32,036
What are you doing?

822
00:37:44,684 --> 00:37:46,150
Earlier today,
I disbanded

823
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:48,418
the League of Assassins.

824
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,120
I released its forces

825
00:37:50,122 --> 00:37:54,925
much as my father
had released you long ago.

826
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:58,863
No one will be held prisoner
by my father any longer.

827
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,242
I thought of you
as a son once, Oliver.

828
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:15,379
I had more in common
with you than my own blood,

829
00:38:15,381 --> 00:38:19,183
but that's not the reason
why I'm not going to kill you.

830
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,385
Neither the fact

831
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:23,020
that you are
my daughter's brother.

832
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:24,855
The reason you get
to live

833
00:38:24,857 --> 00:38:27,524
is because death
would be a mercy compared

834
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:31,362
to the debt I now
owe you.

835
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:34,732
Don't you dare
threaten me, Malcolm.

836
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:41,005
Taiana.

837
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:48,479
I promise I will
free your friends for Vlad.

838
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:51,215
Vlad is dead.

839
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:53,484
We do this for them.

840
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:55,886
Mr. Queen.

841
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:58,322
I hope you have
regained your strength.

842
00:38:58,324 --> 00:39:00,891
The stone you gave me
was the final piece of the puzzle,

843
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:02,626
the final map.

844
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:03,910
We are going to dig.

845
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,096
Dig?

846
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:07,798
The heaven I seek
is not above

847
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,101
but rather
beneath our feet.

848
00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:12,636
We dig at daybreak.

849
00:39:19,412 --> 00:39:21,578
Hey.

850
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,080
You feeling
any better?

851
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:26,150
I don't even know
why I'm so upset.

852
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:27,551
Doesn't every
long-awaited

853
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:29,053
father-daughter
reunion end

854
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:30,654
with the dad being taken away
in handcuffs.

855
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:32,923
You don't have to be
funny for me.

856
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:34,458
You know that, right?

857
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,760
I know.

858
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:38,095
And I know I did
the right thing,

859
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:40,264
but...

860
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:41,699
The look on his face
when he realized

861
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:43,267
I had turned him in,

862
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,235
it's gonna haunt me
for the rest of my life,

863
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:46,470
and I can't help
but think he doesn't

864
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:47,972
even deserve that
kind of remorse.

865
00:39:47,974 --> 00:39:50,274
I think that remorse
is a pretty clear indicator

866
00:39:50,276 --> 00:39:53,010
that you are a very different
person than him.

867
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:55,112
Maybe Thea and I
could make T-shirts.

868
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:57,481
We could join a club.

869
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:59,083
Listen to me.
Don't make the mistake

870
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:01,652
of thinking that this thing
with your dad is over.

871
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:04,989
I can tell you
from experience

872
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:07,391
that closure does not
come that easily.

873
00:40:07,393 --> 00:40:09,893
Hmm.

874
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:11,628
Speaking of closure,

875
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,264
are you punishing yourself
for betraying Malcolm?

876
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:15,574
Is that insane?

877
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:16,901
Yes,

878
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:19,403
but it's part of what makes you
the man I love.

879
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:20,904
John was right.

880
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:22,606
You were faced
with an impossible situation,

881
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:25,109
and you found
the best way out of it.

882
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:31,749
Will you marry me?

883
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,684
I think I already answered
that question.

884
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:35,986
Thea's better,
Andy's better,

885
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:38,622
things are quiet
on the Darhk front.

886
00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:41,358
I feel like this might
be our window,

887
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,993
and with everything
that we have gone through

888
00:40:42,995 --> 00:40:46,530
over the past few months,
I want you to tell me

889
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:48,332
why are we waiting?

890
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:49,797
Well, we'll have to plan it.

891
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:50,802
Mm-hmm.

892
00:40:50,803 --> 00:40:52,236
Maybe just
a small ceremony

893
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:54,371
with a few of our friends
and no caterers.

894
00:40:54,373 --> 00:40:56,073
My mom will
hate that.

895
00:40:58,411 --> 00:40:59,198
I'm in.

896
00:40:59,222 --> 00:40:59,911
Yeah.

897
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:01,345
Hmm.

898
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:11,221
I don't like to be
kept waiting.

899
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:13,157
My apologies.

900
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,159
I don't have the resources
I once had.

901
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,561
Yes. I'm aware of your recent
reversal of fortune.

902
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:19,430
I take it that's why you asked
for this meeting.

903
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:21,231
Well, I haven't come
empty-handed.

904
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:24,635
So to speak.

905
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:25,906
I have some information

906
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,903
that you might find
of particular interest.

907
00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:30,136
I know who Oliver Queen

908
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,908
cares about more than
anyone in the whole world.

909
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:35,053
Yeah, so do I.
We did a pretty good number on her

910
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,421
over the holidays.

911
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:38,423
It's not Felicity Smoak.

912
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:45,964
Who?

913
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:48,433
His son...

914
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:49,866
William.

915
00:41:54,246 --> 00:42:00,746
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

916
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:17,961
Greg!
Move your head.
