1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,493
<i>My name is
Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,378
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,798
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,342
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,795
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,755
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,220
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,302
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,099
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,264
The new police captain,
she's on my payroll,

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,224
<i>along with a few other
city officials.</i>

12
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,480
<i>See, guys like you never understand.</i>

13
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,313
<i>Why destroy a city,
when you could take it over?</i>

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,779
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

15
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,531
The injury caused his lung
to recollapse.

16
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,199
Oliver Queen, you're under arrest.

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,530
On what charges?

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,957
Murder, assault, burglary,
and kidnapping,

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,376
all stemming from your activity
as the Green Arrow.

20
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,494
I think I just found something.

21
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,170
There's a record on how Watson
found out you were Wild Dog.

22
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,338
There's an audio recording.

23
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,963
The FBI's provided definitive proof
that Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

24
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,544
I'm gonna release
the defendant on bail.

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,506
What's your name?

26
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,594
Laurel Lance.

27
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,514
- Ollie.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,316
Jean here has some good news for you.

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,565
I'm only used to good news
if it's accompanied by bad news.

30
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,193
Well, this news is unequivocal, Oliver.

31
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,608
I can get the case
against you dismissed.

32
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,651
Uh...

33
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,988
Have a seat. Tell me more.

34
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,453
I pored over the discovery documents
produced by the district attorney.

35
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,085
Apparently, the FBI leveraged
Rene Ramirez

36
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,161
to testify against you

37
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,124
based on surveillance that was leaked
by a known criminal.

38
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,253
Cayden James.

39
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,959
"Fruit of the poisonous tree."

40
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,969
It's a legal metaphor positing that

41
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,717
if the source of the evidence
is tainted,

42
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,139
the evidence itself is tainted.

43
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,179
Mr. James' actions
were not only illegal,

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,636
but his death makes it impossible

45
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,722
to corroborate the evidence
against Mr. Ramirez.

46
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,148
So, if there's no case against Rene,
there's no case against me.

47
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,691
We're going before Judge McGarvey

48
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,609
on my motion
to dismiss this afternoon.

49
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,903
Jean, you sure?

50
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,360
You can just make this go away?

51
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,157
Ollie, she's positive.

52
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,489
Okay, I know you're not used
to getting good news,

53
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,616
but this is what it sounds like.

54
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,041
Mr. Mayor, we got an emergency
at SCPD.

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,337
Like I said, it was accompanied
by some bad news.

56
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,756
Jean, this is wonderful.

57
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,174
I will see you at the courthouse
this afternoon.

58
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,250
Okay.

59
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,544
So?

60
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,596
Laurel just walked into
police headquarters.

61
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,423
- What, to surrender?
- Not exactly.

62
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,300
She told them she's Laurel Lance.

63
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,428
Our Laurel Lance.

64
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,057
Okay, why is she claiming
to be Laurel Lance?

65
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,064
Well, Dinah is out for blood
and Laurel Lance, public figure,

66
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,363
is a much more difficult target
than Black Siren.

67
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,235
Except it's a lie.

68
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,068
It's all one big lie.

69
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,620
Well, we need to get to her
before she gets to the press.

70
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,492
I woke up in a cell

71
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,454
and I managed to break down the door,

72
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,585
and I just... I ran.

73
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,083
They held you for two years?

74
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,539
I don't remember.

75
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,000
<i>They kept me drugged.</i>

76
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,928
<i>The Black Canary was
reported dead, killed in a prison riot.</i>

77
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,504
<i>Damien Darhk, he stabbed me.</i>

78
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,298
<i>And then next thing I knew, I was...</i>

79
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,549
<i>I was in that cell.</i>

80
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,601
I don't know how,
but this is really, really bad.

81
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,099
Rather, we should have
seen this coming.

82
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,179
Should've known
that she'd eventually

83
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,559
try to pull something like this.

84
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,107
Why would Damien Darhk
do this to you?

85
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,434
<i>Why would
he fake your death?</i>

86
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,895
I don't know why
he would wanna fake my death.

87
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,398
Maybe... Maybe to torture
the Green Arrow?

88
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,654
So you know who the Green Arrow is?

89
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,736
Ollie! Ollie!

90
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,907
I never thought I'd see you again.

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,869
Daddy.

92
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,122
Daddy.

93
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,839
- Daddy.
- Can you tell us any more

94
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,087
information on...

95
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,710
You notably
outed Miss. Lance

96
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,420
as the Black Canary at her funeral.

97
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,880
And now it seems
a little suspicious

98
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,341
in light of the recent allegations
that you are the Green Arrow.

99
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,183
It doesn't and it's not.

100
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,979
I have made no secret of the fact
that when necessary,

101
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,558
I have been in contact
with Green Arrow and his team.

102
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,936
He told me about Laurel Lance.

103
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,315
I wasn't talking to myself.

104
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,567
Is that true, Miss Lance?

105
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,864
Miss Lance, is Oliver Queen
the Green Arrow?

106
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,656
I really do think that Miss Lance

107
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,492
could use some time with her family
and some privacy.

108
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:13,993
Let's go.

109
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,599
- What do you think you're doing?
- What?

110
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,726
You said you wanted me
to be more like Laurel,

111
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,977
so I thought I'd give it a try.

112
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,024
Oh, I really wish I'd believe that.

113
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,023
Where's the money
you stole from the city?

114
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,729
Yeah...

115
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,780
About that, slight hiccup.

116
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,359
So, I went to where I stashed it,

117
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,236
and it's been cleaned out.

118
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,492
It's gone. Poof.

119
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,073
So, without the money you, what,

120
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,166
decided to become Laurel Lance,

121
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,915
'cause she's a public figure
and harder to kill?

122
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,666
You're really that afraid
of Dinah Drake, aren't you?

123
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,125
Not just afraid of Dinah.

124
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,382
Afraid of whoever manipulated
Cayden James

125
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,758
into thinking I killed his son.

126
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,181
'Cause that's probably
who killed James, too.

127
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,426
Who did it? Anatoly?

128
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,635
Or Diaz?

129
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,011
Or you?

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,727
I mean, she could've
just easily killed both of them.

131
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,315
I don't exactly have
an airtight alibi for Cayden.

132
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,114
I believe his son was killed
when I was incarcerated at A.R.G.U.S.

133
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,399
Who did it?

134
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,656
Anatoly or Diaz?

135
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,658
Talking out of school
will get me in trouble.

136
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,708
Look, whoever went after James
is clearly coming for you next.

137
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,584
So, why don't you cooperate with us?

138
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,124
Help us find the money,

139
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,917
and maybe we can just protect you.

140
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,794
Little trivia.

141
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,637
There's a Thea Queen on the Earth
that I come from, too.

142
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,215
Only she's not
as pathetically naive as you.

143
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,425
Look.

144
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,187
This is a lot simpler
than you're making it.

145
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,144
You're gonna protect me
and you're going to help protect me

146
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,353
by going along with the story
that I'm the real Laurel Lance.

147
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,436
Yeah?

148
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,114
Why would we do that?

149
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,441
I don't know.

150
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,449
Maybe because of all the reporters
that are just in the next room.

151
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,164
You know, it's only a matter of time
before they ask me

152
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,033
who the Green Arrow is again.

153
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,836
What would you like me to tell them?

154
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,174
We're done here.

155
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,806
Mr. Mayor, may I speak to you
for a minute?

156
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,969
Yes.

157
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,851
- What's all the fuss?
- Laurel Lance just turned up alive.

158
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,357
- Believe it or not, she's actually...
- I know who she is.

159
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,277
Sorry to pull you away,
but payday is Friday.

160
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,233
And my officers
aren't gonna get their checks.

161
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,444
Captain Hill, I'm still working

162
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,903
on recovering the money
that was extorted.

163
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,535
And I have an idea to buy us time
that I wanted to run past you.

164
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,661
Let's hear it.

165
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,084
The department has
years of seized assets.

166
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,661
Sports cars, mansions,

167
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,667
even a stuffed polar bear,
if you can believe it.

168
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,006
- Mmm-hmm.
- At least two-thirds of the property

169
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,833
has cleared the court process
for sale.

170
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,342
If we auction it off,
we can raise as much as $30 million.

171
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,421
Thirty?

172
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,178
Set that in motion.

173
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,301
Thank you.

174
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,268
- Hello.
- Don't talk to me.

175
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,645
Captain Hill,
can I talk to you for a minute?

176
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,852
- It's about Laurel Lance.
- That's a hell of a thing, isn't it?

177
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,153
She said they faked her death

178
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,321
and then she was
held captive for two years.

179
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,943
Yeah, sure is.

180
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,984
Anyone catch that case yet?

181
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,489
You want it? It's yours.

182
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,033
But right now she's going
to the hospital for a GSW.

183
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,322
I'm patient.

184
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,549
- C-Dog.
- Hey, Zoe.

185
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,218
Great. Love that that name's
sticking around. That's amazing.

186
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,259
The babysitter had to go home
two hours ago.

187
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,422
Where's my dad?

188
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,223
Have a seat.

189
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,890
Something happened.

190
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,855
He's gonna be okay,

191
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,648
but I need to tell you about it.

192
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,270
This is inappropriate.

193
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,731
My motion should be heard
in open court.

194
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,316
I requested to be heard in chambers.

195
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,034
Oh, to what, hide the embarrassment
of having your case dismissed?

196
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,534
Actually we're taking Mr. Ramirez
off our witness list.

197
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,491
Considering he was your sole witness
against Mr. Queen,

198
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,122
- I renew my motion to have...
- He's not our sole witness.

199
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,755
What? No, no, no, no.
Discovery on this case is closed.

200
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,298
This is newly discovered information,
Your Honor.

201
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,592
We'll make the witness' proffer
available to the defense,

202
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,010
in accordance with <i>Brady v. Marilyn.</i>

203
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,212
Who is the witness?

204
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,342
Someone with enemies
on both sides of the law.

205
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,140
That's why we're doing this
in chambers

206
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,350
and why I granted
the district attorney's request

207
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,473
for a suppression order.

208
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,852
All right, I get it, it's sensitive.
What is the witness' name?

209
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,932
Roy Harper.

210
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,026
How did they even find Roy?

211
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,486
I mean, we didn't know where he was.

212
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,037
We didn't even know
what name he was working under.

213
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,409
I didn't think anybody did.

214
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,953
- Did you?
- No. No...

215
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,661
God, I couldn't even find him
for your guys' wedding reception.

216
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,542
It doesn't matter how they did it.
They did.

217
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,917
Now we have to figure out
what to do next.

218
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,715
He's definitely not
cooperating voluntarily.

219
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,921
Well, it's been two years.

220
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,718
I mean, there might be some
pressure points we don't know about,

221
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,215
some people he cares about, some...

222
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,222
- It's been a long time.
- Either way,

223
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,471
we need to know
what Roy is going to say in court,

224
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,304
which means we need to know
where he is right now.

225
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,558
Oliver, he's a state witness.

226
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,723
I know our whole thing is extralegal,

227
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,979
but maybe we should let
your lawyer deal with this.

228
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,608
The DA's office does not have
the capabilities of finding Roy.

229
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,065
Which means,
this was either Diaz or Anatoly.

230
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,650
You think whoever's
pulling the strings on this

231
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,734
is still tugging them?

232
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,990
Well, if you're in the mood
for some witness tampering,

233
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,038
I think I have a line
on where the DA is holding Roy.

234
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,457
They rented out several rooms in
the top floor of a hotel downtown.

235
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,830
Hotel. Easily guarded position
with lots of civilians,

236
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,834
we break in, get spotted, Oliver,
we make their case for them.

237
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,713
Guys, if Ollie is right, and Roy
is in trouble with Diaz or Anatoly,

238
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,669
we need to be protecting him.

239
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,510
So we wait until dark to do recon.

240
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,934
And then find
possible points of entry.

241
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,397
No exertion or sudden movements.

242
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,849
Don't wanna risk reopening the wound.

243
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,442
Hey, could you...
Could you give us a minute please?

244
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,818
What, is Mom coming
to visit or something?

245
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,324
Okay, firstly,
she's not your mom.

246
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,659
And second, no.

247
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,866
I called her right after your
little performance for the cameras

248
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,952
and told her to hold off a bit
while I checked you out.

249
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,287
That poor woman has been burned
enough by this sort of thing.

250
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,048
More of Laurel's stuff.

251
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,839
You know, I was just getting used
to the last outfit.

252
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,386
Well, Forensics has that one.

253
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,556
Anyway, you wanna pass
for the real Laurel,

254
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,433
you better get used to her style.

255
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,886
You call this "style"?

256
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,523
Look, are you here just to make sure
my health insurance is up to date

257
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,349
or are you here
to protect me from her?

258
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,400
Just get dressed.

259
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,320
Hey.

260
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,625
Laurel Lance,
she died in this hospital.

261
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,747
I pronounced her.

262
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,119
There was an autopsy.

263
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,963
Of course, I've seen
my share of things

264
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,211
I once would've
considered miraculous.

265
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,795
I mean, in a world where a man
can run faster than light,

266
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,425
I suppose anything's possible.

267
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,097
That's why I need
to rule out the chance

268
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,595
that this person
could be an impostor.

269
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,142
The DNA test will tell us that.

270
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,012
Excuse me.

271
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,185
- Hey.
- Hey.

272
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,069
Look, I know what you're
doing here, all right?

273
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,021
You're going after Laurel 'cause
of what happened to your friend,

274
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,196
and I get that, okay?

275
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,401
It's what I would do
if someone I love was dead.

276
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,577
You mean it's just what you do
with a criminal, Quentin,

277
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,199
which, by the way, is what she is.

278
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,952
Yeah, but you and I both know that,

279
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,910
but, you know, she's turned herself
into a beloved public figure.

280
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,710
She's also said that she's got
no compunctions about outing Oliver.

281
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,834
I don't think
she'll stop with him.

282
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,046
- So you're doing this for my sake?
- For all of our sakes.

283
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,431
I've been making progress
with her, Dinah.

284
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,266
Okay? I'm not finished.

285
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,472
But if she lives as my Laurel...

286
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,100
She's not your Laurel.

287
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,854
Your Laurel wouldn't have murdered
Vince or anyone else.

288
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,191
She did.

289
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,021
And you are delusional
if you think you can change her.

290
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,107
No. I'm telling you,
I've been changing her, okay?

291
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,569
All I'm asking for you
is just a chance. Please?

292
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,781
What's taking her so long?

293
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,711
- Where'd she go?
- The police officer took her.

294
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,417
Said something about a safe house.

295
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,468
No, no. I am the lead detective
on this case.

296
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,056
- You did this.
- What are you talking about?

297
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,887
I wanna know where she is, too,
you know.

298
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,981
Is my father not coming?

299
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,408
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Mr. Diaz.

300
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,629
I'm guessing Roy's in the room
with the police outside?

301
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,972
Yeah. Eating the wrong end
of a phone book.

302
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,716
It's risky terrain.

303
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,392
You just told me
he's getting beaten on.

304
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,511
You're still not sure
we should do this?

305
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,305
Two-man team on the balcony.

306
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,390
If we can get past them,
that's our best bet.

307
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,816
John, he's in there 'cause of me.

308
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,727
He's been on the run for three years.

309
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,028
Oliver, that's his choice.

310
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,614
I know that,
but did I learn anything from it?

311
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,324
Roy put on the hood.

312
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,657
He sacrificed himself for me.

313
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,405
And I asked you to do the same thing,

314
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,206
at the expense of your safety
and your family.

315
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,956
Difference was,
I wanted to put on the hood.

316
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,539
Oliver, listen, I've been good
for the past two months, good.

317
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,173
But instead of
giving me back the hood,

318
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,716
you've had Cisco make me a new suit.

319
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,885
There it is.
It's a 15-second opening.

320
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,091
That is our window.

321
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,152
We got it from here.

322
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,571
Head back to SCPD
before you're missed.

323
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,277
Laurel.

324
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,995
Is it Laurel or "Laurel" these days?

325
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,455
So confusing,
this doppelganger business.

326
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,666
But you seem
to have figured it out.

327
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,209
Diaz killed Cayden.

328
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,745
He told me.

329
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,171
No honor among thieves.

330
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,957
Or crime lords, I guess.

331
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,754
Well...

332
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,171
Diaz manipulated the both of us,
lied to the both of us.

333
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,971
This whole time,
he's had his own agenda.

334
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,048
That doesn't bother you?

335
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,679
I'm not sentimental.

336
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,681
I am Russian.

337
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,351
I'm in the city for two reasons only.

338
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,981
One is revenge against Oliver Queen,

339
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,902
and two is money.

340
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,065
I'm happy to work
with whoever can get me either.

341
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,991
You're in the city
because the Bratva cast you out.

342
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,444
Well, there's that, too.

343
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,333
There is a 15-second window

344
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,252
where neither roof guard
is watching the HVAC vent.

345
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,328
We can get in that way.

346
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,210
All right, well, did you see him,
is he okay?

347
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,880
- We can get him out.
- I know. And I'm coming with you.

348
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,257
I thought you didn't do this anymore.

349
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,468
Ollie, it's Roy.

350
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,140
Right, but, Thea,
you shouldn't do this.

351
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,517
And I understand it's hypocritical
pointing out

352
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,560
that you have a personal involvement.

353
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,808
Doesn't make me wrong.

354
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,684
More importantly,
you have not been field-ready

355
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,063
since you got out of your coma.

356
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,941
I'll be fine. Okay?

357
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,938
And did you guys
even measure the vents?

358
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,193
Because you should be asking

359
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,946
if I'm the right size
to fit through them.

360
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,276
Don't think either of you two can.

361
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,452
Where are you guys keeping my suit?

362
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,824
You okay?

363
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,409
It's just like riding a bike.

364
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,244
It really isn't.

365
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,663
I can buy you a few extra seconds.

366
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,707
I'm ready.

367
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,083
All right.

368
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,507
What's that for?

369
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,430
There's not a home game tonight,
is there?

370
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,368
You wanna keep going,

371
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,295
or are you gonna testify?

372
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,665
I'm not a lawyer,

373
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,716
but I'm pretty sure
torturing your witness

374
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,213
isn't gonna be great for your case.

375
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,554
You don't think we know how to
put you in a world of hurt

376
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,340
without leaving a mark?

377
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,054
No.

378
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,197
Are you getting this?

379
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,407
I'm enhancing their badge numbers.

380
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,985
And just when you thought
Oliver took down

381
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,320
all the crooked cops last year.

382
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:20,904
I'm going in.

383
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,785
<i>I wouldn't.
They got six more guys in the hall.</i>

384
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,911
Stand down.

385
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,867
I know it's hard,
but you have to wait.

386
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,711
I'm working up an appetite here.

387
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,168
Hey.

388
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,345
We're gonna get some
Big Belly Burger.

389
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,010
You decide to play nice,
I might give you the fries.

390
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,647
Is that my hood?

391
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,066
It looks good on you.

392
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,998
I'm sorry if you're seeing someone.

393
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,579
I'm not. I didn't take your advice.

394
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,836
No kids, no wife,
and I really, really hate minivans.

395
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,297
How did they find you?

396
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,471
I was in St. Roch

397
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,423
and the Star City cops,
they tased me,

398
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,803
and they threw me
in the back of a van.

399
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,763
They knew everything,
they knew about Oliver,

400
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,016
they knew about me faking my death,
they knew it all.

401
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,597
SCPD SWAT incoming.

402
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,107
Speedy, you wanna
get out of there now.

403
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,354
Speedy, move.

404
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,154
Okay, we're leaving.

405
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,815
No, you're leaving.

406
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,524
I'm in no shape to be swinging
from the rooftops.

407
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,235
I'm not leaving without you.

408
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,745
- They're coming in hot.
- You gotta go right now.

409
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,289
Damn it, Speedy, get out of there!

410
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,365
I'm getting you out of here.

411
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,918
- No, you can't. You have to go.
- No.

412
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,168
I'm not leaving you.

413
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,837
<i>Speedy, they're right
outside the door!</i>

414
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,049
I'm not losing you again.

415
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,335
Just go sit.

416
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,590
Thea.

417
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,807
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

418
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,016
I needed some air.

419
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,185
You're gonna need air.

420
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,399
- What the hell did you just do?
- I just saved your life.

421
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,110
There's too many of them in there.
They would have killed you both.

422
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,486
Look...

423
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,326
We will get Roy back.

424
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,040
I am promising you,

425
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,826
we will get him back.

426
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,470
They're really
circling the wagons now.

427
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,092
They've upped security tenfold.

428
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,469
He was bleeding internally,

429
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,642
so if we don't get to him soon,
they're going to kill him.

430
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,017
They will not, because they need him
alive to testify against me.

431
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,598
Not "they." Diaz.

432
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,308
I pulled financials
on both the police officers

433
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,392
that were torturing Roy.

434
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,443
They both receive generous
dividend payments

435
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,863
from stocks of a Corto Maltese-based
shell corporation.

436
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,656
They financed the company
that was manufacturing

437
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,404
the drug I used to treat my injury.

438
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,944
Ricardo Diaz's company.

439
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,995
Both officers were on duty
when Cayden James was killed,

440
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,323
and all the officers
that were there tonight,

441
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,124
we have reason to believe
they're working with Diaz, too.

442
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,959
So Diaz has been playing us
since the beginning.

443
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,833
Or he's just been playing you.

444
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,258
She's upset. She's worried about Roy.

445
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:24,671
Yeah, so am I.

446
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,599
- I had to pull you out of there.
- No, you could've come in.

447
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,351
I come in there, and it's you and me

448
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,603
against a SWAT team,
in a tight space,

449
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,150
nobody comes out of there.

450
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,856
Especially not Roy.

451
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,439
You know, there are times

452
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,074
when I feel like my life
completely fell apart when Roy left.

453
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,499
From my bloodlust, to Malcolm,
to the coma...

454
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,378
Knowing he was out there,
that he was okay,

455
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,587
it made my life
just a little bit easier.

456
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,428
Ever since Mom died,
I haven't known much of anything

457
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,426
other than the fact
that I want to make sure he is safe.

458
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,224
And I will do whatever it takes
to make sure that happens.

459
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,722
We all will, Speedy.

460
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,182
Felicity may have just
found something.

461
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,186
SCPD just requisitioned
a transport prisoner van.

462
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,858
They're moving Roy
to a new safe house.

463
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,934
We just don't know when.

464
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,065
That's it.

465
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,317
That's when we get him.

466
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,899
There's something else.

467
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,489
No, no, no, no, okay.

468
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,662
You know what, who can tell me
where Laurel Lance is?

469
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,738
Can you tell me that?

470
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,249
And when will he be available?

471
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,003
No, no, no, no. No, thank you.
I'll call back.

472
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,580
I swear, this isn't me, okay?

473
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,416
I need to speak with you.

474
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,793
You too.

475
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,851
Turn the cameras off.

476
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,106
Cayden James was murdered
right there.

477
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,991
By Ricardo Diaz.

478
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,946
- Oh, my God.
- And it was covered up by the SCPD.

479
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,328
I thought Cayden James
was killed by another inmate

480
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,079
when he was transferred
to Iron Heights.

481
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,876
Felicity found out
what actually happened.

482
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,291
Never made it to Iron Heights.

483
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,462
The cops on duty
are on Diaz's payroll.

484
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,338
They faked the transfer.

485
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,509
Doing that would take...

486
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,680
A systemic breach
of the police department.

487
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,883
Worse than last year's corruption.

488
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,468
I didn't think
that was even possible.

489
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,723
Neither did I.

490
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,355
Dinah, I know that
you don't believe in me right now,

491
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,649
and I know the two of you
don't trust each other,

492
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,725
for good reason,

493
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,488
but the both of you
believe in the badge.

494
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,321
I need you working together,
I need to know how deep this goes.

495
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,995
I need to know who in that room
we can trust.

496
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,910
Which means you gotta
put your vendetta on hold.

497
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,415
Okay.

498
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,167
We can work it out at my place.

499
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,623
The walls here have got ears.

500
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,550
And this is why
I couldn't find Laurel.

501
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,381
'Cause those bent cops sprung her.

502
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,212
Or they took her someplace worse.

503
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,764
Diaz's feelings were so hurt
when you tried to run.

504
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,805
It's as if you don't trust him
or something.

505
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,936
I'm still trying to figure out
why you do.

506
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,359
For me, it's more a matter
of money than trust.

507
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,395
Either way, Diaz better.

508
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,444
Why blow up city
when you can control it, yes?

509
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,726
You're as good as they said you were.

510
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,609
Do you know
that fighting for trophies

511
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,778
is not the same
as fighting for your life?

512
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,990
Break you of your bad habits.

513
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,863
Welcome to the team.

514
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,868
That's a lot of money
for a man with bad foot.

515
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:27,001
I didn't break it,
I just had to break him.

516
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,596
Building a family, Anatoly.

517
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,799
Family.

518
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,474
Isn't that what "Bratva" means?

519
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,429
- "Brotherhood"?
<i>- Da.</i>

520
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,732
See, family,

521
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,189
they rely on one another.

522
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,443
Family trust each other.

523
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:57,702
See, when a family does well,
each member prospers.

524
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,580
But if just one person

525
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,584
betrays their family...

526
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,751
Give us the room!

527
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,915
Move!

528
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,513
The money that you stole from Cayden

529
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,436
was also my money.

530
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,474
I earned it, just like you.

531
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,977
Except I didn't take
more than my share.

532
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,941
Well, you've got it all back,
obviously.

533
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,442
So why am I here?

534
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,615
It's 'cause our business
is not concluded.

535
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,535
You might have convinced Anatoly that
you're worth staying in bed with,

536
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,112
but I have a psycho vigilante
coming after me.

537
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,538
Dinah Drake.

538
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,615
Mmm?

539
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,038
I see it all.

540
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,879
I know it all. I control it all.

541
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,211
I've been working on this for months.

542
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,636
See, Cayden, he's just a small piece
of a much larger puzzle.

543
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,840
And so are you.

544
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,424
I just wanna
get the hell out of this city.

545
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,759
Where you wanna go?

546
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,969
Hmm?

547
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,771
- Do what?
- Live.

548
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,601
Without always having to look
over my shoulder.

549
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,318
I don't want you
to worry about Dinah Drake.

550
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,484
I don't want you
to worry about Oliver Queen

551
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,319
or any of those chumps

552
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,406
who can't see two inches
past their face.

553
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:29,252
Anatoly said that you had a plan
to take control of the city.

554
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,584
Now, isn't that something...

555
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,839
Worth staying in bed for?

556
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,971
I don't know, Felicity.

557
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,473
Maybe it's a little soon, bringing up
taking back the mantle from Oliver,

558
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,727
but it's been two months.

559
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,400
A hell of a two months, though.

560
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,394
And Oliver's not just ready
to step down,

561
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,445
not with everything that's going on.
It's too much.

562
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,439
It's crazy what's...

563
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,318
They're moving Roy in 10 minutes.

564
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,123
Don't move.

565
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,005
Roy, back away from the door.

566
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,097
It's a decoy.

567
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,846
They faked Cayden James' transfer,
they faked this one, too.

568
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,515
So where is Roy?

569
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,488
Mr. Harper. Good to meet you.

570
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,283
You said they were moving him.

571
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,959
Yeah, they must have put Roy
into a different vehicle

572
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,786
when they were in the underground
and I didn't have eyes on them.

573
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,130
Which means he could have been
picked up at any point last night.

574
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,752
How many cars left the hotel
in that time frame?

575
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:58,959
Nearly 300.

576
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,544
I'm tracking license-plate numbers,
but it's gonna take some time.

577
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,221
If it takes more than an hour,
I'm gonna start breaking fingers.

578
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,216
There's that Queen temper.

579
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,269
I'll contact Lyla, see if A.R.G.U.S.
can help with finding Roy.

580
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,975
How are you holding up?

581
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,060
- I've been better.
- Yeah, I know.

582
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,441
It's because you're blaming yourself
for Roy's situation

583
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,773
instead of accurately blaming
Ricardo Diaz.

584
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,779
Well, Roy wouldn't be
in this situation

585
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,407
if he didn't fall on his sword
for me three years ago.

586
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,158
That was his choice, Oliver.

587
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,661
And I believed then and
I still believe it was the right one.

588
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,040
I'm worried that I didn't
rescue him from that hotel room

589
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,245
'cause I wouldn't have been able

590
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,205
to bear the responsibility
if things went bad.

591
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,957
You didn't go into that hotel room

592
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,759
because your gut told you
things would go bad.

593
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,386
And that gut's kept you alive
for 11 years

594
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,804
and it kept Roy alive last night.

595
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,756
Maybe. How do I know?

596
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,388
I could ask Cisco
to find a parallel universe

597
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,468
in which you did.

598
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,269
But in the meantime
if you could just stop

599
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:56,270
finding ways to blame yourself,
that would be so great.

600
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,236
- Is that what I'm doing?
- That's what you're always doing.

601
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,813
Maybe you have a point.

602
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,774
Last night, John basically asked me

603
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,860
why I haven't given him
the hood back.

604
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,156
Yeah, I know, he told me.

605
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,409
I told him you probably just thought
it wasn't the right time.

606
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,081
Am I on the money?

607
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,451
I don't know.

608
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,258
You have a strength
one doesn't see much.

609
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,881
You wanna join my team?

610
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,307
Sure.

611
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,095
Do you offer medical and dental?

612
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,185
You know, my police friends are
telling me you're not cooperating.

613
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,979
You're not playing ball.

614
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,276
You won't testify against Queen?

615
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,070
If you actually think
that I would do that,

616
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,609
then you're an idiot.

617
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,108
One of us is.

618
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,741
See, but I'm not the type of guy
that believes giving a beating

619
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,994
is the only way

620
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:56,952
to cause some pain.

621
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,382
How's Speedy?

622
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,966
She came out of retirement.

623
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,968
Why would she do that?

624
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,265
Why the hell would Queen
let his baby sister

625
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,850
dress up like Will Scarlet?

626
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,769
All right, I gotta ask.

627
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,564
That's a moot point.

628
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,316
You see, the real question is,

629
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,747
who do I gotta bring the pain to?

630
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,000
Do I gotta bring it to you?

631
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,876
Or her?

632
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,015
Shift sergeant was definitely
in on it. Look at this.

633
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,177
Diaz has got
his fingers in deep.

634
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,179
Listen.

635
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,980
Thanks for doing this, all right?

636
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,687
- Backing off Laurel.
- It's temporary.

637
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,895
Until we can get the department
back under control.

638
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,651
Hi, Daddy.

639
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,995
- Hi.
- Speak of the devil.

640
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,873
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

641
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,162
I've got a lot I'd like to say.

642
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,414
Can we not do the whole
screaming thing,

643
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,712
because the only thing
that's gonna happen

644
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,755
is my father's gonna have to
renovate his apartment.

645
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,047
Plus,

646
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,633
I'm here about Ricardo Diaz.

647
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,553
I would ask how you're doing, but...

648
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,854
Felicity and A.R.G.U.S.
are working on locating Roy.

649
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,768
You know, it's been a while
since I offered you

650
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,694
a little big-brother advice.

651
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,405
Do you mind?

652
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,535
This should be good.

653
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,160
When we find Roy... Not if, but when

654
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,750
we find Roy,

655
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,087
I think maybe you should go with him.

656
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,380
- Where?
- Wherever he's going.

657
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:15,264
I mean, Thea, I'd miss you like crazy

658
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,764
but you said that you haven't
been the same without him.

659
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,350
So maybe you shouldn't be
without him.

660
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,566
- You really think I should go?
- I don't want you to go, obviously.

661
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:31,273
But you've seen what... What having
Felicity in my life has done for me.

662
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,988
You deserve that same
kind of happiness, Speedy.

663
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,532
Wherever it is.

664
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,205
Got news.

665
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,203
- Location on Roy?
- Laurel.

666
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,287
She showed up at Lance's apartment
with intel on Ricardo Diaz.

667
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,547
He has some plan
to take over the city,

668
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,258
whatever that means.
I don't exactly have details.

669
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,561
No, he just let you leave
after you stole all that money.

670
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,474
Let you come over here
and tell us all of this.

671
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,981
Well, I'm rather charming.
Don't you think?

672
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,687
So where's Roy?

673
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,190
They had him brought
to some rundown casino.

674
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,401
I heard some guys talking about it
on my way out.

675
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,158
- I can take you there.
- So Diaz can take these guys out?

676
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,746
Is that part of the plan?

677
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,698
Look, we really don't
have a choice, okay?

678
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,078
We need to take this chance.

679
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,660
All right, why are you doing this?

680
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,378
Going against Diaz?

681
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:31,083
Because it occurred to me
that if I'm gonna be Laurel,

682
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,550
I should probably
start acting like it.

683
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,682
Yeah, John.
We have a location on Roy.

684
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,058
Let's get ready to move.

685
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,689
All right, fine.

686
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,941
- Just this once.
- No.

687
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,069
You don't trust me.
I don't trust you.

688
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,488
So I'd rather
be in the field shorthanded.

689
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,087
Only two guards.

690
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,044
Diaz clearly wasn't expecting us.

691
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,544
Black Siren didn't warn him.

692
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,834
- Let's go.
- Wait.

693
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,965
If we go in there without
knowing our primary objective,

694
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,091
no one is coming out.

695
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,093
Our primary objective is to get Roy.

696
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,674
What about Diaz? He's in there, too.

697
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,101
And we just found out that he's
the one that's behind everything bad

698
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,520
that's been happening in the city
for the past six months.

699
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,981
So let's get 'em both.

700
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,820
- Overwatch, you in yet?
<i>- Uplinking now.</i>

701
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,693
<i>Huffing and puffing and blowing
all those firewalls down,</i>

702
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,773
<i>but before I finish,</i>

703
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,405
if he's a smart guy,
and we know that he is,

704
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,487
this will definitely tip him off
that you're there.

705
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,447
- We need to know where Roy is.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

706
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,081
I pulled the blueprints of the casino
from the city.

707
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,157
I'll guide you through.

708
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,538
<i>Head up the escalator.</i>

709
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:56,175
Three vigilantes, including your
red girlfriend just showed up.

710
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,048
It's time for a change of scenery.

711
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,424
You know what to do.

712
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,140
Four hostiles with full autos
right in front of you.

713
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,494
- Which way?
- According to thermals,

714
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,080
Diaz has Roy
through the door on the north wall.

715
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,421
Unit 545 requesting backup.
Shots fired.

716
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,055
Arrows.

717
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,841
Make that, "Arrows fired."

718
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,055
Get away from him!

719
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,688
On the ground. Now!

720
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,732
I love it when you visit me,
Mr. Mayor.

721
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,692
I love it even more when you leave.

722
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,112
No kill shots. I need him alive.

723
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,502
Speedy! No!

724
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,306
Ahh!

725
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,664
We have a problem.

726
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,125
One of Diaz's cops
alerted the legitimate cavalry.

727
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,926
The SCPD is headed your way en masse.

728
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,398
So you're just a hired hand?

729
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,365
I used to be Pakhan.

730
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,030
You cost me that.

731
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,282
I've got him. Go help Speedy.

732
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,371
Ugh!

733
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,178
You okay?

734
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,174
Don't move.

735
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,806
Not all those guys are on my payroll.

736
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,428
Yet.

737
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,601
But even the ones who aren't,

738
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:01,186
they find the anti-vigilante bill
very motivating.

739
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,394
Speedy.

740
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,778
Get in the van

741
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,902
and drive Roy away.

742
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,109
- What about Diaz?
- I got Diaz.

743
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,658
No, you don't.

744
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,410
You know that, right?

745
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,416
If you stay here,

746
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,498
you're gonna get yourself a collar.

747
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,419
And it's not like you can
just take me away with you, right?

748
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,258
But you already knew that.

749
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,669
That's why you let your sister
drive off.

750
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,588
You made your choice.

751
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,675
Freeze!

752
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,157
How do you feel?

753
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,194
Like I've been beaten within an inch
of my life with a telephone book.

754
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,823
Two broken ribs
and a bruised lung.

755
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,405
Gotta take it easy
for a few days, Roy.

756
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,411
Well, that's the good part
about being a fugitive.

757
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,284
There's nowhere else I have to be.

758
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,495
How's Anatoly?

759
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,459
SCPD. I had to bail. What about Diaz?

760
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:06,917
Same.

761
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,548
How are Quentin and Dinah doing

762
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,176
with their investigation
into the SCPD?

763
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,256
They're working on it.

764
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,762
I'm not a lawyer,
but what are the effects of us

765
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,470
having the government's star witness
in our protection instead of theirs?

766
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,226
Not as much as you would think.

767
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:23,268
They'll add witness tampering
and obstruction to their

768
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,897
very long list of charges.

769
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,395
Cherry on top.

770
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,819
We did it all for Thea.

771
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,952
And for Roy.

772
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,577
I would have done it
for any of you guys.

773
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,881
My father's asleep.

774
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:51,671
I came to see you.

775
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,599
Okay.

776
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,485
You didn't set us up.

777
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,655
Gee, Ollie, you sound surprised.

778
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,949
So I came by to say thank you.

779
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,113
And yet still unconvinced.

780
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,739
You're not Laurel.

781
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:17,996
Not our Laurel.

782
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,783
And saying that you are
to a bunch of press...

783
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,587
No. That does not make it so.

784
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,673
You're right. I'm not.

785
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,048
But I'm willing to try.

786
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,722
And I can't make any promises.
I am who I am,

787
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,678
but I'm willing to try if you're
willing to give me the space to.

788
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,308
Well, that sounds fair.

789
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,811
You're staying here?

790
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,359
Quentin, he...

791
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,736
My father offered me his couch.

792
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,324
It's pretty on point with the whole
"rescue Laurel Lance" story, so...

793
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,400
Yeah.

794
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,154
I'll be checking in.

795
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,995
Looking forward to it.

796
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,507
Home sweet home.

797
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,092
Nice.

798
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,304
For the past three years, I've been
sleeping with the cockroaches.

799
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,109
I feel like
I should have been there with you.

800
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,112
Is that too presumptuous
or confusing?

801
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,905
I know that last time
we saw each other

802
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,153
I said that
we should probably see...

803
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:53,338
Master. I've located
the heir of Ra's al Ghul.
