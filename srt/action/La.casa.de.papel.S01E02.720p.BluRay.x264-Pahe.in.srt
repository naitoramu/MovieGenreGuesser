THE FACTS AND SCENARIOS REPRESENTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,881
I'm looking for people
who do not have much to lose.

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:10,681
You do not know each other
and I want it to remain that way.

4
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:13,281
I do not want any names,
no personal questions

5
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:16,201
nor, of course,
personal relationships.

6
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:19,481
Tomorrow is the robbery,
that's why I want to give you something.

7
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,801
Now you at least
know my real name.

8
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,241
- Profesor.
- Miss Tokio?

9
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,361
What are we going to steal?

10
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:26,321
The Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

11
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:31,561
The little lamb is coming in.

12
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:34,441
I tell you I'm pregnant,
and you just keep calm?

13
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,401
What shall I do, call my wife,
tell her to pick up the children

14
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,681
and we all go to celebrate?

15
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,401
- Now!
- Don't move!

16
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:48,721
Let's go!

17
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,281
I can't find the girl.
I can't fucking see her.

18
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,161
Let's take a picture with your phone.

19
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,881
With this photo you'll be
all the rage on the Internet.

20
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:07,201
I'm the person who's in charge.
But you're here as hostages.

21
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,641
I guarantee you'll be left alive.

22
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,721
12 years of my life
in and out of prison.

23
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,161
Do you know why?

24
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,081
Because I'm not very smart,
son, but in this hit

25
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:19,481
it's another one who puts the brains.

26
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:22,041
But be very careful,
because by the time there's

27
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,721
a single drop of blood,
we'll stop being Robin Hoods

28
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,801
to become
into a bunch of motherfuckers.

29
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,241
- 30 seconds.
- 30 seconds.

30
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,281
<i>- Two police wounded.</i>
Who fired?

31
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,521
Tokio, apparently has
a relationship.

32
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,841
The last thing I think about
is to have a relationship

33
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,441
with a kid. Things don't always
come out as planned.

34
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,841
- What happened?
- 35 workers,

35
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,401
11 security guards
and 17 students from the British College.

36
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:56,761
It's essential that the police
have no idea

37
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:58,121
of what we are doing.

38
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,121
<i>I'm Raquel Murillo,
inspector in command,</i>

39
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:02,441
- What do you want?
- Time.

40
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:08,401
- What are those armored cars doing here?
- We're going in, with everything.

41
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,521
They'll come in because we've got
our little lamb, Alison Parker.

42
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,801
The time has come
to follow my orders!

43
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:17,441
There's a person in there
of priority one.

44
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:20,401
My name is Alison Parker,
daughter of the UK ambassador.

45
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,921
I'm calling you
from inside the factory,

46
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,241
we've been dressed
as the kidnappers.

47
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:28,481
What's that?

48
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:31,121
It's impossible to know
who they're going to shoot.

49
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,001
- Don't get in, for God's sake.
- Stop it.

50
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:34,321
Abort the operation.

51
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:39,161
Finish what you have started,
I don't want anything to do with it.

52
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:42,241
Y 20 minutes later,
the best paid job

53
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:44,761
of history.
Everything depended on time

54
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,361
that we could hold in.

55
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:01,001
Can I have a decaf, please?

56
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,841
<i>Hello, this is
Mariví's answering machine.</i>

57
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:11,241
<i>When you hear the beep,
you can leave a message.</i>

58
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,081
Mum, I've just finished. It's...

59
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,441
Excuse me, do you have a phone charger?

60
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:23,041
No.

61
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,521
Do you want to use mine?

62
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,641
20 HOURS OF ROBBERY

63
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,041
- Really? Don't you mind?
- No, no.

64
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,081
Are you sure? Thanks.

65
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,281
I have to make a couple of calls.

66
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,721
- It's all right.
- Thanks a lot.

67
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,681
SATURDAY 6:25 AM

68
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,241
Mum, I've just finished, I'm on my way.

69
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,121
<i>Superintendent Sánchez,
leave your message.</i>

70
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,201
This is inspector Murillo.
I know it's late,

71
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:11,401
but I wanted to tell that,
if Intelligence is in charge,

72
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:13,841
due to I don't know
which type of diplomatic interests,

73
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:17,081
I'm not gonna be your straw inspector.
while those gorillas

74
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:20,841
enter there with everything.
I would love to be more flexible

75
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,401
and put my panties down
every time that Prieto squawks,

76
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,561
but I don't have the guts
so I see myself in the obligation...

77
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:30,161
to resign. Good night.

78
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,801
Good morning.

79
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,521
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

80
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,481
Excuse me, but you're...

81
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:55,881
It's you...

82
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,841
<i>I started telling
the story of a kidnapping,</i>

83
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,281
<i>because everybody will remember
those days of siege</i>

84
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:03,361
<i>in the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.</i>

85
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:07,161
<i>The streets downtown were closed,
the TV made live broadcasts the 24 hours,</i>

86
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:09,361
<i>the police burnt their academy manuals</i>

87
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,721
<i>and they didn't know
how to eat that pie in the sky</i>

88
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:14,041
<i>of those poor wretches trying to print
their own money,</i>

89
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,041
<i>but many other things happened
and nobody remembers them,</i>

90
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,481
<i>things that changed us all</i>

91
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:22,041
<i>to the point of not knowing
who the bad guys were...</i>

92
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,121
<i>and who the good guys were.</i>

93
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,321
Excuse me,
when you negotiate with those people,

94
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,441
do you give them what they want
or do you just have a chinwag

95
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,041
to buy some time or...?

96
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,121
- Well, don't answer me, I just...
- Every case is different.

97
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,201
Sure, I'm sorry.

98
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,281
But...

99
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:42,801
But well, yes,
we try to calm things down

100
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:44,121
and buy some time.

101
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,361
Thanks.

102
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,721
<i>In fact, we were the ones buying time,</i>

103
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>the sentence time is money
had never been better used.</i>

104
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:53,841
<i>A lot of money.</i>

105
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:56,281
<i>Every hour we printed eight million euros,</i>

106
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,601
<i>1400 sheets of paper money
from which we cut</i>

107
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:02,121
<i>140,000 50 euro notes.</i>

108
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,641
<i>Everything was so calm
during the hours of dawn</i>

109
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,681
<i>that it seemed the plan
was going smoothly.</i>

110
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,241
<i>The Profesor was our Big Brother,</i>

111
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:22,121
<i>controlled the police radio
and 18 cameras,</i>

112
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:25,601
<i>so if somebody wanted to fuck us,</i>

113
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,401
<i>we'd knew it well in advance.</i>

114
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,761
<i>We took turns to watch the hostages,</i>

115
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,841
<i>the entries and of course
the production.</i>

116
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,401
<i>After only 20 hours there
the presses had already spit</i>

117
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:41,961
<i>52 million euros,</i>

118
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,241
<i>so at that point
we all thought it was possible.</i>

119
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,201
<i>But all that calm was just the dead calm</i>

120
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:51,201
<i>before the storm,
things were going to screw up so much</i>

121
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,801
<i>we would be on the brink
of losing the game.</i>

122
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,041
<i>And if you ask me why,</i>

123
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,961
<i>I'll say it's due to a simple love story.</i>

124
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,401
<i>After all, love is a good reason</i>

125
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,001
<i>to make everything go wrong.</i>

126
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:40,281
<i>My daughter, I know
you don't like Paula sleeping in your bed,</i>

127
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,881
<i>but she insisted
and I didn't want to argue with her.</i>

128
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,281
<i>Don't get angry.</i>

129
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,481
<i>He has also insisted
on having pasta and melon for dinner.</i>

130
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,761
<i>I know it's a little stodgy,
maybe she'll wake up.</i>

131
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,961
<i>My dear, it's two o'clock.
The girl has woken up</i>

132
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,121
<i>and has puked a little bit,
next time I don't give her melon.</i>

133
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:29,121
<i>She's already asleep,
she told me she's very nervous.</i>

134
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:32,401
<i>Remember that tomorrow
it's her birthday.</i>

135
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,601
I'd like to ask you a favour.

136
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:09,361
May I?

137
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,481
<i>There's movement.
Everyone ready.</i>

138
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,921
Deputy inspector,
they're opening the doors.

139
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,641
<i>There are seven men,
armed with M-16s, sir.</i>

140
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,041
Everybody stand by.
Stand by my order.

141
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,281
Don't do anything, all right?

142
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:47,321
- It's a unique opportunity.
- Don't do anything.

143
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,481
Take out your mask.

144
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:00,201
I'm begging you, please, not to shoot.

145
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,361
My name's Mónica Gaztambide.

146
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,121
She's a hostage.

147
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,761
I'm just here to read a statement.

148
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,721
<i>I'm speaking on behalf of the robbers.</i>

149
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:17,081
The situation is this.
We're 67 hostages,

150
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:22,321
all of us in perfect health
and well cared of.

151
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,881
There are no victims or wounded.
We're all dressed alike

152
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,281
and it's impossible to tell us
from the robbers,

153
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:35,361
so any attempts of assault

154
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,321
- could cost the lives...
<i>- The Dalí with the megaphone</i>

155
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,401
<i>is giving her orders.
The one with the megaphone is a robber.</i>

156
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,881
They wanted to take some money
which still belonged to no one.

157
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,681
<i>Alert, all units stand by.</i>

158
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:49,001
<i>Target in range,
waiting for instructions.</i>

159
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,921
... will tell the press
the whole truth about negotiation,

160
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:55,081
both the requests
that are accepted

161
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,201
as well as the ones that don't.

162
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:58,761
<i>I require a green light, sir.</i>

163
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:03,281
Still, still everybody,
All right? Hold still.

164
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:06,841
<i>They regret the wounded policeman
and hope wholeheartedly</i>

165
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,481
<i>he recovers.</i>

166
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,961
<i>The one with the megaphone, sir,
is a robber.</i>

167
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,081
<i>I request the green light, sir.</i>

168
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:21,841
<i>Target at range.</i>

169
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,201
<i>They're coming in, last chance, sir.</i>

170
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,201
<i>Last chance, sir.</i>

171
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,281
<i>They're coming in, I repeat,
they're coming in.</i>

172
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:31,521
No, don't shoot.

173
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:35,241
Don't shoot, do you hear me? Let them in,

174
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:38,361
let them go back in.
Do you hear me? Let them in.

175
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,201
<i>As we have just seen,
the robbers have read a statement</i>

176
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,881
<i>where they said they regret
having hurt the police officers.</i>

177
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,841
It seems the hostages
are in perfect health

178
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:53,321
<i>and the assailants
do not intend to use violence.</i>

179
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:57,321
Come on, ladies, a little energy
in the morning, and wake-up.

180
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:00,721
Come on, go to the museum.
To the museum, go!

181
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,001
Come on, man.

182
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,961
Oh, Helsin.

183
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:09,201
<i>I want dough, dough.
You want dough, dough.</i>

184
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:13,881
<i>We want dough, dough.
And I want dough, dough.</i>

185
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,881
Oh, God, Helsin.

186
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,441
Helsin, the one we're messing with, Chicky.

187
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:21,041
Do you know what we're doing?
Do you know that now

188
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,961
the whole world, the whole press,
all the newspapers, the radio

189
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,681
are going to start talking about us.
because we are heroes,

190
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,321
because no one has done this?

191
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,161
I'm gonna tell the truth.
We are locked up

192
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:35,001
and we really don't know
how long this could last,

193
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:38,601
but as long as they don't blow
my head up, I'll take care of you.

194
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,961
As long as you don't try to trick me,

195
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:45,401
or communicate with the outside,

196
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:47,921
everything will be fine.

197
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:53,241
If you have any heroic concerns,
I advise you to forget it.

198
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,801
There are nicer ways
to make your co-workers fall in love.

199
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:03,481
From now on we're getting organized.

200
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:09,121
We're giving you some tasks
so you don't feel down.

201
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:14,281
- What's your name?
- Pablo.

202
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:15,721
Do you do sport?

203
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,801
Yes, I'm the athletic captain at school.

204
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,361
Step forward, captain.

205
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:32,401
Step forward.

206
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,401
Man!

207
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,041
Arturito.

208
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:41,601
- Did you sleep well?
- Well, yes.

209
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:45,721
Fine. Tell me, are you good at DIY?

210
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:48,721
No, no, sir, I'm totally hopeless.

211
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,441
In fact, when I have a flat tyre,
my wife changed it.

212
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,881
Are you telling me you don't have a drill?

213
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,561
- No.
- Think carefully what you say,

214
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,681
because I have
a fucking lie detector right here.

215
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:06,641
Yes.

216
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,881
Let's see... Second chance.
Are you good at DIY?

217
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,601
- I hold my own.
- Step forward.

218
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:27,401
What's your name?

219
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:31,441
- Sonsoles.
- Sonsoles, step forward.

220
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:35,401
Would you feel better
if we brought you an anxiolytic?

221
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,921
- Yes, please.
- Very well.

222
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:41,881
- Does anyone else need medication?
- Me. I'm diabetic.

223
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,001
I'd need the insulin
for this afternoon.

224
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:47,521
Come with Sonsoles, please. Quickly.

225
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:50,881
And me.

226
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:53,921
I'm taking sertraline.

227
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,681
Anyone else?

228
00:15:58,561 --> 00:15:59,521
Me.

229
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,081
I'd like to ask for an abortion pill.

230
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:08,601
You said you don't know
how many days we'll be here

231
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,521
and I'd like to sort this out
as soon as possible.

232
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,641
You'll get it today. You, come with me,

233
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:15,761
I'm taking you to Mr. Román's office,
you'll be more relaxed there.

234
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,401
I also have a request.

235
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,601
Yes?

236
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:24,081
I'd like to erase a picture
from the internet.

237
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,121
I'm sorry, that's not in my hands.

238
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:28,441
I've been tricked,
they took me to a toilet

239
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,121
and they got a picture of me naked.

240
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,721
And now my parents, my teachers,
all the media are seeing it.

241
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,921
You can record a message,
a video, so they calm down,

242
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,281
and we'll send it.

243
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:47,921
All of you will be allowed
to record messages for your families.

244
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,801
Nairobi, come on.

245
00:16:56,681 --> 00:17:00,521
Come on, tough guys,
your hands behind your head

246
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,081
and move to the left in a row,
sticking your chests out

247
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:06,281
as if you were the national team.
Move, athlete.

248
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,201
Move.

249
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:27,961
Do you see this dotted line?

250
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:30,921
Do you see it, damn it?

251
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:35,441
You're going to break the concrete
not going one centimetre away from it,

252
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,481
as if it were a cut-out for children.

253
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,081
There are 48 metres downward
until you get to the sewer pipe.

254
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:46,681
The shift will last three hours.
And when you finish your shift

255
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:50,001
and you go back with the hostages,
not a fucking word

256
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:52,001
about what we're doing down here.

257
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:54,001
- Any questions?
- No.

258
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,321
That's good, which means I was clear.

259
00:17:57,161 --> 00:18:00,761
Come on, let's get to work.
You, put on the hearing protection

260
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:03,801
- and take the hammer.
- I've never used one of those.

261
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,441
There's a first time for everything.

262
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:17,121
And be careful.

263
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:21,281
You wouldn't be the first one
to lose a foot with that.

264
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:27,881
Stop, stop, stop.

265
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,281
Let's see, relax your knees,
that you're going to shell out.

266
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:33,961
And enjoy, damn it.

267
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,801
- Dad, mum, I'm fine.
- In Spanish, please.

268
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,681
Hi, dad. Hi, mum.

269
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,201
I think a lot about you and Lis.

270
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:59,201
I'm fine, they feed us
and I've slept in a bag,

271
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,121
like in a camp.

272
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:07,361
Mum, this is not awful, okay?
There's no violence.

273
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,521
I guess you'll be crying
all day long

274
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,881
thinking we'd have to be
in Belfast,

275
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,961
but you just have to think
I'm fine,

276
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,201
that I'll get out, that we'll all get out.

277
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:26,201
Mum, <i>mamá.</i>

278
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,481
I guess you've seen the photo
I uploaded on the internet.

279
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:34,321
I didn't upload that photo and it doesn't
have to do with the kidnapping,

280
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,561
it was a classmate who tricked me and...

281
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,201
I can't.

282
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,401
It's that I don't know very well
what to say to your parents

283
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:51,881
when you're in a kidnapping.

284
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,641
And you show a tit over the Internet.

285
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:00,641
Well, you think the phone
is not active.

286
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:04,961
So we can repeat the video
as many times as you want

287
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,721
and then we send the one you like the most.

288
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,121
Like in the outtakes
from a movie?

289
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:11,641
Yes.

290
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,801
Do not give so much importance
to this photo. It's...

291
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:19,881
It's just like when you go topless
on the beach, you know?

292
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,041
Nobody cares.

293
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,241
I don't go topless on the beach.

294
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:28,401
And I don't kiss with boys
in the toilets of a museum.

295
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:32,081
When my arm was put in a cast
it was the most exciting thing

296
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:33,361
that happened to me this year.

297
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,401
A kidnapping is more exciting.

298
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:47,761
Well, think about
what you're telling your parents, okay?

299
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,161
And calm down, I'll wait for you. Here.

300
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,801
- You're serious. What's wrong?
- Why the fuck do you care?

301
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,881
I'm just a child, the bedtime hobby

302
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,161
of the last five months, right?

303
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:11,801
The silly guy with the badge.

304
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:15,561
I said you were a child
and that I never would be with you

305
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:17,881
so that you didn't get a bullet
in your breastbone,

306
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,921
because I don't give a damn
if it's me who gets it.

307
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,121
You don't believe that,
you didn't do it for me.

308
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,801
What's the matter with you all?
Since I came here

309
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:26,281
you're always making scenes.

310
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:29,761
They've turned on a phone.

311
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:34,241
It's Alison Parker's.

312
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,521
Hack it.

313
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:39,881
You know what's up?
I'm sure you've waited

314
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,761
until we got of Toledo to start

315
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:44,121
with all this fucking shit
that I'm a child.

316
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:46,041
She's trying to log in in her profile.

317
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:48,321
Come on, come on.

318
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,201
If I was your fucking gigolo,
just tell me.

319
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,961
You were my fucking gigolo.

320
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:01,921
You were everything.

321
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:04,361
- I'm inside.
- Record it.

322
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,041
I don't want to go on
with this conversation.

323
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:11,561
You have the fucking nerve
to tell me you're mourning

324
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,521
for your boyfriend, right?
You didn't seem to be mourning

325
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:15,961
when you asked me
to push you against the wall.

326
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:17,841
I didn't see the rosary
among your fingers.

327
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:21,681
If you ever talk to me that way,
I'll smash your face.

328
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:24,641
Change to selfie camera.

329
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:34,521
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

330
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:36,401
<i>- No, no!
- Fucking hell, give me that!</i>

331
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:37,641
Hold on!

332
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,281
It's offline.

333
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:43,081
Rewind.

334
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:45,081
Stop it. Double the pixels.

335
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:53,801
We've got him.

336
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,041
You know my bubbles
are magical, aren't they?

337
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,161
Yes!

338
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:06,361
Because the wishes are fulfilled.

339
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:22,881
Yes?

340
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:25,161
<i>I have a gift for the girl,
I'm at the door.</i>

341
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:28,681
You have a restraining order,
Get the hell out of here.

342
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,561
<i>I want to see my daughter
on your birthday.</i>

343
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,841
<i>And you can trample on me,
but not her.</i>

344
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:34,601
I'm recording you.

345
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,521
Aitana.

346
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:53,201
What do you got there?

347
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:57,281
- What's in your hand, honey?
- I don't have anything.

348
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,601
Show it to me.

349
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,521
Let's see, open your hand.

350
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:06,281
Open your hand. What is this,
where did you get it from?

351
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,881
Where we paint ourselves
the butterflies.

352
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,441
- Hello?
<i>- You call me at six in the morning</i>

353
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,401
<i>and leave a confusing message</i>

354
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,241
<i>where you talk about being a figurehead,</i>

355
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:46,201
<i>thugs and empty words.
That you would like to be elastic</i>

356
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:49,201
<i>and get your panties down.
Well, I'm not bearing that in mind.</i>

357
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:53,281
You resign and leave a robbery
with 67 hostages inside.

358
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,721
<i>I'm just phoning you</i>

359
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:58,281
<i>so you fucking tell me
you're not taking on it.</i>

360
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:01,161
I'm taking on it.

361
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:04,881
Raquel, there are things
which are above you.

362
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:09,001
<i>National Security,
the Foreign Office, the CNI...</i>

363
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:13,401
But, remember well,
you're the only person I know

364
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:16,521
<i>who can solve this without violence.</i>

365
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:20,961
Thanks, superintendent.

366
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:23,721
And now go back to that tent
and take the lead.

367
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,961
We have the face of one of the robbers.

368
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:28,601
Cheer up, come on!

369
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:32,321
I know they're tired,
but that's one hour, one hour!

370
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,361
One more hour,
one million in one hour

371
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:36,881
and what's left over for you,
I swear on my mother!

372
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,001
Come on, man!

373
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,561
To burst the machine,
to put it to the top!

374
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,281
Nobody did this!

375
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:57,721
- They're going to kill us.
- But what are you saying?

376
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:59,121
- They're going to kill us.
- Hush!

377
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,001
And then they'll run away
using the tunnel

378
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:04,041
we're making for them.
It'll be a slaughter.

379
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:05,841
Shut up, you don't know anything.

380
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:10,761
Think for a while, huh? Do you think

381
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:13,521
they are so stupid as to let us free

382
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:17,761
so we go to the police station
to recognise them? Think, jeez.

383
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:21,841
We're fucked up.
Two times they've told me

384
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,161
I'm a dead man.

385
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,801
- Look what's under the canvas.
- Huh?

386
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,281
Look what's under them.
I'm not staying here

387
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:33,841
waiting like a guinea pig
on my knees to be killed

388
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,121
without doing anything.
Look under the canvas,

389
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,001
see if you find weapons at least, come on.

390
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:42,921
- I'll cover you, come on.
- No way, no way.

391
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,401
Put your gut into it.
What's the matter, captain?

392
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,001
- No way, no way.
- Weren't you the captain

393
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,681
- of the rugby team?
- Athletics.

394
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,801
Hurry then.

395
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:04,841
There are containers.

396
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,281
- It's petrol.
- Jesus!

397
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,681
- And ammunition.
- Holy shit!

398
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:19,921
What's that?

399
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,801
Are they drugs?

400
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:26,921
This is heroin. It's heroin, man.

401
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,521
Jeez, leave that right now,
it's fucking plastic explosive.

402
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:33,441
Leave it, come to dig, come to dig.

403
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:41,241
Can anybody tell me why that machine

404
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:43,521
- isn't working?
- We're resting.

405
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:46,921
You'll rest when I tell you.
Or when it's your turn.

406
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:49,681
Okay, we're going on now.

407
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:16,641
Inspector, please.

408
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:19,361
Inspector, is there a conflict
between Intelligence and the Police?

409
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:22,601
Were the negotiations cancelled
because of your family situation

410
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:24,641
- after your complaint for ill-treatment?
- What?

411
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:25,881
That's all, okay?

412
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:29,521
- How does that scum know that?
- I don't know.

413
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:35,281
You're already back?

414
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,601
- Have you got a minute?
- Sure.

415
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:53,081
Colonel Prieto.

416
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:57,681
Look, I've been a bit nervous
these last hours,

417
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:00,401
but I'd like to keep
a smoother communication with you.

418
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:04,081
I think both of us
can contribute a lot in this crisis.

419
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:08,601
I appreciate your "mea culpa".
So here I am,

420
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,641
completely at your disposal.
But I want you to know,

421
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:14,401
before there are any misunderstandings,

422
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:17,001
that I'm a married man.

423
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:21,201
Raquel, Raquel.

424
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,801
A male, not older than 25,
we recorded him with Alison Parker's

425
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:26,681
- mobile phone.
- Identity?

426
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:29,001
We're on it, facial recognition

427
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,561
are checking the PERPOL.

428
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:33,841
- I want to see the whole video.
- Play the image.

429
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,561
We couldn't record more than six seconds.

430
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:44,761
Stop it there.

431
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:46,801
It looks like a Makarov.

432
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,361
No, it's a Strizh 9mm, it's also Russian.

433
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:52,321
It's rare to see them here.

434
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:55,321
Tell the judicial police to question

435
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:58,681
all the informers from the East
in control of the black market.

436
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,721
- What's that on the wall?
- Telephones.

437
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:05,081
Play the images of the back camera.

438
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:13,601
What do the labels say? Enlarge.

439
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:16,281
The hostage list?

440
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:24,001
They're their phones.

441
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,961
Recognition can have his identity

442
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:28,441
- in an hour or two.
- No.

443
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:31,041
No, we're not waiting so long.

444
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:26,441
Don't you find striking
such a special connection?

445
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,201
<i>I was just about to call you,
at this very moment.</i>

446
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,641
Well, considering I'm the negotiator

447
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,401
- and you the robber...
- But we shouldn't allow

448
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,801
this crime interfere
with our relationship.

449
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,921
Don't know about you,
but I see this as a chance.

450
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:42,201
<i>- A chance for what?</i>
- To get to know each other.

451
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,361
<i>I assure you that if we had met in a bar,</i>

452
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:46,681
<i>you wouldn't have paid
any attention to me.</i>

453
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,681
<i>Tell me, inspector.</i>

454
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,241
Have you ever faked an orgasm?

455
00:31:58,281 --> 00:31:59,241
No.

456
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:02,201
<i>Please, inspector,
I beg you, don't lie to me.</i>

457
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:03,801
Think about it, please.

458
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:10,001
Maybe yes, maybe I've done it.

459
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:15,241
Look, men are programmed to ejaculate
within the shortest time.

460
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:17,761
<i>Women, to last
the longest time possible.</i>

461
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,921
And that small feature of nature
sometimes is solved with a fake orgasm.

462
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:22,641
of nature sometimes is solved
with a fake orgasm.

463
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:28,041
And that's nothing but a small swindle.
A lie.

464
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:33,601
<i>Such as last evening's intervention,
with three elite corps.</i>

465
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:36,001
<i>Inspector, I'm begging you
not to lie to me,</i>

466
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:37,961
<i>you'll put at risk innocent people.</i>

467
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:41,761
I won't. And now tell me,
why did you want to call me?

468
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:45,001
Look, we need food and some medication:

469
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:49,881
insulin, sertraline, albuterol,
an abortion pill

470
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,121
<i>- and anxiolytics.</i>
- An abortion pill?

471
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,641
Requests from the hostages.

472
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:58,481
We all have personal problems,
don't you think?

473
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,801
- You'll get those requests.
<i>- Fine.</i>

474
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:04,281
<i>Civil Protection will make the delivery,</i>

475
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,361
<i>in transparent bags
to avoid hidden weapons.</i>

476
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,841
<i>And now tell me,
you phoned me to...</i>

477
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:12,921
So you surrender immediately.

478
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:18,601
I've got images from the inside,
I've got the identity of one of your men.

479
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:21,281
<i>If I keep on pulling the thread,
I'll know the identity</i>

480
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,401
<i>of the rest of the gang.</i>

481
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:26,481
- Inspector, I think...
<i>- I'm offering you a deal.</i>

482
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,641
I can lower your sentences
from 16 to 8 years,

483
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,281
if you get out of there right now.

484
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,961
<i>Nobody has died
and that gives me a little margin.</i>

485
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,241
I don't think it's a fair deal,
we lose out.

486
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:41,201
You've already lost.
Look, in the rare event

487
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:44,361
you get out of there,
your faces will be in the news,

488
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:45,881
<i>police stations and borders.</i>

489
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:48,561
<i>You're left without a plan B.</i>

490
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:51,721
<i>- Then we'll activate plan C.</i>
- You think I'm bluffing, right?

491
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:52,921
Frankly, yes.

492
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:55,561
I'll tell you something
so you see I'm not lying:

493
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:59,521
<i>you've got 67 mobile phones
attached with Velcro on the wall.</i>

494
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,761
I give you one hour to accept my offer.

495
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:07,041
<i>Listen, inspec....</i>

496
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:19,601
What if it doesn't work out?

497
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,161
- What's gonna happen if it doesn't work out?
- Let's see, puppy,

498
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:25,721
the same as always:
back to the gaol,

499
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:30,041
to the cigarette in the courtyard,
to the four prawns for Christmas,

500
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,361
- the vis-a-vis, sometimes.
- A luxury!

501
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,121
The fucked up is if it goes well.
What the hell are we going to do

502
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,121
with so much dough?

503
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:40,681
I'm going to get a Maserati,
clear blue sky, huh?

504
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:42,921
- Say yes.
- And a martial arts gym.

505
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:44,081
I see it.

506
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,961
And a big joint,
but three-story, huh?

507
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:48,281
With speakers that bleed your ears.

508
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:51,001
- Boom, boom, bam, bim bam bum.
- Say yes.

509
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:54,761
- This one with three million has plenty.
- And for you some lungs,

510
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,721
that you've got them fucked up
of the mine.

511
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:59,161
You're going to spend it on that,
in some lungs?

512
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:00,481
You're a piece of work.

513
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:03,841
And can you tell where the fuck
are you going to take out some lungs?

514
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:07,001
If there are people who sell their kidneys,
there'll be people selling lungs,

515
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:08,761
I think.

516
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:11,481
Well, I in a wine cellar in Provence.

517
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:14,801
In hectares of vineyard
to grow my own wine,

518
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:18,321
oak barrels...

519
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:20,801
But you can go to the supermarket
that you like

520
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:23,081
and buy the bottle that you want.

521
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,001
Why are you going
to set up a wine cellar?

522
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:26,121
For art.

523
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:30,961
So I want an island.

524
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:33,681
- And me another.
- Then put on three.

525
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,961
- Three is a crowd already.
- An archipelago.

526
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:40,641
No, I want a little island
with an enormous house,

527
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,281
and a balcony
that is attached to the sea.

528
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:47,001
It's me getting out of bed
and straight into the water.

529
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,241
Well, finally someone smart.

530
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:52,041
I think some of us first have to fix

531
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:55,561
some business, don't we?
Come on, at least I do.

532
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:59,441
And listen, then with what
I can spare for a plane.

533
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:02,961
- To drive it myself.
- Being able to have a very hot pilot...

534
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,161
You don't get it,
what's cool is to tease

535
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:08,601
the guy in the control tower and say:
"Hey, give airstrip for the artist."

536
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:13,961
If we buy all those things
let's say for a price...

537
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:17,041
I don't know, an expensive price,
a very expensive price.

538
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:21,801
Even then we'd still
have a huge amount of money.

539
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:23,681
If we're going to steal big,

540
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:27,121
dream big.

541
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,561
I would record an album.
Of corridos.

542
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,481
Like that, and on the cover all my face.

543
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,921
You are going to be like Bertín Osborne,
but with 30 kilos more.

544
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:38,521
- Uy, uy.
- What are you talking about?

545
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:40,921
Bertín sings rancheras,
I told you corridos,

546
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:42,361
which is something very different.

547
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:44,281
Show him what a corrido is, Dad.

548
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:45,721
- No way, man...
- Come on.

549
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:47,321
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, go for it.

550
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:49,921
- But if you love to do it.
- How am I going to sing?

551
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:51,921
Sing! Sing! Sing!

552
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:53,281
He's even up.

553
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:58,121
<i>For the lack of your lips
I cried for the first time</i>

554
00:36:58,761 --> 00:37:04,481
<i>and I cursed to know you
for not stopping loving you.</i>

555
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:07,961
<i>I wanted to make you my wife,</i>

556
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:11,041
<i>without love I sought luck,</i>

557
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:14,361
<i>I was pulling a gun</i>

558
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:18,241
<i>and fate brought death.</i>

559
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:23,041
<i>María, my life, my love.</i>

560
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:27,681
<i>I won't stop loving you,</i>

561
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:31,481
<i>to bullets I lost you,</i>

562
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:36,281
<i>you'll never see me again.</i>

563
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,641
<i>Hello, Profesor?</i>

564
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,881
They have an image
of all the phones on the wall.

565
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:10,561
There are no security cameras
there, right?

566
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,481
<i>No, of course not, only the one we set.</i>

567
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:15,441
So it was one of the hostages.

568
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:19,481
You missed a phone, so find it

569
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:22,321
- or we're screwed up.
<i>- Give me permission to punish him.</i>

570
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:25,441
<i>Either we block them with panic
or they'll keep on playing the heroes.</i>

571
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:28,241
- What punishment?
<i>- An exemplary punishment.</i>

572
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:32,321
<i>- His execution, for example?</i>
- No.

573
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:36,241
Find that phone.

574
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:40,081
We must call the police
and guide them through the assault.

575
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:42,721
There's a phone in my office,
in a coat that's hanging

576
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,321
- from a hanger.
- No way.

577
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:47,361
- Listen, you've had 40 seconds...
- You go!

578
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:48,601
I can't, I can't.

579
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,801
You know what'd happen
if there's somebody there?

580
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,521
- They'd shoot me.
- Just like...

581
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:55,561
I want to hear
that machine working, jeez!

582
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:59,721
- I don't want to say that again!
- Sorry, sorry, we're sorry.

583
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:04,481
- He's very tired. Sorry.
- I can't go on.

584
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:07,121
- I'm going to die, I can't go on.
- Come on, get out of there.

585
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,881
Get out and rest.

586
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:12,321
<i>That phone that for Arturo
it seemed like salvation</i>

587
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:14,921
<i>was actually
stained with death.</i>

588
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,001
<i>And what they didn't do
cowardly</i>

589
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:21,921
<i>would make him the most innocent
with that fatality that love gives,</i>

590
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,761
<i>sealing your destiny
for the rest of his days.</i>

591
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,201
Are you really going to abort?

592
00:39:36,801 --> 00:39:38,641
Sorry about what I said yesterday, Mónica.

593
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:41,441
It was out of place, I was an arsehole.

594
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,721
I've never been a very brave guy,
you know?

595
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:50,561
I've spent all my fucking life
doing what the others

596
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,841
wanted from me,
never what I wanted to do.

597
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,641
And I needed to be
in a situation such as this, jeez,

598
00:40:00,921 --> 00:40:04,601
with guns and bullets,
to realise

599
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:06,001
what I really want.

600
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:08,441
And I'm going to think about me.

601
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,081
Me and you.

602
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,961
And that baby you have inside.

603
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:18,721
I love you, Mónica.

604
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:21,761
I love you so much, that I know.

605
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,601
You're the best
that's ever happened to me.

606
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:30,361
I want you to continue with the pregnancy

607
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:33,041
and I want you to let me be his father.

608
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,841
We're going to have a baby.

609
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,681
And I want to form a family with you
if we get out of here.

610
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,721
What do you mean, if we get out?

611
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,881
- They're digging a tunnel.
- What?

612
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:56,321
Yes, they have a lot of plastic explosive

613
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:57,561
and petrol containers.

614
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,001
- Stand up!
- It'll be a slaughter.

615
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,441
There's one way: contact the police

616
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:05,121
and guide them in the assault.
I've got a phone in my office,

617
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:06,241
in the coat.

618
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,001
I don't know how to get there.

619
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:13,481
- I'll go.
- No, no, no.

620
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:20,681
There's always a hero...

621
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:25,081
who thinks he can save the others.

622
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:28,961
Who thinks...

623
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:34,601
nobody will notice that he's plotting

624
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:38,481
a strategy to contact the police.

625
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:40,201
Bravo.

626
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:46,321
Congratulations,
because one of you made it,

627
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:49,761
recorded an image from the inside

628
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,601
and sent it to the police.

629
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:55,281
<i>Aníbal Cortés, born in Getafe.</i>

630
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:58,121
He's an alarm expert, worked for two years

631
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:00,761
in security companies,
he's associated with the robbery

632
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:02,841
of a mansion in Geneva.
He's got a warrant

633
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,801
issued by the Interpol.

634
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:08,881
So I'd like to give him the chance

635
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,481
to step forward

636
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,801
so you can all thank him.

637
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,681
And also give me that phone.

638
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:16,881
He must have visited the Casa de la Moneda

639
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:21,121
to study the alarm systems.
Check the hard drives

640
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,561
of the security company.

641
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:25,281
With a bit of luck,
maybe he went there

642
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:26,561
with some other gang members.

643
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:27,761
Helsinki.

644
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,481
Undress him.

645
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:30,601
Come on.

646
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,361
Are you sick or what?

647
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:34,041
Pay attention.

648
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:38,281
Come on, take off your shirt.

649
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:41,321
- Come on.
- It was one of you.

650
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,921
I don't know who it was.

651
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,481
Denver, undress her.

652
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:08,241
You recorded a video

653
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:11,481
in the phone room, right?

654
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:22,081
- What's up?
- I can't breathe.

655
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:25,841
Let me go with the girls.
Let me go with the girls!

656
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,481
Berlín, I'm taking her away.

657
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:33,481
- Berlín, Berlín.
- What's the matter now?

658
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:37,321
I know what happened.

659
00:43:38,761 --> 00:43:42,161
"An assault to the epicentre of money,
the most outstanding robbery ever.

660
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:45,401
Bizarre robbery calls
international attention."

661
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:48,961
- What do you think? Do you want a coffee?
- Jesus, we have an officer in the ICU,

662
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:52,161
67 hostages,
a lot of guys armed to the teeth

663
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:54,641
and for the reporters
this is something colourful.

664
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,321
I don't care about the headlines,
what worries me

665
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:59,961
is that they have too much information
and that doesn't help us.

666
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:01,201
- Listen.
- Wait.

667
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:03,081
Listen to me, all of you.

668
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,281
Some of you
is talking too much with his brother-in-law,

669
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:09,801
with a neighbor
or with a journalist without knowing it.

670
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:13,001
The one who opens its mouth too wide
if only to give

671
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:16,001
the bloody hour will be suspended
of employment and salary.

672
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:17,121
Are you okay?

673
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:21,361
I'm going out for lunch.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

674
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:22,601
All right.

675
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,601
Do I go with you?

676
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:28,561
No. It's better.

677
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:32,161
Don't let your wife see us
and get jealous.

678
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:39,201
Listen, the inspector is coming out.
Move the paparazzi away.

679
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:46,441
I got distracted for a while
and I saw Alison trying

680
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,121
to erase the fucking photo, that's all.
A mistake, that's all.

681
00:44:49,281 --> 00:44:51,121
What's up,
have you got an attention deficit?

682
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:53,521
Because if you're
one of those children with problems,

683
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:55,481
I should be the first to know.

684
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,361
I haven't got any problems.

685
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:04,281
Tokio came in, all right?
And we argued, that's it.

686
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:06,681
- It won't happen again.
- Now I see.

687
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:12,601
One more time, it all comes down
to a sentimental reason.

688
00:45:15,641 --> 00:45:18,201
You don't know
how much you remind me of myself.

689
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:24,841
I was 18, she was 44,
she was my French teacher,

690
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:27,121
- I was outstanding.
- I don't know what this is about,

691
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:29,521
- Tokio isn't 44.
- She's 15 years older than you.

692
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:33,921
And when you're young
and you're with a woman

693
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:36,361
who's halfway through,
everything sublimates.

694
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,161
They've got the experience
teenage girls don't have

695
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,401
and they're even more grateful
than the ugly ones.

696
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:50,041
My teacher gave me
her mature flesh every time

697
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:53,601
as if it was my fucking birthday.
You know why?

698
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:59,241
Because with you
they savour the lost youth,

699
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,041
before tumbling down

700
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:03,481
the slope of age.

701
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:17,921
Of course...

702
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:23,801
Of course there's a small difference
between your love story and mine.

703
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,561
In my case, I wasn't
in a robbery with hostages,

704
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:29,961
endangering my mates' lives.

705
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:25,601
- Are you still hurt from yesterday or what?
- A little bit.

706
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:32,561
Hey, what I told you about the rosary

707
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:35,801
was not good at all,
I was an asshole.

708
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:37,841
Sorry.

709
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:40,001
Yes, but I like you like this.

710
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,601
It's that I'm retarded.

711
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:48,241
I get into a robbery with 70 hostages.
and me there,

712
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:50,641
- with the engagement plate.
- You are original.

713
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,441
I don't think many girls
can brag about something like that.

714
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:00,521
When you had the hots
for somebody

715
00:48:00,681 --> 00:48:01,921
you don't think straight.

716
00:48:03,721 --> 00:48:07,001
Furthermore, you said it yourself
and you're right,

717
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:09,601
love is not the same
as a couple of shags.

718
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:15,201
Are you trying to leave me?

719
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:17,561
There's nothing to leave.

720
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:20,761
I'm just remarking on the situation.

721
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:25,761
And what's changed
from yesterday to today?

722
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:28,801
Well, what you said about age
and that I don't see you excited

723
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:29,961
with our affair.

724
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:34,041
And I've been talking for five minutes
with that girl...

725
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:35,761
With Alison. And...

726
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:39,241
And I've realized
that you're right,

727
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:42,001
I have to look for a young girl,
like her.

728
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,121
Fucking hell, you've got a nerve!

729
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,241
Do I get my badge back?

730
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:00,041
Your little plate.

731
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:01,881
Look who's coming.

732
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,201
So it's already clear
what you have to say?

733
00:49:11,961 --> 00:49:13,841
- Yes, sir.
- Wonderful,

734
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:15,361
picking up the lesson
quick on the uptake.

735
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:17,761
Ready?

736
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:44,921
Leave the boxes on the ground
and go back really slowly.

737
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:23,041
<i>There's a phone in my office,
in a coat...</i>

738
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:33,641
It's very hot here.

739
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:24,041
- I'm going...
- Hey!

740
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:27,361
May I?

741
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:34,601
Sit down.

742
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:37,601
Sit down!

743
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:51,641
The medicine is here.

744
00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:56,201
Hand them out.

745
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:04,481
- I'm going to sit down.
- Wait.

746
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:09,361
Come outside.

747
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,001
Come outside.

748
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:49,681
You may think
what I'm telling you is bullshit.

749
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:52,041
Doesn't make much sense
to tell you this.

750
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:53,721
a guy with a gun, right?

751
00:52:56,561 --> 00:52:58,881
I don't think
abortion is a very good idea.

752
00:53:13,201 --> 00:53:14,161
Thanks.

753
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:31,161
<i>The kidnappers have been locked up</i>

754
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:33,081
<i>in the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda...</i>

755
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:34,281
They're not leaving that place, right?

756
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:40,441
Those people I say.
I imagine they'll be buying time

757
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:42,881
to set some kind of strategy or...

758
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:48,241
You must be desperate
to do something like that, right?

759
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,161
That's what makes them so dangerous.

760
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:53,561
No, but they don't want to hurt anybody.

761
00:53:55,321 --> 00:53:56,761
Well, that's what they said.

762
00:53:57,561 --> 00:54:00,161
So they wouldn't be armed,
don't you think?

763
00:54:01,361 --> 00:54:02,761
Sure, I guess you're right.

764
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:05,801
But you don't try to rob

765
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:08,321
the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre
with a slingshot, right?

766
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:18,121
The bill, please.

767
00:54:22,121 --> 00:54:24,121
And...? Do you know how many they are?

768
00:54:24,281 --> 00:54:27,841
Because in some places
they say they're seven.

769
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:31,401
Excuse me.

770
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:37,721
Yes.

771
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:41,201
<i>- Raquel, the boy was at the museum.</i>
- How long ago?

772
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:44,241
<i>Three months ago, the cameras got him</i>

773
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:47,281
<i>- as part of a guided tour.</i>
- Was he alone?

774
00:54:47,441 --> 00:54:51,561
<i>No, you were right, he was with someone.
Listen, we have the identity</i>

775
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,481
<i>of another robber,
they sent you his picture</i>

776
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:56,921
<i>from judiciary police,
you should receive</i>

777
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:58,081
<i>it right now.</i>

778
00:55:12,281 --> 00:55:13,241
Ah!

779
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:16,561
- Where have you got it?
- What are you talking about?

780
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,241
- Where is the recorder?
- But what...?

781
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,481
It's a coincidence you're here every day

782
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:24,361
- asking me questions.
- I don't know...

783
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:25,761
- Who do you work for?
- Pardon?

784
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:28,121
- Who the fuck do you work for?
- I'm not a journalist,

785
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:30,041
my name's Salvador Martín,
look my wallet. Antonio, please.

786
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,321
- What's the matter, Salva?
- I don't know...

787
00:55:32,481 --> 00:55:34,241
I know him, he comes here every day.

788
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:05,681
You need dough for the baby, right?

789
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:06,801
- Yes.
- No, no...

790
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:11,881
Yes. Listen, this is a robbery,
you may get something for you.

791
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:13,601
No, not really.

792
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:20,641
Hide this in your underwear now.

793
00:56:20,801 --> 00:56:23,081
20 000 bucks, you can buy nappies for him

794
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:24,961
- until he leaves university.
- It's not that.

795
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:28,281
It's really not that.
I appreciate it, but...

796
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:30,561
Give me the pill
and I'm going back inside.

797
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,401
Fine.

798
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:43,081
So what's up?

799
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:47,241
- He'll screw up your life.
- Pardon?

800
00:56:47,401 --> 00:56:50,241
Your son.
It's better he screws up your life

801
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:53,001
rather than any
of these motherfuckers, or me.

802
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:55,681
- Are you going to screw up my life?
- Life gets screwed up very easily.

803
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:57,641
One day you're working smoothly,

804
00:56:57,801 --> 00:57:00,441
four lunatics with Dalí masks come in,

805
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:03,041
one of them goes crazy,
he shoots his gun

806
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:04,281
and fuck off.

807
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:07,041
This screw up your life.

808
00:57:10,921 --> 00:57:12,001
Not a baby.

809
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:18,281
- A baby doesn't screws your life.
- What do you know about what screws me up?

810
00:57:18,441 --> 00:57:19,641
What do you know?

811
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:23,601
My mother wanted to abort me.

812
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:28,641
But before, she chased the dragon
with the junk he had to sell

813
00:57:28,801 --> 00:57:30,481
to pay for the abortion.

814
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:37,481
And the municipal police
arrested her in a shitty portico.

815
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:41,561
I was born among the jail,
the drugs and the police.

816
00:57:42,361 --> 00:57:43,481
And what do you know?

817
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:50,081
Because it seems your job
is not one adventure after another,

818
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:52,161
and when you go out
it isn't a party, either.

819
00:57:52,321 --> 00:57:54,081
- Or do you do "kilates"?
- Pilates...

820
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,001
So I was right.
And you go for a drink on Friday.

821
00:57:56,161 --> 00:57:58,521
Fucking shit, girl,
another plan screwed up due to the baby.

822
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:00,961
Who do you go out with?
Where are your friends?

823
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:04,201
I'll tell you. At home, with their babies.

824
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:07,121
Do they look screwed up? No, right?

825
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:10,961
What crazy thing do you do
that you can't do with a baby?

826
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,841
Do you go in summer to India
to spend 15 days having the runs?

827
00:58:14,001 --> 00:58:17,161
You better go to Gandía,
that you can drink from the faucet

828
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:18,281
and eat pizza.

829
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:51,281
If his father is an arsehole
and he misses it, that's better,

830
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,401
all his affection for you.
Do you know how much he can love you?

831
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:56,321
What are you doing, Denver?

832
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,441
I'm giving her the pill to abort.

833
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,801
What's up? Does she need you
to put it in her mouth

834
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,241
with a little water?

835
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:11,001
Abortion is a private thing, right?

836
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:15,281
Women decide,
but not in front of everybody.

837
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:18,161
Anyway, I'm...

838
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:21,641
I'll think about it
until we get out of here.

839
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:31,841
Wonderful.

840
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:37,361
I'm glad you want to continue
with the pregnancy.

841
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:38,481
Really.

842
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:43,241
Now go back to the office with the others.

843
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:48,721
Did you just come from a stag party?

844
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:51,441
Or were you going there?

845
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:59,721
<i>That wasn't the first time
Berlín put his hand</i>

846
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:01,721
<i>in the knickers of an honest woman,</i>

847
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:04,641
<i>but it'd be the first time
he'd take it out so soon.</i>

848
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:08,241
<i>Maybe Mónica would have preferred
him to let himself go,</i>

849
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:10,401
<i>follow his instinct
and forget about the phone</i>

850
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:13,401
<i>that had rung between her legs,
but it wasn't so.</i>

851
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:19,161
Denver.

852
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:24,841
What will happen with our authority
when I tell the others?

853
01:01:26,761 --> 01:01:30,721
<i>Even Berlín could
distinguish pleasure from duty.</i>

854
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,121
Kill her.

855
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,401
You heard me.

856
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:11,761
Let's see.

857
01:02:21,641 --> 01:02:25,841
<i>You can sense it, suspect it,
but in a fraction of a second.</i>

858
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:28,441
<i>you suddenly realize
those things don't add up</i>

859
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:31,841
<i>and that Río still loved me
and she didn't just leave me.</i>

860
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:34,441
<i>I could feel it so strongly
that pierced the walls,</i>

861
01:02:34,601 --> 01:02:37,081
<i>as strong as love
that I always end up feeling</i>

862
01:02:37,241 --> 01:02:38,881
<i>by all the men who take care of me,</i>

863
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:43,641
<i>whether they are drug dealers,
assholes, kids.</i>

864
01:02:44,721 --> 01:02:47,921
<i>And I felt it just like the first day
that I held him in my arms,</i>

865
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:51,001
<i>the two of us thrown between the stones
of a field in Toledo.</i>

866
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,081
Let's see, we'll be back in 30 minutes.
30 minutes, Denver.

867
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,601
Permission.

868
01:02:56,841 --> 01:03:01,321
Well, I'm going to run for a while,
to stretch the legs a little.

869
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:04,041
Use it, there's a lot of countryside.

870
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:06,641
Learn a language
is a lot easier than it looks,

871
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:09,481
but you have to leave
semantics aside.

872
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:13,121
<i>For the first time I realised
there was something</i>

873
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:15,441
<i>that had always been wrong
in all my love affairs.</i>

874
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:17,881
<i>They had always taken care of me.</i>

875
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:23,081
<i>But this time it'd be different.</i>

876
01:04:34,481 --> 01:04:38,201
What's up? Jesus, Tokio, Tokio. Tokio!

877
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:40,441
Jesus, go and find Berlín.

878
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:20,241
<i>Listen to me. If anybody
touches him again,</i>

879
01:05:20,401 --> 01:05:22,081
I swear to God that the next shot

880
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:25,281
will be against Helsinki,
Berlín or against you.

881
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:31,041
You're out there, free,
while we're risking

882
01:05:31,201 --> 01:05:33,201
<i>our fucking lives in this mouse trap.</i>

883
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:42,161
<i>Helsinki, put the gun down.</i>

884
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:43,881
What are you doing?

885
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:46,801
Helsinki.

886
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:53,161
<i>Helsinki.</i>

887
01:05:54,681 --> 01:05:55,641
Put the gun down.

888
01:06:02,641 --> 01:06:04,481
Don't do it, please.

889
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:06,841
Why did you have to get
that fucking phone?

890
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:09,401
Why the hell did you have to trick me?

891
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,241
Río, don't!

892
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:17,961
Where do you think you're going?
You did more than enough today.

893
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:20,361
Helsinki.

894
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,001
Do you know what will happen
if I don't kill you?

895
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:36,601
- They'll kill me.
- No...

896
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:39,481
And then they'll kill you.

897
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,201
So now what?

898
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:47,641
<i>I wasn't even listening to my shouts,
I only wanted to write</i>

899
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:51,361
<i>a fucking love letter.
While the guns and the gazes</i>

900
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:54,521
<i>were pointing at me,
reality fell like a concrete slab</i>

901
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:58,321
<i>and I knew the five months
during which I had believed in something</i>

902
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,441
<i>were over</i>

903
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:01,801
Your love story has fucked up

904
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:04,641
your escape plan. They've got you.

905
01:07:06,361 --> 01:07:08,881
<i>And Río too,
the police know who you are.</i>

906
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:17,761
<i>You're in every news programme.</i>

907
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:38,801
For fuck's sake.

908
01:07:39,801 --> 01:07:41,081
For fuck's sake.

909
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:44,961
Come on, man.

910
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:48,961
Come on, man.

911
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:55,361
On your knees.

912
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,361
No.

913
01:07:59,761 --> 01:08:00,881
Don't look at me.

914
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:04,641
Don't look at me.

915
01:08:04,801 --> 01:08:06,801
- Please.
- Don't fucking look at me,

916
01:08:06,961 --> 01:08:08,321
don't fucking look at me.

917
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:26,561
NEXT EPISODE

918
01:08:58,441 --> 01:09:00,041
Get down, everybody!

919
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:02,481
Don't move!

920
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:12,281
For the last time,
return to your position.

921
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:38,841
Get down, everybody!
