1
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:07,441
I have made the decision to enter.

2
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,241
Sub-inspector Rubio will accompany

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,521
the two surgeons and enter
as a nurse.

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:14,841
One of the restrooms is
an undercover cop.

5
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:17,961
You know what to do.
Perfectly, let's do it.

6
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:23,841
Welcome.
Thank you.

7
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:28,321
We know that those inside
were there before.

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,601
I want you to check the
camera footage.

9
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,681
Release channel 8 for
the hostage crisis.

10
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,241
No one should broadcast
on channel 8.

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,121
- I have breached the first
rule of the plan.

12
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,841
I killed a hostage.

13
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:41,961
Who was she? Mónica Gaztambide.

14
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:43,961
You're gonna have to punish me.

15
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:46,281
Come on, let's see that wound.

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,281
Let's get her out now.

17
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,921
- What are you doing?
- A bullet wound.

18
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,201
- Here, let me do it.

19
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,241
Bring, throw here.
Throw, throw well.

20
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,761
It's the recording of the
day Cortés and Oliveira

21
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,361
visited the museum.

22
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,041
- Get as close as you can.

23
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,641
There, stop it. Enlarge.

24
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,241
They are the keys of a car.
A 92 Ibiza.

25
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,041
Search scrapyards, car cemeteries
and the like.

26
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:15,681
Tell me what, at least,
if they didn't make the junk car,

27
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,521
wiped the fingerprints.

28
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:18,681
I didn't do this.

29
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:25,601
Hey!

30
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,801
You!

31
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,601
I got in because my car
is here and...

32
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,041
I count five and let go of dog.

33
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,121
Do you understand?

34
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:39,041
If you want to negotiate with me,
release eight hostages.

35
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,521
I'll propose something to you.

36
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:43,081
I will give you Alison Parker
and no one else.

37
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,761
This is a matter of state.
I will take responsibility.

38
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:47,921
- Alison Parker.

39
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,881
Yes, it is.

40
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,161
Tokio.

41
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:54,041
"He ordered me to filter
the conversation."

42
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:58,801
You'd rather save Alison Parker's
life than eight?

43
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,281
Yeah, I'm sure.

44
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,921
Hey! Hey!

45
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,841
See who that is and what
he's doing here.

46
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,361
- Stop, police! What are you doing here?

47
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,761
Circle.

48
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,041
It was him!

49
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:50,881
"That Sunday, Raquel Murillo

50
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,161
was just seconds away from
seeing the Profesor.

51
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:58,961
That image was one of the ones
missing to complete the puzzle.

52
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:01,161
of the kidnappers and enter the final phase.

53
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,441
I already had Río's.

54
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,841
Mine.

55
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:07,921
And I was about to have Berlín.

56
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:12,761
The Profesor had foreseen that
Raquel would get these photos.

57
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:15,681
Like a deck of cards that was
slowly coming loose.

58
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,241
to entertain himself by playing cards.

59
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,961
His image was the only one
I should ever find.

60
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:25,601
But it was no longer so
anonymous or unknown.

61
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,761
His image was going to start drawing.

62
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,801
as a hologram in police protocols.

63
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,841
The loose end had put him at great risk.

64
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,961
And now, if the inspector played
her cards right.

65
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,881
and got the Profesor's face,
the game would be over.

66
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:45,081
Checkmate would be irreversible.

67
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,441
"Alison Parker.

68
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,881
Would you rather save Alison Parker's
life than eight?

69
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,481
Yeah, I'm sure.

70
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,241
- That's cold, you didn't hesitate.

71
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:07,881
When one is able to make such
a decision without hesitation,

72
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,801
one is left speechless.

73
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,401
That the lives of eight Spanish boys

74
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:30,601
is worth less than an English
girl's cry to heaven.

75
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:33,521
- Alison Parker is Spanish,
has dual nationality.

76
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:35,801
- Bearing in mind that the main
thing is the hostages,

77
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,681
we must reflect on the role of
Inspector Murillo.

78
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:41,961
I don't know if he's up to a
negotiation of this caliber.

79
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:44,841
- He has an extensive career
within the police force.

80
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,401
Psychologist, criminologist.
What more do you want?

81
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:48,761
- Curriculum is surplus to requirements.

82
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,881
The problem is that right now,
Inspector Raquel Murillo

83
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:55,121
has just filed a complaint of ill-treatment."

84
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,441
- Paula!

85
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:00,521
"You have to see how mentally
affected she is.

86
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:02,881
Probably medicated, unstable..."

87
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,441
- He just spoke to his father.

88
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:09,281
Paula, honey, why don't you tell Mommy

89
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,321
What did your daddy tell you?

90
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,401
Let's go.

91
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,521
- Do I want to live with him and his aunt?

92
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,281
- And what did you say to him, darling?

93
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,041
- That's right.

94
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:27,801
- Daughter, but you know that if
you're going to live with Dad,

95
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,681
we're gonna see a lot less of each other.

96
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,201
- Same as now. You are never home.

97
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,121
- Look, Paula.

98
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:40,681
Mom doesn't want you to live
with Dad because...

99
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:46,201
Because Dad's no good and he's done me
a lot of harm. Understand?

100
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,921
- Dad is good.

101
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,481
- No, daughter, Dad is no good.

102
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,681
- It's not true, Dad told me.

103
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,961
- He told you it's a lie.

104
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,641
You're talking nonsense out there.

105
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:02,841
- I want to live with the aunt.
- But, darling...

106
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,601
Your aunt Marta is a knucklehead.

107
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:10,041
It's wrong for me to tell you because
I'm his mother too.

108
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:13,721
But he's got the brains of a rag,
like your rabbit Eugenio.

109
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,041
- Mama.

110
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:17,121
Don't turn her against her aunt.

111
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:19,641
- It's all right.

112
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:22,921
- Look, honey, you know what we're gonna do?

113
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:26,601
We're gonna go get a burger.
You want some?

114
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,921
- With ketchup?

115
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,761
- With ketchup and potatoes.

116
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,601
And when I finish this job,

117
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,801
we are going to the Canary Islands.

118
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:39,361
To the beach, girl's plan.
What do you think?

119
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:42,121
- Well, if it's a girl's plan, I'm in.

120
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:44,121
- Come on, let's go.

121
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,561
- And also chocolate ice cream.

122
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:49,081
- Chocolate ice cream, okay.

123
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,001
"Questions about this heist that keeps us
in suspense are piling up.

124
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:03,281
Who are the kidnappers?

125
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,161
Were you planning to stay inside?

126
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:08,481
Do they want money or is it a protest
against the financial system?

127
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,881
How long can they hold out

128
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,081
without the police deciding to come in?"

129
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:16,761
Why won't the police come in?

130
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:19,001
Because we're going to lock the door inside.

131
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:21,641
How to itch.

132
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,201
They're not coming in.

133
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,601
because no one in Spain
is going to want me to come in.

134
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,401
- What's the matter, you're going to
have a referendum?

135
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:34,841
Cri, cri.

136
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:36,441
Okay. Let's see.

137
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:37,841
Year 2011.

138
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:39,641
A group of kids

139
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,881
begins to squat the Puerta del Sol,
the most emblematic square.

140
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,201
More than 20 000 people gather there.

141
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,521
- The 15-M, right?

142
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:49,801
That's it.

143
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:52,721
If they get to tell any of us

144
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:55,481
that 20 000 people were going to camp

145
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,601
in Sol for a month without
the police entering,

146
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,401
we would never have believed it.

147
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:03,081
We would have said it's impossible.

148
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,041
- But it was.

149
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,361
And the police didn't come in.

150
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,041
Why is that?

151
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,161
Because all of Spain was with those kids.

152
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:20,441
But those kids wore tents.

153
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,641
and we carry guns.

154
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,801
A little different.
- That's true.

155
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:26,361
- Politics is politics.

156
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:29,121
Money is money.

157
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,721
Sangría is sangría.

158
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,841
No, no, in Serbia, that's why police come in.

159
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:39,281
Yibeli, my friends.

160
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:40,921
- Don't do that!

161
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,561
- What a filth!

162
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:47,801
We're gonna be the resilient ones
trapped in that mousetrap.

163
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,321
in the same way they were the Sun's resistors.

164
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,681
And resistance always falls well.

165
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,361
And if that doesn't work...
You have your audience, don't you?

166
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:07,001
No, sorry, go on, go on.

167
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,361
Thank you.

168
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,681
If that doesn't work,

169
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:17,321
the police will know we have assault weapons, explosives.

170
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,321
No elite unit is going to know how to differentiate

171
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:22,041
hostages of robbers.

172
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:24,041
No Minister of the Interior

173
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,641
is going to give the order to enter, none.

174
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:27,961
Why is that?

175
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:30,561
Because there are minors.

176
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:46,681
Choosing Alison Parker's life
over eight was her decision.

177
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,641
He told me that intelligence
would assume the consequences.

178
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:53,161
Get out there and tell the press it was you.

179
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,761
and his friends at CNI.

180
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:57,561
- Intelligence cannot make such statements.

181
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,081
But don't worry.

182
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:02,641
The Presidency is aware and has
the support of the government.

183
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:07,281
- It is brought to me
by the government's support.

184
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,161
I care what my daughter and my mother believe.

185
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:11,761
Not what the president thinks.

186
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:16,641
- Inspector, those people never thought of
letting Alison Parker go.

187
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,401
or the eight minors.

188
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:19,881
It was a trap.

189
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,921
But if you'll allow me,
I'll tell you something.

190
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:26,601
When it's all over,
no one will remember this.

191
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,761
It is...

192
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:32,081
It's like the Spanish national team.

193
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,801
It doesn't matter how the World Cup starts.

194
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:36,041
If it finally achieves a happy ending,

195
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,121
will be the heroine of the country.

196
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,521
But if you leave a rosary of corpses,

197
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:43,921
we'll all be fucked.

198
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,841
I am very sorry for my mistakes.

199
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:50,641
And I am at your entire disposal.

200
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:53,761
But if you want me to go...

201
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:02,881
- Suárez, I want everyone up and running.

202
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:06,361
I want the evidence from
the Seat Ibiza scientist now.

203
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:09,441
And the underground unit report.
What about it?

204
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,841
And above all, Mr. Prieto,

205
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:18,361
I want intelligence to tell me how the muggers
are going to get out.

206
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,121
I have a question, Profesor.

207
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,201
How are we gonna get out of there?

208
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,881
Through a tunnel.

209
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:37,401
- Is that the master plan?

210
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:39,201
The police get that in two minutes.

211
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:40,761
- Yes, I do.

212
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,081
Look.

213
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:56,121
This is the National Mint.

214
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:57,961
view from above.

215
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:00,961
Just come in,

216
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,481
you're gonna put the hostages to bite right here.

217
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,681
In the basement of boilers.

218
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:11,041
It's exactly 13 meters from the sewer.

219
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,161
At 13 meters? Uh-huh.

220
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:20,401
At that distance, we'd be detected
by any georadar.

221
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:21,961
Isn't it?

222
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:24,921
True.

223
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:29,601
A georadar has a range of about 15 meters.

224
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:34,161
And if not, they'll do it with a seismograph
capturing the vibration.

225
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:38,321
That's why they're gonna think we're
gonna elope around here.

226
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,601
But we're not going that way, are we?

227
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:45,841
No.

228
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,001
We'll go out through another tunnel.

229
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,361
A tunnel...

230
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,361
that they won't be able to see.

231
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:58,601
Because it's 26 meters
from any other conduit.

232
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:01,961
of sanitation and, above all,
because it is already done.

233
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:06,441
Just take it from vault number three.

234
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,241
¿Who made that tunnel?

235
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,721
I had it built five years ago.

236
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,001
Once you enter the tunnel from the factory,

237
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:23,361
you will find 486 meters...

238
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,401
already dug up to...

239
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,761
a hangar...

240
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,201
which I have already planned.

241
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,321
No.

242
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,801
I take off my hat.
- And the panties.

243
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,281
- But all cameras...

244
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:47,521
also have armored floor.

245
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,761
That's right.

246
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:52,001
There's a first layer of steel

247
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:53,761
and a second, reinforced concrete.

248
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:57,561
Besides, there can't be any air hammer in there.

249
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,521
It must be done by hand, thermal and radial lance.

250
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,041
How many meters?

251
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:07,321
16 centimeters of steel.

252
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,281
80 centimetres of reinforced concrete.

253
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,561
Finally, land.

254
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,721
Six meters and 70, in total.

255
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,281
- Fuck.

256
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,801
- Good hole.

257
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:25,481
- And how long does it take
you to make this hole?

258
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:31,521
- 10, 12 days.

259
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,241
- The time we'll be inside.

260
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,881
A few...

261
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:41,801
200 million euros printed per day.

262
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:47,081
<i>2400 million.</i>

263
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,681
- Yes, sir!

264
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,001
- Come on! Profesor!

265
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:55,121
Scientific confirms the presence
of ammonia and alcohol

266
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:57,041
in dashboard, upholstery, glass.

267
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:59,281
Come on, in the whole car.

268
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,641
The report reveals that those
products were applied

269
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,961
a few minutes before we arrived.

270
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:09,161
Which suggests that someone related to the gang

271
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,921
was there at about the same time as us.

272
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,161
What about the beggar?

273
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,481
No trace.

274
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,401
We've checked the traffic cams

275
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,881
and nearby shops, but nothing.

276
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,601
There is good news, though.

277
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,321
They've managed to isolate
a fingerprint on the button.

278
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:34,801
The owner has a record.
They are sending us the file.

279
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,361
- Attention, listen to me, all of you.

280
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:42,361
I need you to step out of the tent
for a few minutes.

281
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,041
All except the sub-inspector Rubio.

282
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:49,521
- It's gonna be a few minutes,
fellas, thank you very much.

283
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,761
- Thank you.

284
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,041
Least of all the CNI.

285
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,921
Do you think it was a coincidence that this guy,

286
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,401
the beggar, get to the junkyard before we do?

287
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:13,401
No, it wasn't by chance.

288
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,241
- There is a mole among us.

289
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,641
- And what are we going to do?

290
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:23,801
- Find him.

291
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,441
The police file has arrived.

292
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,761
Take it easy.

293
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,081
Take it easy.

294
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:06,361
It's all right.

295
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,001
Take it easy.

296
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,601
You rest.

297
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,801
Freeze.

298
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:17,241
Take it easy.

299
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,961
Joke.

300
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:26,441
Joke. 310.

301
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:29,081
Joke.

302
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:30,561
It's all right.

303
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,401
It's all right.

304
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,201
Joke.

305
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,161
- Ah!

306
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:55,601
- I'll be right back.

307
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:12,761
It's all right.

308
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:15,161
No infection. All right.

309
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:18,641
All right, all right.

310
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,841
37,6.

311
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,481
No problem.

312
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,921
40, problem.

313
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:36,041
37.6, no problem.

314
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,881
I, in war, take care of many men.

315
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,201
Man look after man.

316
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:46,001
No problem.

317
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,321
It's all right.

318
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,041
It's all right.

319
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,161
Mónica.

320
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:23,161
Mónica, uh.

321
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,201
How's it going?

322
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:34,681
It's better.

323
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,441
What are you doing here?

324
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,961
It's my hour of sleep, but I wanted to know how you were.

325
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:48,761
It's hot in here.

326
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,801
Yeah. Ugh!

327
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:53,001
Looks like the oxygen's missing.

328
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,281
Ugh!

329
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,121
You can rest here, I don't care.

330
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,121
Sitting on a racket is enough.

331
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,281
All right.

332
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:25,081
Yes, yes.

333
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:43,321
Andrés de Fonollosa.

334
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,121
Currently in search and seizure.

335
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,841
Jewelry stores, vans, auction houses.

336
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,161
White glove robberies.

337
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:56,281
You do not have exit visas
in your e-passport.

338
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:58,281
- He's probably got a fake one.

339
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,841
- No family or friends
are known to him either.

340
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:03,081
The usual confidants don't know who he is.

341
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,401
There is no address,
no census or registration.

342
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,681
All I can think of is
talking to your cellmate.

343
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,921
They shared seven months in Soto del Real.

344
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:14,841
- OK.

345
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,961
Order the paperwork to be brought to the tent.

346
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:19,361
- Wait, that's not all.

347
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:22,161
The most important thing is forensic psychiatry.
Shall I read you?

348
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:28,521
We're looking at a self-centered narcissist.

349
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,841
with delusions of grandeur.

350
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:37,041
I have gathered you here to tell you

351
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:39,921
a little how things are going.

352
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,081
And to silence rumors.

353
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:44,521
- Shows an absolute lack of empathy.

354
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:49,081
- I know it floats in the atmosphere
that Miss Mónica Gaztambide

355
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:52,881
is dead and that's not good.

356
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,601
Rumors generate...

357
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,641
uncertainty,

358
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:58,001
anxiety.

359
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,241
That's why I want to silence this.

360
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:07,441
Indeed, Mónica, his companion, has been executed.

361
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:12,321
- An eccentric with
tendencies to megalomania

362
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,921
which prevents him from
distinguishing evil from good.

363
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:18,801
- But I also love them

364
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:22,041
to share other news.

365
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,361
Good news.

366
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:26,441
Because the truth...

367
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,161
is that this heist...

368
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,001
it's going downwind.

369
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,121
It goes like a shot.

370
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:34,561
- He has a great sense of honor.

371
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:38,401
and a pathological need
to make a good impression.

372
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,401
Especially among strangers.

373
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,081
- That's why I want...

374
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:50,041
thank you, I have to thank you

375
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:55,121
to all those who are p
utting forth their efforts

376
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:59,161
and collaboration. Especially one person.

377
00:24:00,281 --> 00:24:01,721
Mr. Torres.

378
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,121
Mr. Torres.

379
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,121
Paco.

380
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:14,761
Paquito.

381
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:17,241
Paquito.

382
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,801
- Don Francisco Torres.

383
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:26,241
This gentleman has been
printing banknotes for 27 years.

384
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:29,361
And today, he broke his own record.

385
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,121
After 40 hours, you have printed...

386
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:33,881
Say how much you printed.

387
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:36,281
- 311 million euros.

388
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:38,841
- Say it loudly, proudly, let everyone know.

389
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,041
- 311 million.

390
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:44,961
- 311 million euros!

391
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:48,081
- EUR 311 million,

392
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,521
pimpam, pimpam.

393
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:51,201
All by himself!

394
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,801
- Well, with the help of my classmates.

395
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:55,521
- On top of that, he's humble.

396
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,521
Thank you, Mr. Torres, thank you.

397
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:59,641
Thank you all very much.

398
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:02,161
Mr. Torres, do you know what you are?

399
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:05,961
You're the kidnapped fuck of the month.

400
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:10,001
- That's right, let's give him the
applause he deserves...

401
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:12,001
Mr. Torres!

402
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,361
Let's go!

403
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:18,841
Come on, let him notice
all the love we have for him!

404
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:20,961
- You're a monster.

405
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:23,801
- Let love be noticed.
- Thank you!

406
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:26,321
- Joke.

407
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:34,441
But like good news never comes alone,

408
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,161
I would like us to receive...

409
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,681
as he deserves,

410
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:44,321
that we give him an unforgettable ovation...

411
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:46,521
Don Arturo.

412
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:50,001
The director general, who has finally
come out of danger!

413
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,201
Joke.

414
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:14,921
Thank you, Paco.

415
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:28,601
- May I speak to you privately, please?

416
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:59,241
I want you to leak everything about this
guy to the press, everything.

417
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:00,841
- What for?

418
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:03,561
- For what?
- Yes.

419
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:06,761
- That guy's doing a hell of a show.

420
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:08,321
Like in a movie.

421
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:10,161
Let's see what Spain thinks now

422
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,361
when he sees that
an eccentric is holding back

423
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,321
a lot of teenagers.
- Raquel.

424
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:17,921
I don't think the public will be won over.

425
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,481
saying the boss of the
kidnappers is an eccentric.

426
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,961
This country loves eccentrics.

427
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:24,841
You'll need something else.

428
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,121
Trafficking in women.

429
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:33,561
An almost unresolved one of pimping.

430
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,801
Something the citizenry won't forgive.

431
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,321
Don't do it.

432
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:43,121
Raquel, don't do it, don't fall so low,
don't do that.

433
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:54,201
Filter it. Pimp.

434
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:57,881
With a case open for trafficking in women
from the east.

435
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,801
Some of them, minors.

436
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:03,121
Released for collaborating with the police.

437
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:04,881
- Above, a snitch.

438
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:07,521
I like your style.

439
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,281
I'm going to the agency to
prepare everything.

440
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:17,241
- Listen to me, Raquel.
No, listen to me, Raquel.

441
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:21,761
You have it clear. Let's slander a person.

442
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,801
- To defame a person?
- Yes.

443
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:28,401
- Look, Ángel, I'm in the TV talk shows,

444
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:31,681
in the international press as the
biggest son of a bitch.

445
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:35,121
And, coincidentally, my ex-husband has taken
advantage of this moment

446
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:38,721
to ask my daughter if she wants to live with him.

447
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:42,161
Do you know what that means?

448
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,961
That he's going to take
custody of my daughter.

449
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,761
He's going to go to a judge to tell him:

450
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:52,201
"Your Honor, that son of a bitch
can't raise my daughter.

451
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,561
And besides, the girl
wants to live with me.

452
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:58,081
- A judge will not give you custody

453
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:02,441
to a guy who mistreated you.
- If my mother doesn't believe me.

454
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,241
Do you think a judge will believe me?

455
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,721
- I believe you, Raquel.

456
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:07,761
I believe you.

457
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,001
I can testify.

458
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,601
- Testify?
- Yes.

459
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:15,921
- What are you going to testify?

460
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,721
You didn't see anything.
- What the hell!

461
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,801
Aren't we going to defame Fonollosa?
Here all God is defamed.

462
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,921
Fuck! Your husband, the first.

463
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:28,921
That's it, I say I saw your cardinals.

464
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,801
Below the miniskirt, though.

465
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:36,881
- If I don't wear a miniskirt ever.

466
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,281
- It doesn't matter, dammit.

467
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:43,561
And, by the way, I declare the night
we spent in the mountains.

468
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:48,361
It wasn't in Cercedilla, it was in Miraflores.

469
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,321
- Excuse me, Inspector.

470
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:04,441
Can we?

471
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:06,721
- What's going on?

472
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:09,801
- We have come from the scrap yard.
We have interrogated the Russian.

473
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:14,601
Nikolai Dimitrevich, the watchman.

474
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:18,721
A man asked for a car an hour
before you arrived.

475
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:22,521
He spoke to him in Russian.
According to the subject's description,

476
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:25,721
could be the same person who talked to Almansa.

477
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,161
The beggar.

478
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:28,681
- Bring that Russian.

479
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,081
Have him check the Eastern criminal files.

480
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:33,641
And have him do the robot portrait.

481
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:45,481
- I want all the chips

482
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,561
of all the Russians he's ever questioned,

483
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,121
arrested or charged.

484
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:52,721
There is a software aid to make a portrait rob

485
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:56,201
"The Profesor's image was so anonymous

486
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,641
as a puzzle of 1000 pieces.

487
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:01,521
But a witness was going to put all
those pieces together.

488
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:06,001
And Raquel, who had never believed
in robot portraits,

489
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,801
was going to have the key
to the whole operation.

490
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,321
Fucking hell.

491
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:35,481
Jessica.

492
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,241
Elena.

493
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:39,241
Denise.

494
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:41,361
Paula.

495
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,881
Elisabeth.

496
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,081
Aurora.

497
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:45,721
And Alison.

498
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,161
I'm sorry I tied you so tight.

499
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:57,121
But you also pointed a rifle at my head.

500
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,841
What did you want me to do?

501
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:02,201
For the ambassador's daughter,
you're a bit of a rebel.

502
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:06,241
- Don't believe it, it's the second madness
I've done in my life.

503
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,601
- Oh, yeah, and what's the first one?

504
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:11,081
- Secretly signing up for dance.

505
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:12,761
- Fucking crazy!

506
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:15,521
You start with the dance and end up
in something nasty,

507
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:16,841
like the violin.

508
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:18,521
And then, chunda, chunda.

509
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,761
- My father has chosen everything in my life.

510
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,321
The school, the race...

511
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:34,001
To the house where I'm going
to graduate school.

512
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,121
Alison, this cutlery is fishing.

513
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:38,601
Alison, not that glass.

514
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,401
Alison, you're going into chess.

515
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,721
And so on.

516
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:46,641
- Sure.

517
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,641
And to touch his balls, you sign up for ballet.

518
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:54,321
- I got into dance because my father hates dance.

519
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,441
And volleyball was on Saturdays.

520
00:32:56,561 --> 00:33:00,201
And on Saturdays I can't do anything without him knowing.

521
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,161
- All right.

522
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:08,321
Take the toilet bag and we'll go up in single file.

523
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:21,841
Boo.

524
00:33:24,241 --> 00:33:25,481
What were you talking about?

525
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,481
You're welcome.

526
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:31,921
Something from Oxford.

527
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,201
I heard you.

528
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:36,001
No, my life.

529
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:37,681
That my father is a bossy man.

530
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,401
Are you going to invite him to the embassy?

531
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,001
Who?

532
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:46,081
To Río.

533
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:47,801
No.

534
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,441
You don't like my boyfriend?

535
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:52,961
No.

536
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,281
I love his smile.

537
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:00,601
Don't you?

538
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,041
No, I don't.

539
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,001
If I've seen you look at him,
why are you lying to me?

540
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,761
Ouch!

541
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:22,921
Isn't Río a monkey?

542
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,721
Yeah, well.

543
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,281
See how you like it?

544
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:31,481
It's all right, admit it.

545
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,121
Yes, I do.

546
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,041
Yes, he's with me.

547
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:42,161
But I'm not some rabid bitch.

548
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,601
that bites when she feels insecure.

549
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:54,321
If you like to play,

550
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:57,201
we'll all have to play.

551
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,481
Pull.

552
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,881
How long have you been in there?

553
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:11,801
Look...

554
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:15,521
I'm very worried about my student Silvia.

555
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,201
Because she's a girl...

556
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:20,201
particularly fragile.

557
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,161
And I think she'd feel a lot more protected

558
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:27,761
with the group, with their companions.

559
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:32,521
- What kind of classes
do you teach at the school?

560
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,281
- Me? Uh...
- Yes.

561
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:38,401
- Well...

562
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:41,241
Philosophy, ethics.
- Philosophy?

563
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:42,961
- Yes.
- That's good.

564
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:45,201
- History of religions.

565
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:46,761
And...

566
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:49,361
Well, also some workshops.
- Workshops of what?

567
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:54,161
- Environment, sex education.

568
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:00,681
- What an important job.

569
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,121
And since you're an expert,

570
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:10,281
maybe you can help me solve a problem

571
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:13,161
I have with this sexuality thing.

572
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:16,521
Actually, I'd like to explain a theory to you.

573
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:25,321
May I?

574
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:28,561
- Yes, of course.

575
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:29,801
Hello.

576
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,641
- I came up with the jokes.

577
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,801
- The jokes.

578
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:38,921
- The jokes.

579
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:44,241
You know that for a joke to work,

580
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:46,601
it has to have a part of truth...

581
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:48,961
and another of pain.

582
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:51,641
- Is that so? Well, I didn't...
I didn't know.

583
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:53,321
That's funny.
- Yes, it is.

584
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:54,761
That's right.

585
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,801
Do you know the one with the headache?

586
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:04,681
- No, no, no, no.

587
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:07,281
- A husband comes home.

588
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:08,921
"Honey,

589
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,041
I brought you an aspirin."

590
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:14,561
And the woman says,
"But I don't have a headache."

591
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,201
Then let's fuck.

592
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:29,081
Have you noticed

593
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,441
of the amount of jokes that portray the male

594
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,241
bent on bending the female

595
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,161
to get sex?

596
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,121
And the woman, always obliged,
as if she didn't like it.

597
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,761
What do you think is true about all this?

598
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:48,401
Don't you have the same appetites, profesor?

599
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:54,121
- I understand you do.

600
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,921
Perhaps not with the same frequency.

601
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:00,281
- Could be.

602
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:04,401
- But tell me, Silvia, can you take her...?

603
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:06,241
- Oh, of course, Silvia.

604
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:09,081
Stand up for a moment, please.

605
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:11,241
Come with me.

606
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:13,161
Come on.

607
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,841
Look, there's Silvia.

608
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:23,121
- Mmmm!
- See how quiet?

609
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:27,081
Hello!

610
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:29,721
Hello.

611
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,081
Say hello, profesor.

612
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:34,321
I'm sure the little girl is
looking forward to it.

613
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:51,841
- What is it, Nairobi?

614
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:56,001
- You're on TV.

615
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,481
- Oslo.

616
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:06,841
It's been a pleasure, Profesor.

617
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:10,241
Come back when you want,
we'll talk about ethics.

618
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:11,641
Take her away.

619
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:15,721
- Let's go.

620
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,561
Three sexual assaults,

621
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:39,841
six narcotic poisonings,

622
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:41,401
exhibitionism.

623
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,961
In total, 38 years in prison

624
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:47,361
and there's still a trial pending.

625
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:53,521
- Why did you bring me here?

626
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:01,281
- He shared a cell with that man.

627
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,081
Do you remember who you were related to?

628
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:07,721
- With no one.

629
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:10,401
- Well, he'll have a family.

630
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,201
Bride.

631
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:14,241
Couple.
- I don't know.

632
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:15,441
- Friends.

633
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,801
- He didn't mention.

634
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:21,161
- Are you telling me that in seven months,
you didn't mention anyone?

635
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:26,601
Is something wrong?

636
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:30,241
- What if something happens.

637
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:33,161
- Did he tell you about his house?

638
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:34,601
- No, I don't.

639
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:36,961
- From his neighbourhood, a village.

640
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:39,481
Somewhere I'd plan to go back.

641
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:41,481
- I don't know, he didn't say anything.

642
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:44,761
- I don't think you understand
very well how this works.

643
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:49,721
I need you to give me something.

644
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,561
Do you understand?

645
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:53,001
A thread to pull.

646
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:54,961
Please think.

647
00:41:57,961 --> 00:41:59,321
- There is one thing.

648
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:00,841
- What's that?

649
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:03,921
- I'm not just going to say it like that.

650
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,121
I've been in jail for four years.

651
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,721
I need something in return.
- Sure.

652
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,281
- Don't touch my balls.

653
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:12,241
- Ángel.
- This is not a movie.

654
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:16,001
You talk and then, we'll see,
we come to an agreement.

655
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:18,041
You sing and I'll give you a sugar.

656
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,161
Did you hear me?
- Ángel!

657
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:22,841
Take it easy.

658
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:26,881
Look.

659
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:30,881
I'm going to sign a paper requesting

660
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:33,041
to the board of Soto the third degree.

661
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:34,961
But on two conditions.

662
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:37,761
The first is that you give us the
information now.

663
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:39,681
If the information is good,

664
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,641
I will give you the second condition.

665
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:44,241
You have my word that I will get you
the third grade.

666
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:50,121
- He was injecting a drug every day.

667
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:52,721
- I have your infirmary report here.

668
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:54,721
It says nothing about any disease.

669
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:56,441
- Yeah, I know.

670
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,881
It was something he was wearing in secret.

671
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:01,481
Something degenerative.

672
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:03,721
- Do you remember the
name of the medication?

673
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:05,281
- Retroxil.

674
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:06,881
- How did you get it?

675
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,561
- I don't know if you know how easy it is
to put anything in jail.

676
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:13,721
Through the rectal cavity.

677
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:20,281
And now, tell me what the second condition is.

678
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:24,801
- That you voluntarily submit

679
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:26,841
to a chemical castration treatment.

680
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:31,201
As soon as you ask, I'll sign the third degree.

681
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:33,681
No?
- No.

682
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,721
- Suárez, take him away.

683
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:39,201
- Come on.
- He gave me his word.

684
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:40,961
Son of a bitch!

685
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,761
- Find out what the Retroxil is for.

686
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:48,441
Track any anomalous shopping patterns

687
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:49,761
in the last six months.

688
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:53,001
If that guy injects that every day,

689
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:55,641
has had to come up with a good arsenal.

690
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:57,841
All by yourself.

691
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:02,881
We can't trust anyone before we find the mole.

692
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:04,001
- All right, all right.

693
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:09,241
- I brought you the Russian, Inspector.

694
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:10,521
- Nikolai.

695
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:13,241
I sent for him.

696
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:15,721
to recognize this morning's man,

697
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:17,041
that of the scrap yard.

698
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:19,961
Do you think he'll recognize your face?

699
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,201
Can you do a robot portrait?

700
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:24,761
- Perfectly.

701
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:26,161
- Ángel.

702
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:28,961
Tell the others they can come in.

703
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,641
I think this nose.

704
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:50,281
- Almansa.

705
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:53,481
How's the robot portrait going?

706
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:55,921
- Well, he and I agree on the traits.

707
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:58,121
Soon we'll have his face.
- All right.

708
00:47:20,801 --> 00:47:22,881
"Those words threw the Profesor

709
00:47:23,001 --> 00:47:25,561
to do something he'd never imagined before.

710
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:29,721
Find the police to save your skin.

711
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,921
Fuck, what a bitch.

712
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,561
Is it still like this?

713
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:56,321
Can I help you?

714
00:47:57,321 --> 00:48:00,001
The sooner we finish, the sooner we get out,
right?

715
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,721
Are you tired of being here already?

716
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:08,201
You see.

717
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:13,361
If this bores anyone.

718
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:16,081
You're bored with 67 hostages,

719
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:19,441
firing bursts with your M-16.

720
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:21,521
and with the police on the door.

721
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:22,721
Is that it?

722
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:28,001
Is that why you threw yourself
at that little lamb's neck?

723
00:48:28,561 --> 00:48:31,401
You've started snoring at her,
scared to death.

724
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:34,681
What the hell was that for?

725
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:36,761
To provoke you.

726
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,321
Make very quiet poop...

727
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:45,601
What now?

728
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:49,561
Is Río boring you already?

729
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:56,161
Why do you say that?

730
00:48:56,281 --> 00:48:58,121
Because you're that kind of person.

731
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:00,361
Is that so?

732
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:04,201
What kind of person?

733
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:11,121
The kind you don't want for your child.

734
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:14,601
Remember in Toledo, the day of the paella?

735
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:16,321
It was St. John's night.

736
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:18,681
You escaped to the verbena.

737
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:21,041
Yes, it is.

738
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:30,841
Whoa!

739
00:49:35,281 --> 00:49:36,561
What's going on?

740
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:38,481
What is it? What?

741
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:53,281
What?

742
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:57,841
Did you know there are over 2,000
billion stars?

743
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:02,641
What's the matter, you've counted them? Of course.

744
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:05,881
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

745
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:13,681
Here, I need a little party.

746
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:15,961
And I know, Tokio,

747
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,281
that in your room you have something like this.

748
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:20,801
Something. From lost, to the river.

749
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:22,481
Oh, Río!

750
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:24,121
Oh, Río!

751
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:26,041
Río, how drunk I was.

752
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:28,281
Very drunk.

753
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:42,201
Can I have a puff?

754
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:48,281
Hey.

755
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:53,121
Why did you tell me about the stars before?

756
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:57,241
I don't know, man, 'cause it's pretty.

757
00:50:57,361 --> 00:51:00,161
All the stars in there, like...

758
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:01,761
In the middle of the mountain.

759
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:03,321
I don't know, man.

760
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,721
That's it?

761
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,361
Nothing more than what?

762
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,961
I don't know what...

763
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:12,521
Maybe you wanted to say something else.

764
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:17,241
Like you wanted to fuck me or something?

765
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:23,081
But would you like it?

766
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:27,521
Get off, man. Fuck it!

767
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:29,161
Dad...

768
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,561
Dad, what are you doing there?

769
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:34,961
- Nothing, I was there and you weren't...

770
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:38,441
Where do you come from at this hour and so on?

771
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:39,521
Joke.

772
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:42,921
We come from the verbena.
Come on, the other one.

773
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:46,281
The verbena.
- Did you get out of here?

774
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:48,521
- What are we going to get out!
Don't lie.

775
00:51:48,641 --> 00:51:51,161
We have remained of botellón.
Go to the bed.

776
00:51:51,281 --> 00:51:52,521
- I've already revealed myself.

777
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,681
And since I've been awake,
I'm going to have a little drink.

778
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,561
- You take the dream with nothing.

779
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:00,641
Dad, look at me.

780
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:02,121
Go to the bed.

781
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:04,161
Go to the bed. Listen to me.

782
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:06,841
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Fucking hell!

783
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,681
Here, smoke. While we're at it.

784
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:10,401
Take this one. Come on.

785
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:12,961
I go to the bathroom. When I get back,
each of you, to your little room.

786
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:14,201
Come on.

787
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:16,721
Let's see if we sleep a little bit.
See you later, gorgeous.

788
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:18,481
- Man!

789
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:20,761
Can't you see I'm doing this to you with my eyes...

790
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:22,401
for you to leave?

791
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:23,681
- Why?

792
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:25,921
- Because you cut me off.

793
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:28,881
- Tokio and you...?

794
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:30,121
- Yes, there.

795
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:32,361
- Man, it's good.
- Good?

796
00:52:32,481 --> 00:52:34,561
She's hot, Dad.

797
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:36,641
- But you'll have time.

798
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:38,481
You have to concentrate.

799
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:40,401
- I haven't been more focused on my life.

800
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:43,241
- What you have to concentrate on.
Let's go to bed.

801
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:45,761
- Fuck I'm going to sleep with you now

802
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:48,121
after I almost lay with that goddess.

803
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:50,001
I'm going to sleep in the damn car.

804
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:52,401
- How are you going to get to the car?
- Shut up, shut up.

805
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,681
You're always doing the same fucking thing to me,
you're always doing the same thing to me.

806
00:53:06,161 --> 00:53:08,201
What's the matter, I'm too little for your son?

807
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:12,081
I think you're too much.

808
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:14,921
Because you live life like a video game.

809
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:17,401
Muggings, shootings, lovers.

810
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:20,761
Adventures.

811
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:24,721
Well, yeah, I like to live.

812
00:53:24,841 --> 00:53:25,801
No.

813
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:29,481
You like to jump from stone to stone in puddles.

814
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:32,401
Every step of your way, a stone sinks.

815
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:36,281
You're leaving corpses on the verges.

816
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:38,161
That's what you like.

817
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:45,801
Who came up with the armored car heist?

818
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,361
You, right?

819
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:52,801
Well, now, your boyfriend's a corpse.

820
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:56,001
And so is your mother.

821
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:59,401
I'm sure you were aware of the damage
you were doing to your mother.

822
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:02,881
And now it's Río's turn.

823
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:05,841
You're bored already.

824
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:10,881
And on top of that,
you reach for a girl at gunpoint.

825
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:13,321
Unconscious.

826
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:17,161
Capricious, superficial, selfish.

827
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:20,241
How do you define yourself?

828
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:27,321
If we all do our jobs and it goes wrong,

829
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:29,801
is part of the job.

830
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:33,641
But if it goes wrong because
a capricious little girl

831
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:37,401
wants to rush out of here, I won't allow it.

832
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:41,081
So get to work. We only have 10 days left.

833
00:54:42,441 --> 00:54:45,561
Let's see if you'll ever
finish what you started.

834
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,121
"Known to perpetrate numerous robberies

835
00:55:01,241 --> 00:55:03,041
to jewelry stores and luxury establishments,

836
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:07,241
Fonollosa is also attributed with other
crimes of a sexual nature."

837
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:08,761
- What a résumé!

838
00:55:09,321 --> 00:55:11,561
Andrés de Fonollosa.

839
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:13,801
Who'd have thought?

840
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:16,001
With that finesse you have.

841
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:19,601
And that stick that looks like you've
been shoved up your ass.

842
00:55:19,721 --> 00:55:22,041
And in the end, what you're into are whores.

843
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:26,441
"Belonging to a trafficking network of women

844
00:55:26,561 --> 00:55:28,761
that they brought from Albania and Bulgaria

845
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:30,881
to be subsequently sold..."

846
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:35,321
- Did you also taste Bulgarians before you sold them?

847
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,441
"Crimes of pimping, extortion of minors,

848
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:40,601
deprivation of liberty..."
- Minors?

849
00:55:40,721 --> 00:55:42,441
Minors?

850
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:44,081
Minors.

851
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:47,641
"Among them, the attempted assault on a
well-known jewelry store."

852
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,201
- You're a pig.

853
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:53,441
What's the point of having that little
girl tied up in your office?

854
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:54,881
Huh?

855
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:58,401
What are you trying to do,
you piece of scum?

856
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:01,921
"Andrés de Fonollosa would have eluded

857
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:04,721
this last charge thanks to his collaboration
as a confidant."

858
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:08,441
On top of that, you're a snitch.

859
00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:11,321
"Identified by the police next to..."

860
00:56:11,441 --> 00:56:13,161
- Ah!

861
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,841
- I would never sell to women.

862
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,841
And much less, I'd be his pimp.

863
00:56:23,961 --> 00:56:25,801
My code of ethics prevents me from doing so.

864
00:56:25,921 --> 00:56:29,641
How does it prevent me from betraying a companion,
even if it is a spoil.

865
00:56:32,961 --> 00:56:36,601
And that has nothing to do with my
tastes and hobbies.

866
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:40,121
- If you say so.

867
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,281
Ah!

868
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:51,681
"Fonollosa's footprint has been found

869
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:53,881
on a button that the agents found

870
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:56,241
in a Seat Ibiza linked to the investigation.

871
00:56:57,521 --> 00:56:59,321
Special units..."

872
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:01,321
- I've never been in that car before.

873
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:07,441
But I do know someone who did.

874
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,481
What's going on?

875
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:46,721
- What the fuck are you doing with my jacket,
mamarracho?

876
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:48,201
- Fucking hell, man.

877
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:51,041
Holy shit.

878
00:57:52,321 --> 00:57:54,881
Tell me, Nairobi, do you know where Denver is?

879
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:57,001
- No. No.

880
00:58:07,761 --> 00:58:09,641
I've sobered up, man, fuck.

881
00:58:11,641 --> 00:58:13,401
Yeah, I was gonna wake you up now.

882
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:15,121
Have I been here long?

883
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,441
I don't know.

884
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:20,881
The first time I've ever slept with a girl

885
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:22,961
and when I wake up, she's still there.

886
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:25,361
I don't know where you wanted me to go.
Huh?

887
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:28,001
I don't know where you wanted me to go.

888
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:30,401
Shot in the leg and in the middle
of a kidnapping.

889
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:32,361
I don't have many options.

890
00:58:32,481 --> 00:58:33,721
What's the matter with you?

891
00:58:33,841 --> 00:58:36,481
You don't have to be so rude,
I saved your life.

892
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:39,321
You saved my life? How?

893
00:58:39,441 --> 00:58:42,121
Like the Jews of Auschwitz?

894
00:58:42,241 --> 00:58:44,961
A Nazi took him out of line and he
didn't go to the gas chamber.

895
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:47,601
I'm not a fucking Nazi,
I'm not a fucking Nazi.

896
00:58:48,121 --> 00:58:50,521
I remind you that you put a cell
phone in your panties,

897
00:58:50,641 --> 00:58:52,521
that I was sent to kill you.
And what did you do?

898
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:54,041
Hey, what did you do?

899
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,641
Did you tell him no,
did you stop him? No.

900
00:58:56,761 --> 00:58:58,681
You shot me in the leg.

901
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,841
You humiliated me in front of everyone.

902
00:59:00,961 --> 00:59:04,601
And now, you've got me locked up here,
I can't breathe or go to the bathroom.

903
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:06,401
I do my needs in a bucket.

904
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:08,761
So don't get confused.

905
00:59:09,681 --> 00:59:11,921
You may be the best of the Nazis.

906
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,841
But you're still one of them.

907
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:20,601
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

908
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:23,201
Sorry, no...

909
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:25,721
I didn't mean to humiliate you.

910
00:59:26,561 --> 00:59:29,721
I don't know what to do with all this either.

911
00:59:33,241 --> 00:59:36,241
I'm gonna take you to the bathroom.
Is that okay?

912
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:38,521
Okay.

913
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:41,321
All right, let's go.

914
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:21,641
Denver!

915
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:27,921
My friend!

916
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,121
Come here!

917
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:33,481
- Ouch!

918
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:34,841
Wait!

919
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:37,521
Stop it!

920
01:01:37,641 --> 01:01:39,601
Wait, damn it, Berlín!

921
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:43,481
Wait, stop, stop, you're right!

922
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:45,081
You're right.

923
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:49,601
Maybe Denver lost a button on your jacket.

924
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:52,361
because he put on your jacket, but so what?

925
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:54,081
You can't change it.

926
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:55,601
- But I can punish him.

927
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:57,681
- Berlín.

928
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:02,761
He's not resting. Not in museum.

929
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:04,801
Not even in a tunnel.

930
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,121
Not even in print.

931
01:02:07,241 --> 01:02:08,921
- Has he gone to the verbena again?

932
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:12,961
Don't worry, guys, I'll get it.

933
01:02:13,081 --> 01:02:15,281
- Berlín, please, come to your senses.

934
01:02:15,401 --> 01:02:16,921
Come to your senses.

935
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:20,041
You can't shoot him because he stole
your jacket.

936
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:21,521
It's a botched job.

937
01:02:21,641 --> 01:02:23,721
You're a classy guy and that's a mess.

938
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:25,841
- And what about my dignity?
- Huh?

939
01:02:28,241 --> 01:02:30,681
- I have a reputation to uphold.

940
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:34,241
My friends from the Côte d'Azur
have seen...

941
01:02:34,401 --> 01:02:36,721
my name associated with those infamies.

942
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:39,401
Denver screwed up my honor.

943
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:41,361
And if anyone fucks up my honor,

944
01:02:41,961 --> 01:02:43,161
I crush him.

945
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,521
We're talking about integrity.

946
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:50,321
Huh?

947
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:54,161
Ethics is important, Nairobi.

948
01:02:54,281 --> 01:02:55,721
But also, aesthetics.

949
01:02:56,841 --> 01:02:58,681
- I'm asking you please.

950
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:02,761
Please don't fuck with our plan, Berlín.

951
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:06,201
You fucking bastard!

952
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:07,761
- Hey, hey, hey.

953
01:03:10,401 --> 01:03:11,721
Nairobi.

954
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:14,201
It's here.
- Helsinki.

955
01:03:14,681 --> 01:03:16,441
Are you going to shoot me?

956
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:22,681
- Stay here.

957
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,841
- It was a fucking joke about the jacket.

958
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:28,801
It was a fucking joke about the jacket!

959
01:03:31,001 --> 01:03:32,161
It was a joke!

960
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:38,321
I don't know if I'm overdoing it a little
bit with my lip.

961
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:40,321
I'm a bit of a whore anyway.
What do you think?

962
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,641
I, on the other hand, I'm going supersimple.

963
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:45,161
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you.

964
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:47,761
Where are we going? To the verbena.

965
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:51,441
Then you'll have to go as a whore verbenero.

966
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:54,801
What is it? Let's party.

967
01:03:54,921 --> 01:03:56,161
Shhh.

968
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:58,761
The Profesor's keys? Here.

969
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:03,081
Holy shit!

970
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:08,321
Mmm!

971
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:10,601
- Where is Denver?
- I don't know.

972
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,121
What do you mean you don't know?

973
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:14,841
- Yes, sir, now, yes.

974
01:04:14,961 --> 01:04:16,961
Shut up.

975
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:19,121
- But what is this?

976
01:04:19,241 --> 01:04:20,761
Pure and hard elegance.

977
01:04:20,881 --> 01:04:22,721
The Berlín jacket?
Yes, sir.

978
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:25,281
We're going, we're going.

979
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:28,841
Silence, silence, silence.

980
01:04:28,961 --> 01:04:31,001
Silence, it comes to me...

981
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,401
What do you say?

982
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:36,361
Did I ever tell you about my five women?

983
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:39,521
- Shhh.

984
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:42,841
They just want us to fertilize them, but later,

985
01:04:42,961 --> 01:04:45,201
what comes out of there...

986
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:48,201
is a nuclear warhead.

987
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:51,121
- I'm getting nervous!

988
01:04:56,321 --> 01:04:57,801
Meow.

989
01:04:57,921 --> 01:04:59,441
You look very pretty.

990
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:02,121
I've put on manga for you.
I like manga.

991
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:29,521
What's the matter with you?

992
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:31,761
You cried.

993
01:05:33,201 --> 01:05:34,801
How do you think I am?

994
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:37,081
Fucking awesome.

995
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,321
I think I'm a weather vane
that ends up fucking everybody.

996
01:05:43,561 --> 01:05:46,121
It's like I'm in a movie.

997
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:47,961
As if he didn't recognize me.

998
01:05:50,121 --> 01:05:51,601
Because I thought I was...

999
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:53,881
different,

1000
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,001
but actually, I'm a crazy bitch who hurts.

1001
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,641
And who gets tired of everything.

1002
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:05,161
And it doesn't make people happy.

1003
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:11,001
I don't like the way I am.

1004
01:06:14,161 --> 01:06:17,361
And I don't like this shitty book I found either.

1005
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:20,761
He says I'm a toxic woman.

1006
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,481
If you're trying to leave me,
walk away or something,

1007
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:29,961
don't even try.

1008
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:34,321
Río, man,

1009
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,641
I am scorched earth.

1010
01:06:40,401 --> 01:06:41,721
Worse.

1011
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:45,241
I'm a fucking gas can and a match.

1012
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:47,921
Well, I love bonfires.

1013
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:50,961
And if you're toxic, I get dizzy.

1014
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:54,001
Like with a joint and I enjoy it.

1015
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:56,401
Look.

1016
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:01,001
When I see you on the other side of the museum,

1017
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:03,001
I feel like crying

1018
01:07:04,081 --> 01:07:06,081
for the simple fact of being with you.

1019
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:10,641
And we fuck and I float around the room.

1020
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:21,481
I already know you'll leave me.

1021
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:25,561
But why don't we hold out a little longer?

1022
01:07:25,681 --> 01:07:27,401
Does it have to be now?

1023
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:34,961
No, it doesn't have to be now.

1024
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:43,961
Record.

1025
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:35,601
And this hair.
- Perfect.

1026
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:51,121
Z-75, all units.

1027
01:08:51,241 --> 01:08:54,641
We have an armed robbery in Alcántara, 33.

1028
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:56,441
Any units nearby?

1029
01:08:56,561 --> 01:08:59,321
Z-32, we're right at the door,
we're on our way.

1030
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:09,361
That's him.

1031
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:12,441
Yes.

1032
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:13,681
I'm sure.

1033
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:19,521
- Why doesn't he pick up the phone?
Where the hell is he?

1034
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:33,881
I'm in front of your daughter's school, Karina.

1035
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:39,081
And people from my organization are in Krostoma.

1036
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:44,281
watching your wife leave the supermarket.

1037
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:48,001
If the portrait you're making

1038
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:50,361
it looks like me,

1039
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:53,361
you'll never see

1040
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:54,601
either one of them.

1041
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:56,801
Who the fuck is broadcasting from channel 8?

1042
01:09:56,921 --> 01:10:01,841
The police can't protect you, Nikolai

1043
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:06,401
Drop that, drop that!

1044
01:10:06,521 --> 01:10:08,161
Let go...!
- Fuck!

1045
01:10:08,281 --> 01:10:09,801
- Drop it!

1046
01:10:09,921 --> 01:10:12,801
What the fuck did he say?
What the fuck did he say?

1047
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:13,921
- I didn't hear anything.

1048
01:10:15,121 --> 01:10:16,601
- What did he say?

1049
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:20,681
- Where did you get that
message in Russian?

1050
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:23,041
- From Z-32.

1051
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,761
- Z-32, do you copy?

1052
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:29,921
- Z-32, leaving a hardware store.

1053
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:31,561
False notice of theft.

1054
01:10:31,681 --> 01:10:34,401
- Someone is in your car.
Go running to the unit.

1055
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:39,321
- Dispatch, someone has entered our car,

1056
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:41,001
but there's no one there anymore.

1057
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:42,561
- He's still got to be around.

1058
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:44,401
Look for a suspect.

1059
01:10:44,521 --> 01:10:46,321
Male, 40 years old, with a beard.

1060
01:10:50,001 --> 01:10:51,601
- There's no one around.

1061
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:53,441
We get moving.

1062
01:10:58,121 --> 01:10:59,441
Denver!

1063
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:03,881
Denver?

1064
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:08,281
Denver.

1065
01:11:09,801 --> 01:11:11,361
I was looking for you.

1066
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:13,001
- Here I am.

1067
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:19,761
- It turns out that...

1068
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:23,401
my face doesn't stop appearing on the news.

1069
01:11:24,521 --> 01:11:26,001
Do you know what they say about me?

1070
01:11:26,121 --> 01:11:29,481
- No.
- That I'm a thief.

1071
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:33,241
So far, so good, but they also say

1072
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:35,201
I'm a bitch lover,

1073
01:11:35,321 --> 01:11:38,641
a pimp who abused children.

1074
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,761
And all at because of a button.

1075
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:43,841
A button on my jacket.

1076
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:46,361
Do you remember? The one you wore.

1077
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:52,001
Apparently, you left it abandoned
in Toledo's car.

1078
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:53,801
A car to which I, I'm sure,

1079
01:11:54,761 --> 01:11:56,361
I never got on it.

1080
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:59,081
Do you know what that means?

1081
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:00,521
- I don't know.

1082
01:12:00,641 --> 01:12:02,201
- Yes, you do.
- I don't know.

1083
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:04,041
- That you just fucked up my life.

1084
01:12:04,161 --> 01:12:05,161
- Come on.

1085
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:07,401
- What do I do with you?

1086
01:12:07,521 --> 01:12:08,681
- Berlín.

1087
01:12:10,401 --> 01:12:12,801
- I'm sorry, I didn't notice the
fucking button.

1088
01:12:12,921 --> 01:12:15,801
I'll make it up to you with 10 or
15 million of mine.

1089
01:12:15,921 --> 01:12:17,961
You think so?
- 15 million?

1090
01:12:18,081 --> 01:12:19,521
- 15 million, don't fuck with me.

1091
01:12:19,641 --> 01:12:22,441
We're going to go fuck ourselves.
15 million.

1092
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:25,081
- 15 million euros.
- I'll sign it, if you want.

1093
01:12:26,121 --> 01:12:28,081
- For a button?
- For a button.

1094
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:31,121
- Leave him, Berlín.
- What's going on here?

1095
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:32,641
- Nothing's going on.

1096
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:35,521
- It's funny.

1097
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:38,121
It came with the idea

1098
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:41,801
to put a shot in his foot to compensate

1099
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:45,041
and I'm getting the urge to put a bullet
in your head.

1100
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:46,801
and I don't know why.

1101
01:12:55,201 --> 01:12:56,921
- Berlín.

1102
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:59,121
- Shhh.

1103
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:11,201
Thank you.

1104
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,161
- Retroxil. It is a rare medicine,
ordered on request.

1105
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:31,841
Used to palliate tremors

1106
01:13:31,961 --> 01:13:34,201
of a rare degenerative neuronal disease.

1107
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,361
- How?

1108
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:38,161
- Herbert's myopathy.

1109
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:43,161
The Russians took this drug four years
ago and it was successful.

1110
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:45,601
They've managed to make Fonollosa's disease

1111
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,001
pass from kill to those who suffer it

1112
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:49,601
that they only palm nine out of ten.

1113
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:54,801
So if Fonollosa is not that one,

1114
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:57,521
in less than 24 months, he'll be dead.

1115
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:05,841
- That man has nothing to lose.

1116
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:32,601
- No need to...

1117
01:14:45,121 --> 01:14:46,361
Denver.

1118
01:14:49,201 --> 01:14:50,401
Denver, is that you?

1119
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:22,481
I sent you to kill her on a Friday.

1120
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:25,241
And today is Sunday.

1121
01:15:30,441 --> 01:15:32,401
Resurrection Sunday!

1122
01:15:38,481 --> 01:15:40,321
Praise the Lord.

1123
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,081
Proceed!

1124
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,521
I'm Alison Parker and I'm fucking awesome.

1125
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:03,161
Don't fuck with me!

1126
01:16:05,401 --> 01:16:07,721
I have a good surprise for you.

1127
01:16:11,121 --> 01:16:12,361
Hello, son.

1128
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:14,881
- Everything can be reversed, sweetheart.

1129
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:16,241
Think about it.

1130
01:16:16,361 --> 01:16:19,721
- If Hannibal gives himself up, it means
our plan works.

1131
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:25,281
I can help you solve your problems.

1132
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:28,761
You can change your destiny.

1133
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:31,601
You don't want to be the big heroine
of the paper house.

1134
01:16:34,681 --> 01:16:36,121
You mother fucker!

1135
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:37,321
Alison!

1136
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:41,201
The Valencia plan is activated.
Now.

1137
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:44,881
Quite a beach bar you've got here.

1138
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:49,921
I have scissors.

1139
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:51,641
Give them to me.

1140
01:16:53,281 --> 01:16:55,441
I have to get out to avoid a massacre.

1141
01:16:55,561 --> 01:16:56,841
Sit down!

1142
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:00,721
Alison!

1143
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:04,521
Assault units, stand by.

1144
01:17:04,641 --> 01:17:05,841
Four minutes.

1145
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:14,041
Fire!
