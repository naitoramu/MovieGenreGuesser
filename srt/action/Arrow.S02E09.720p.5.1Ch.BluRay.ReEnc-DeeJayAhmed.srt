1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,680
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,201
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,362
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,082
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,006
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,763
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,645
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,281
Previously on Arrow

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,051
I'm Barry Allen.
From the Central City Police Department

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,994
I'm with the Crime Scene
Investigation Unit.

11
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,344
I have friends that can help.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,444
This Miracle could kill you.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,764
It was a serum designed
to create human weapons.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,564
You think someone found the recipe?

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,004
A centrifuge and a large supply of blood.
I think someone wants to make more of it.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,810
- Oliver!
- Is he alive?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,729
- We can't save him.
- Right, we can't.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,006
Please save my friend.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,887
- Hold him.
- He's not gonna make it.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,327
He will. We just have find out
what's in his system.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,966
I... I usually only work on dead people.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,760
Barry.

23
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:12,746
Alright, I can think of
four possible diagnoses...

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,201
for what's causing his body
to react this way.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,123
Make that three possible diagnoses.

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,167
Two.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,408
Start chest compressions.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,161
I need to get to his arm.

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,086
Got it. He's suffering from
intravenous coagulation.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,209
- What?
- His blood is unnaturally clotting.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,606
It's like maple syrup.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,962
You can save him, right?

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,770
All right.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,206
Lucky you guys have a rat problem.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,006
- Are you kidding? That'll kill him.
- He dies if I don't.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,808
- Felicity...
- Do it.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,843
Ok, just the right amount
of this stuff will thin

38
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:02,710
his blood enough to get
it circulating again.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,445
Let go, Oliver.

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,608
He's crashing.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,806
Don't fight anymore.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,331
Oliver, stay with me.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,960
Stay with me.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,485
- Oliver, let him go.
- Oliver.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,011
What the hell's going on?

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,488
You were injected with a strong-acting
blood coagulant.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,648
You would've stroked out. Ahem.

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,730
But fortunately, you had a very effective
blood thinner handy.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,646
Warfarin, better known as rat poison.

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,961
Kid saved your life, Oliver.

51
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:02,107
This is the point in a
life-saving emergency...

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,641
where you thank the person
that did the life saving.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,327
- You told him who I am.
- Yeah, I did.

54
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,369
That's not your secret to tell, Felicity.

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,928
I decide who finds out my identity.

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,201
Well, we didn't have time to get your vote
what with you unconscious and dying.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,164
What happens if he leaves here
and goes right to the police?

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,203
- He wouldn't do that.
- I wouldn't do that.

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,447
- I trust him.
- I don't.

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,361
What are you gonna do,
put an arrow in him?

61
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:27,369
I'm considering it.

62
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,603
Don't worry, he's kidding. How is this any
different from when your mother shot you...

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,280
- and you came to me for help?
- Your mother shot you?

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,960
Or when you brought Dig here
when he was poisoned with Curare?

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,681
Well, the difference is that
I did my homework on both of you!

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,042
I don't just tell people easily.

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,044
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,288
And you don't have to
thank me, but you should

69
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,150
thank her instead of
being kind of a jerk.

70
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,730
Mr. Queen.

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,481
I have to go home.

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,449
The man that I fought in the bunker...

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,287
he has what he needs to mass-produce
the serum from the island.

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,802
And we have to stop him.

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,607
Yeah.

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,087
He touched your skin
when he grabbed your neck.

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,130
I was able to absorb the residual oils
from his skin, which...

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,081
when added to a gel-based polymer,
might be able to re-create his fingerprint.

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,766
Never meet your heroes, right?

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,685
Mom?

81
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,890
Thank you for coming home, sweetheart.

82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,889
- Is everything all right?
- I don't know.

83
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,289
Your sister has locked herself in her room
and she won't talk to me.

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,687
- Don't worry, I'll talk to her.
- Okay.

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,206
It's Christmas.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,885
Yes.

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,562
But given the last gala that we threw...

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,843
I think we're gonna skip
this year's Christmas party.

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,609
Thea, it's Ollie. Open the door.

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,404
Not now, Ollie.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,206
- Speedy, open the door.
- Is Mom with you?

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,645
No.

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,091
- What's going on?
- I didn't want Mom to see.

94
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,850
See what?

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,847
What happened to him?

96
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,647
The vigilante decided to use him
as target practice.

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,969
You're right, the guy's a psycho.

98
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

99
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,488
In this city, an arrow's the same as
a bullet if you want the cops involved.

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,889
Mom actually likes Roy,
but something tells me

101
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:57,028
she'd revoke his
tree-trimming invitation...

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,409
if she found out
he was messing around with the Hood.

103
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,886
Uh-huh.

104
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,530
Hi.

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,971
Roy...

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,125
this is gonna hurt.

107
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,810
My anger is dulling the pain.

108
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,446
This'll dull it better.

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,644
Put pressure on it right there.

110
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,411
Diggle, I need you to come
to the Queen mansion.

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,768
Roy's been shot...

112
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,207
with an arrow.

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,201
It's a long story.

114
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,121
Look, just bring the first-aid kit
to Thea's room.

115
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,370
Thank you.

116
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,725
Roy, my driver, Mr. Diggle...

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,571
...he has medical training from his time
in the army. He's gonna patch you up.

118
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,728
- Thank you.
- It's the least I can do.

119
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,400
Look, I don't know
what the three of you are up to...

120
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,486
but maybe the vigilante was
just trying to keep you safe.

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,489
By shooting Roy?

122
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
I...

123
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,001
I'm just saying...

124
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,682
maybe you should let this go.

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,931
So are we gonna let this go?

126
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,929
No.

127
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,040
But now we're gonna do things my way.

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,247
Mom?

129
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,967
Hello?

130
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,607
Shado?

131
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,561
You can't be here.

132
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,283
I had to see you.

133
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,086
- Had to warn you.
- Warn me?

134
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,965
You can't fight what's coming.

135
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,648
Put down your bow.

136
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,164
- Take off my father's hood.
- I wear that hood to honor your father.

137
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,170
- To honor you.
- If you want to honor me...

138
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,722
stop fighting and live.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,207
Or everyone you love will die.

140
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,011
Ollie?

141
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,287
Who were you talking to?

142
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,201
Drop your weapons!

143
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,963
Get over there.

144
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,967
Mirakuru.

145
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,127
Take them.

146
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,448
Anthony...

147
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,162
you got what you wanted.

148
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,362
You can let them go.

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,125
If you ever cared about me...

150
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,130
But I do care about you, Sara.

151
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,522
Which is why I won't choose to kill you.

152
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,170
But he might.

153
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,366
What are you talking about?

154
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,888
Time to choose, Oliver.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,207
Who lives and who dies.

156
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,323
But pick quickly,
because in 30 seconds...

157
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,160
I will shoot them both.

158
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,361
The incubation process has begun.

159
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,002
The serum will be ready for distribution
in 48 hours.

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,963
Two days.

161
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,362
And we will be able to create
a hundred more like you.

162
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,648
And the people who run this city
will see what real power looks like.

163
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,282
- I knew the vigilante had partners.
- He likes to be called the Arrow now.

164
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,370
You three have messed
with some really nasty people.

165
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,485
I mean, the Dollmaker,
Count Vertigo, Dodger...

166
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,570
- the Huntress.
- We weren't keeping score.

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,246
- I was.
- Barry.

168
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,043
The rat poison that you gave me,
are there any side effects?

169
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,246
Um, yeah, I think hallucinations, maybe.

170
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,405
And excessive sweating.
Are you sweating excessively?

171
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,171
You're hallucinating? What are you seeing?

172
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,450
A girl named Shado
that was with me on the island.

173
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,887
Shado. Sara.

174
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,327
How many women were you marooned with?

175
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,090
Sure this wasn't Fantasy Island?

176
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,444
You did train in a jungle or forest
environment. Hence the green.

177
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,330
Hey, let me draw some blood, see what's up.

178
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,727
Hey, can I ask you something?

179
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,891
Why no mask?

180
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,324
Not to tell you how to
do your vigilante-ing...

181
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,882
but the grease paint thing...

182
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,810
it's a poor identity concealer.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,304
So find me a mask that conforms
perfectly to my face and

184
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:01,552
doesn't affect my ability to
aim while I'm on the run.

185
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,927
You should look into
a compressible micro fabric.

186
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,481
- It could be great.
- I found Cyrus Gold.

187
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,761
Who's Cyrus Gold?

188
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,406
The human weapon that left
you nearly dead the other night.

189
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,967
The kid did manage to pull his print
off your neck.

190
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,528
I've had facial recognition software scanning
close circuit cameras all over town.

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,964
He's at the corner of Delgado and 25th right
now, but we're just about to lose him.

192
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,404
- What else is at that intersection?
- A parking lot, a market, a motel...

193
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,090
Could be where he's holed up.

194
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,567
- I got this.
- Oliver.

195
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,889
Why don't you let me handle this one?

196
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,846
- It's just recon.
- Fine.

197
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,042
But I'm going as your backup.

198
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,406
Don't worry...

199
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,843
- I'll figure out what's wrong with Oliver.
- You'd be the first.

200
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,451
Heh.

201
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,804
Secret admirer?

202
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,361
No, actually, they're from my father.

203
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,169
- What brings you by?
- We need your help.

204
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,048
Cindy's friend was murdered,
but the police aren't going to investigate.

205
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,163
They said that he OD'd, end of story.

206
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,601
Check this out.

207
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,169
He earned extra money donating blood.
We found it in Max's apartment.

208
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,601
They wouldn't accept his blood
if he was using, right?

209
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,202
Max went missing the same day
as the blood drive.

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,445
If he did donate blood there, maybe they at
least know something that happened to him.

211
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,041
- I'll ask around.
- Thank you, Laurel.

212
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,211
You get bored, I keep a book of
crossword puzzles in the glove box.

213
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,761
That's not funny.

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,126
Okay, what do you see?

215
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,367
It's clean. Really clean.

216
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,650
- Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday
Christened on Tuesday

217
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,731
I know the poem.
It symbolizes the seven stages of life...

218
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,083
- from birth to death.
- What stage is this guy in?

219
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,369
Go, go, go!

220
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,050
He picked me up like I was nothing.

221
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,000
- Felicity, call for backup.
- On it.

222
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,322
This about Sara?

223
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,285
You heard from her?

224
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,565
No. I'm sorry, this is...

225
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,690
This is something else.

226
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,247
Cyrus Gold.

227
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,762
He robbed the Applied Science division
of Queen Consolidated last week.

228
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,643
Detective...

229
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,444
he's extremely dangerous.

230
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,287
The CSI kid from Central City...

231
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,380
...he said this guy was
like some kind of monster.

232
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:22,024
He is.

233
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,885
- What is it, steroids?
- Worse, it's...

234
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,165
it's...

235
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,971
Look, assuming I believe you,
why come to me?

236
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,806
I've been compromised.

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,526
- What does that mean?
- It means I'd be a liability.

238
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,371
You have to take my word
on this, detective.

239
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,005
Gather as many men as you can.

240
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,043
And do not hesitate to kill Cyrus Gold...

241
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,562
because if given the opportunity,
he'll do the same to you.

242
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,088
You don't have to do this.
You got what you came for.

243
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,651
Just take it and go!

244
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,524
- Ten seconds.
- You fricking psychopath!

245
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,007
History will make that judgment.

246
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,322
Five seconds.

247
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,121
Time's up.

248
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,641
Wait, no, no!

249
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,686
I guess you made your choice.

250
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,251
No!

251
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,764
- Hi.
- Hi.

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,566
- What are you doing here?
- I came by to see Thea.

253
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,401
Oh. Come on in.

254
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,206
She's upstairs in her room.

255
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,840
I noticed on the drive up that your house
wasn't festooned with Christmas decorations.

256
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,766
Well, we didn't feel very much
like festooning this year.

257
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,281
I know what you mean.

258
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,888
I remember last Christmas...

259
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,129
Tommy and I came here for your party.

260
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,442
It was one of the best holidays
I'd had in a really long time.

261
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,085
Anyway, I should probably go talk to Thea.

262
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,366
I checked into the blood drive
and it's all legitimate.

263
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,605
In fact, what Sebastian's done
has helped save a lot of lives.

264
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,773
So if the blood drive
is on the up and up,

265
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:35,954
then how are we supposed
to find Max's killer?

266
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,963
There is one other thing.

267
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,009
All of the blood donors at the drive...

268
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,961
were subjected to a psych evaluation
by the Langford Institute.

269
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,169
Is that, like, legal?

270
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,488
It's not entirely out of the norm.

271
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,889
And while someone at the institute
might know if Max was on drugs...

272
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,841
there's no way of finding out
without a warrant.

273
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,963
Which we're certainly not going to get.

274
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,364
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

275
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,889
What are you doing?

276
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,651
Uh, just messing around with something.

277
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,322
Shouldn't you be trying to figure out
what's causing Oliver's hallucinations?

278
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,007
The sample's still being scanned.
Shouldn't be too much longer.

279
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,006
Good.

280
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,049
You're really worried about him, huh?

281
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,328
He takes crazy chances...

282
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,888
even when he's not hallucinating
about beautiful island girls.

283
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,043
Mm. Heh.

284
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,246
The other night I asked you
if you liked Oliver.

285
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,489
I told you, I don't.

286
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,930
I remember.

287
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,283
But if you did...

288
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,366
I could see why.

289
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,882
I mean, Oliver Queen...

290
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,322
he is a billionaire by day...

291
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,562
and saves the city by night.

292
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,289
Sounds like you wanna date him.

293
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,730
I just have a little experience...

294
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,891
with liking someone
who doesn't see you the same way.

295
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,281
Protests continue into the final countdown
for tonight's ignition...

296
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,245
of S.T.A.R. Labs' controversial
particle accelerator.

297
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,408
S.T.A.R. Labs' founder, Harrison Wells...

298
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,003
promises a new era
of scientific advancement is at hand.

299
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,680
Guess I won't be back in time
to see them turn it on.

300
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,365
Look, I know it sounds crazy.

301
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,641
Human weapons?

302
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,660
Look, his name is Cyrus Gold.
He's the one

303
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,630
that broke into Queen
Consolidated last week.

304
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,088
He's the one that robbed the blood bank,
and he killed all those people.

305
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,964
Wait, hold on a second.

306
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,767
Where are you getting all this intel?

307
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,610
Aw, man, what's the matter with you?

308
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,929
Talking to the vigilante
is what got you demoted in the first place.

309
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,491
Look, we take a small squad.

310
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,126
McCarthy and Evans from SWAT, Jones.

311
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,606
We could bring this guy down.

312
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
I promised Jeannie I'd
take her christmas shopping.

313
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,083
Lucas, please.

314
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,565
Fine, but you get to call Jeannie
and tell her I'm not taking her shopping.

315
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,881
Hey, sir.

316
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,607
I don't mean to overstep,
but could you guys use an extra man?

317
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,162
Grab a vest, Officer Daily.

318
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,010
The police
are onto Gold. They're looking for him.

319
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,486
I made sure I'm in the loop.

320
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,490
We are too close to let
the police interfere.

321
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,283
Brother Cyrus...

322
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,006
the police are eager to meet you.

323
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,368
Introduce yourself.

324
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,169
So any plans for Christmas?

325
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,771
Lighting my menorah.

326
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,604
Hey.

327
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,650
Hey. How are you feeling?

328
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,211
Fine, just...

329
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,764
It's a little bit crowded
at my house and I wanted

330
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,827
to come down here and
get a little privacy.

331
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,005
Yeah.

332
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,522
Come on, Barry. We can watch
the countdown at Big Belly Burger.

333
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,520
- Your blood analysis is almost done.
- Thank you.

334
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,928
What's the matter, kid?

335
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,248
You look like you've seen a ghost.

336
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,444
- Are you sure he's in there?
- Yes Sir.

337
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,251
Sector car spotted Cyrus Gold entering.
He hasn't left.

338
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,442
Safety's off.

339
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,604
Open and surround him.

340
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,284
This is a nice place.

341
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,404
It's a bit more comfortable
than the fuselage on the island.

342
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,564
- You're not real.
- Neither are you.

343
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,771
You told everyone
when you started this crusade...

344
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,930
that it was about making up
for your father's sins.

345
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,561
That was a lie.

346
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,489
This charade is to atone for your sins.

347
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,369
- You're dead.
- You are not a hero.

348
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,050
Or a friend.

349
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,446
Or a brother.

350
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,642
You are nothing.

351
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,211
Do not turn your back on me. Not again.

352
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,968
You're gone.

353
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,484
Wherever I am, it's time you joined me.

354
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,084
They say a coward dies a thousand deaths.

355
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,683
- But even that wouldn't be enough for you.
- I tried to save you.

356
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,486
- And her.
- But you couldn't.

357
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,728
Just like you couldn't save this city.

358
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,084
The island didn't make you strong, kid.

359
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,370
It revealed you to be weak.

360
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,091
Thank you for being my shopping guide.
Are you okay?

361
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,921
Yeah, it's just, um...
Can I ask you a question?

362
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,721
- It's about the blood drive you sponsored.
- Of course. It's a wonderful cause.

363
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,521
Especially with the underfunded hospitals
we're dealing with. What about it?

364
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,887
Hello?

365
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,964
What?

366
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,765
Okay, I'll be right over.

367
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,689
- What happened?
- My father.

368
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,365
He's in the ICU. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

369
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,449
I'm sorry.

370
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,567
What happened in here?

371
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,683
- Did someone break in?
- No.

372
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,331
Uh, your blood analysis is done.

373
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,040
- Good news.
- So you know what's in my system?

374
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,123
That's the thing, your blood's clean.

375
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,607
- There's nothing wrong with you.
- Then why am I hallucinating?

376
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,071
I don't know. I mean,
whatever your problem is,

377
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,233
it's not pharmacological,
it's psychological.

378
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,801
- It's in your head.
- It's in my head.

379
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,603
Oh, my God.

380
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,211
Oliver.

381
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,007
- Dad.
- Honey.

382
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,208
Honey.

383
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,326
I can wiggle my toes.
That must be a good sign.

384
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,322
I'm all right, honey. I'm fine.

385
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,325
How's Lucas? Is he all right?

386
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,411
Uh...

387
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,962
I'm sorry.

388
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,327
What do you mean?

389
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,384
I gotta call Jeannie.
I gotta call his wife.

390
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:34,752
No, Dad, I'll do it.
You just stay here.

391
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,529
Get some rest.

392
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,206
What are you doing here?

393
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,364
I wanted to make sure
your father was okay.

394
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:58,389
He is.

395
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,124
Wanted to make sure you were too.

396
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,931
How are you, detective?

397
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,610
I'm alive.

398
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,128
Unlike most everyone else in my unit.

399
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,769
I'm sorry about your partner.

400
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,209
I took him in there.

401
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,402
Because of me.

402
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,971
I hate to disappoint you,
but not every death in this city is on you.

403
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,491
I got this off Gold.

404
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,367
Hopefully you can do something with it.

405
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,848
I didn't believe it at first, but this guy,
I mean, it's like he's not human.

406
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,491
He's human.

407
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,768
Well, then you can kill him.

408
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,167
For Hilton and me.

409
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,361
Think those are sharp enough.

410
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,602
Apparently I'm not.

411
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,962
Diggle, do you think I'm losing my mind?

412
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,522
No more than the rest of us.

413
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,609
I saw...

414
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,368
Slade Wilson.

415
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,606
Slade was my friend on the island...

416
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,126
and like Shado,
he is dead because of me.

417
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,607
Mr. Lance just told me that not every death
in this city is my fault. Fine.

418
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,282
But there are plenty that are.

419
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,123
When I got home from Afghanistan,
I saw a ghost too.

420
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,164
Survivor's guilt. Why us and not them?

421
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,885
See, I know why.

422
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,481
Then the why is not your problem.

423
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,408
How'd you make your ghost go away?

424
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,733
I figured out what they
were trying to tell me.

425
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:08,508
Which was?

426
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,407
That's for me to hear, Oliver.

427
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:13,750
You have to figure out what
yours are trying to tell you.

428
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,888
Guys, we got something here.

429
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,527
I scanned the key Lance gave you and
traced its serial code to the manufacturer.

430
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,520
This particular key fits a locked gate
somewhere on Crescent Circle in the Glades.

431
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,530
Where are you going?
You can't go out there in your condition.

432
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,040
I have to stop this.

433
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,961
Oliver, Gold left you
half dead, which is 50

434
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,894
percent better than how
he left Detective Hilton.

435
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,525
Felicity...

436
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,526
I don't have a choice.

437
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,926
I'll come back.

438
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,927
Promise me?

439
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,486
Stanton. Stanton.

440
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,564
Max.

441
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,370
It's ready.

442
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,886
Is this where you killed Max Stanton? Hmm?

443
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,686
What are you doing?
Stick that in me, I'll kill you.

444
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,204
No, Brother Roy, you'll kill for me.

445
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,208
Brother Cyrus told me he killed you.

446
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,448
Guess he's not as strong as you hoped.

447
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,931
Where'd you get the Mirakuru?

448
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,685
Who gave you the formula?

449
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,484
It was a gift.

450
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,604
A gift I will use to save
this city from itself.

451
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,686
Another failure.

452
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,247
Get up, Oliver.

453
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,687
Tommy?

454
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,803
You're not gonna die down here.

455
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,564
Tommy, I'm sorry.

456
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,367
I let you die.

457
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,245
You didn't let me die, Ollie.

458
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,002
You fought to save me.

459
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,124
Because that's what you do,
what you have always done.

460
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,368
You fight to survive.

461
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,047
I know I called you a murderer,
but you are not. You are a hero.

462
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,727
You beat the island.

463
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,809
You beat my father.

464
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,401
So fight, Oliver.

465
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,729
Get up and fight back.

466
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,044
Kill him.

467
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,006
Come on, Roy.

468
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,083
Right here.
I am not leaving anyone else to die.

469
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,489
You're a strong kid. Hey, come on, come on.

470
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,091
Come on, Roy.

471
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,090
Fight. Come on, fight!

472
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,964
Roy?

473
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,649
Roy.

474
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,651
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

475
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,201
I was...

476
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,368
I was running down another lead.

477
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,926
It didn't pan out.

478
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,130
I thought you were chasing after
the vigilante again.

479
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,400
I got so scared. I thought
something happened to you.

480
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,607
Hey, hey, don't worry.

481
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,851
I'm alive.

482
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,244
I wanna serve the people of Starling, not
the men and women who think they own it.

483
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,167
Together we can help rebuild our city...

484
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,887
into a place where there are no elites
and no oppressed.

485
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,641
Where we are all brothers and sisters.

486
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,644
So your campaign begins.

487
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,448
The city needs a leader.

488
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,368
And putting the copycat Hoods up to assassinating
the mayor was just the first step.

489
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,283
The vigilante...

490
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,805
he destroyed the centrifuge
and the serum along with it.

491
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,243
I will arrange for you
to receive another sample of my blood.

492
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,011
And then you can begin
to mass-produce the serum again.

493
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,040
When I ask you not to confront
the vigilante, you will listen.

494
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,802
Remember,
your mask can be worn by another.

495
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,727
You know who he is under that hood,
don't you?

496
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,529
I know exactly who he is.

497
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,400
He's my friend.

498
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,841
That's why you don't want him dead.

499
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,247
Death would be a release from this life,
and his sentence is yet to be carried out.

500
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,008
I am going to tear everything
he cares about away from him.

501
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,924
Destroy those who choose to follow him.

502
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,164
Corrupt those he loves.

503
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,811
Once he has lost everyone
and everything he values...

504
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,446
I will drive an arrow through his eye.

505
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,442
Shado.

506
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,044
Shado!

507
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,605
No.

508
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,361
Why?

509
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,206
- Ivo just shot her.

510
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,209
He didn't say why.

511
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,328
Whoever did this to her is going to suffer.

512
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,602
Still have a ghost problem?

513
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,242
No, I got the message.

514
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,563
But we...

515
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,849
we have other problems.

516
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,849
Wouldn't be us if we didn't.

517
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,408
- Roy was injected with the serum.
- Oh, my God. Is he okay?

518
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,090
He's alive, but we are gonna have
to keep an eye on him.

519
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,406
And Cyrus Gold?

520
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,649
Died on Saturday, buried on Sunday.

521
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,365
But he was working with someone.

522
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,600
I saw him.
He work a mask in the image of a skull.

523
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,451
He's trying to mass-produce the serum
to build an army.

524
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,921
For what?

525
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,528
You're a soldier.

526
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,690
- What's the primary purpose of an army?
- War.

527
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,967
- Where's Barry?
- He went back to Central City.

528
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,440
Wanted to get home in time to see them
turn on the particle accelerator.

529
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,283
I should take this.

530
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,160
- Hi.
- Hey.

531
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,222
Did you make it?

532
00:39:08,247 --> 00:39:10,712
Yeah, I made it back to
Central City in time...

533
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,248
but I missed the cutoff in line
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

534
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,649
I was late as usual. Ahem.

535
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,923
But in the spirit of not
being late again...

536
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,490
uh, if you ever decide
that Oliver Queen isn't the guy for you...

537
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,529
if you decide that you wanna go
on a date with someone else, urn...

538
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,203
you should know that, that guy,
he'll be on time.

539
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,765
Good to know.

540
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,646
Oh, hey, and I left something for Oliver.
I hope he likes it.

541
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,571
- Bye, Barry.
- Bye, Felicity.

542
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,041
I'm Linda Park.
We're live outside S.T.A.R. Labs...

543
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,965
despite the inclement weather,
which is only going to get worse.

544
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,283
The torrential downpour has driven away
almost all the protesters...

545
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,131
but S.T.A.R. Labs CEO Harrison Wells
has assured us...

546
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,642
that the storms will in no way
effect the particle accelerator...

547
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,167
which is up and running smoothly.

548
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,568
We are now being told to
evacuate the facility.

549
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,969
The storm may have caused a malfunction
to the primary cooling system.

550
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,130
Officials are now trying to shut down
the particle accelerator...

551
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,204
but so far have been unable
to regain control of the system.

552
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,644
Even the Arrow
deserves a Christmas present.

553
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,445
Here.

554
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,043
How do I look?

555
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,686
Like a hero.
