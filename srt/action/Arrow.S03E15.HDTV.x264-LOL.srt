you end up evading it.

- Just stop!

Why did you not
tell me?

00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:04,112
I had a right to know that justice
has not been done!

17
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:06,548
Because Oliver Queen
did not murder Taer Al-Sahfer.

Do you not believe his own confession
because you doubt his motives

19
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:13,989
or because you don't
approve of my grief?

20
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,992
- Sara was your beloved.
- And you've never approved.

21
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,428
I knew Sara would leave us.

I knew would end only in heartbreak.

right to be, but

165

it's been over a week, and
now that you know the truth,

No. It's about Sara.

Ok.

Malcolm drugged me.

He gave me something
that made me...

susceptible to suggestion,
and I--

talking about?

I didn't know what
I was doing, ok?

I'm so sorry, Laurel.

183

If Merlyn
drugged you...

184
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,674
then it wasn't
your fault.

185

But how could you
work with him?

186

How could you
stand by his side?

187
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,883
Because of the threat
of the League.

We have to work
with him.

I don't have
a choice.

Yes, you do.

191

What happened wasn't
your fault, Thea,

192
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,763
because it wasn't
your decision.

If you want to make
this right,

what you do from
now on...that is.

I can't remember
Sara's smile.

196

It's weird,
isn't it?

197
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,280

Sara used to smile

eyes and I try and picture it,

all I see is the way
that I found her.

You know, sometimes,
the only thing that keeps me going

202

one day finding her killer.

to Lacroix and Merlyn?

Do you really need to
ask me that question?

212
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:57,825
I'm not so consumed
with vengeance

that I blame Thea
for Sara's death.

all the different types

I don't want to see you put yourself
through that again.

Then go with him.

You might have hung up
the uniform, Johnnie,

482
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:17,696
but you're still
a soldier.

483
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:19,731
Standing down while your
friend goes into battle

484

the A.R.G.U.S. jet?

If your father dies
because of

something that
you've done,

496
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,495
there's a piece of you
that will go missing

497
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:52,197
and you'll never be
able to get it back.

That I can live with

499
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:57,068
but not you dying
because of me.

500
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,403
I am not gonna die,

501
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:00,338
and the only reason that
you think you can live

502
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,940
with Malcolm's death
is because

503
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:03,475
you don't really know

504

You're a good

Both of our parents
are dead because of me.

And that guilt...

508
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:18,356
That's something that
I have to live with.

Ra's: In 1854,
I encountered an illusionist

519
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,769
in Vienna,

520
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,404
and he was dazzling,

521
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:08,640

522
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:11,876

523
00:26:11,878 --> 00:26:14,746
and then nearly half
a century later,

524
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:17,382
I stumbled
upon this man again.

525
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:19,851
He was withered,

526
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:22,621

You see, a magician

529
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:29,728

many things

530
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,131
except one.

531
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,599
Please.

532
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:37,669
I was your horseman.

533
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:39,738
Let me hunt for you
once more.

534
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,773

to you

535
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:44,042
my reborn loyalty.

00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:48,280
Al Sa-Her, face
your death with honor.

Or at least dignity.

Please don't
do this.

In fact, I pretty

Well, that would make
you the only one.

Every soldier

that Andy would be

we aren't two dead men
