and we'll keep on digging...

599
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,000
and digging and digging.

600
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,080
And between 4:00 and 4:30 in the morning,
we're going to reach the end

601
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,910
of the 11 meters and 68 centimeters
of our tunnel,

602
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,700
which means that we're finally...

603
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,000
getting to the parking garage.

604
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,660
- Questions?
- How do we enter parking

605
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,160
without being seen?

606
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,330
Good! Good!

607
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,330
A good question. A very good question.

608
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,790
In two stages. First: Pakistan.

609
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,830
- Pakistan.
- That's right. And you'll give the order.

610
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,120
The mole's out for a walk.

611
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,870
Shakir.

612
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,500
- Shakir, now.
- Perfect, Professor.

613
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,750
The guys from Pakistan
will switch the video signal

614
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,410
of the internal security's computers,

615
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,910
and from then on, the guards
will only be watching a recording.

616
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,370
Stage two:

617
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Marseille.

618
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,620
Marseille will be at the very peak
of his partying

619
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,580
when all the bars in Madrid have closed,
but...

620
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,000
he'll certainly want to keep dancing
with his new girl,

621
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Sheila.

622
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Marseille.

623
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,750
On the line.

624
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,250
- Benjamín?
- I'm listening.

625
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,700
That will provide us
with the acoustic cover we need

626
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,250
so they don't hear the grinders.

627
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,870
Stopwatches.

628
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,250
Three... two... one.

629
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160

Time to go.

00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,750
If we can't kidnap Lisbon when
she gets there, what should we do?

760
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,590
Wait in the wall
until she's done testifying?

761
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,660
This time Lisbon won't take more
than 20 minutes

762
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,450
to get back to the parking garage.

765
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,660
Mrs. Murillo,
you incriminated yourself yesterday.

766
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,790
I advise you to still cooperate.

767
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,700
There could be benefits for you doing so.

768
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,580
So the judge will be forced to give
an early sentence and send her to prison,

769
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,410
and the same men who brought her in

770
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,620
will return to the parking garage
with her.

771
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,450
But this time, no one will be watching

772
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,080
<i>because the security guards</i>

773
