1
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:27,165
Master Nobu.

2
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,169
The necessary preparations have been made.

3
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:33,881
It's ready for use,
should it come to that.

4
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:37,843
And as per your orders,
we just obtained these.

5
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:42,014
Twenty targets in total,
all in New York City.

6
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:45,267
After years of searching...

7
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,854
the fate of Black Sky is in our hands.

8
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:54,777
Now this Daredevil is the only thing
that stands in our way.

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,613
- I suggest you get to work.
- Which one would you like to hit?

10
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:04,369
All of them.

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,581
We need to lay low.

12
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,542
They're gonna come for us.

13
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:14,922
Bullshit. They'll come for her.
What is this?

14
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:18,216
I'm sorry, old man, but I just can't
take chances with you anymore.

15
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:20,719
You're naïve.

16
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:23,513
She should be tied in this chair,
not me.

17
00:01:23,596 --> 00:01:26,308
She is not the problem.
They are.

18
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:30,395
They're gonna turn this city upside down
looking for her, Matty.

19
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,564
They'll watch it burn.

20
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,482
That's why I said
we need to work together.

21
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,860
There is no together.

22
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:39,446
All these years, I tried to tame her.

23
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:42,866
I should have let her bleed out
in the back of that car.

24
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,118
You should have some damn gratitude.
She spared your life.

25
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:50,248
The Black Sky cannot be controlled,
manipulated or transported.

26
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:53,251
It must be extinguished at all costs.

27
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:54,920
You wanna talk about being naïve?

28
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,756
'Cause right now you're tied to a chair...

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,175
spouting rhetoric about an ancient war.

30
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:03,679
Do you even have a plan?

31
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:07,599
I'm working on it.

32
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:09,977
Well, while you're working on it, son,

33
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,480
do me a favor
and pull your head out of your ass.

34
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:16,399
- The Black Sky...
- The Black Sky is bullshit, Stick.

35
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,110
It's a myth.
No one believes it but you.

36
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:21,321
Every assassin in the Hand believes it.

37
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:23,124
What do you think
they're gonna do about it?

38
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:25,325
What about what I believe, Stick?

39
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:29,037
What about what I'm gonna do about it?

40
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,444
Leave me alone, Matthew.

41
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:05,866
Stick's downstairs.

42
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:08,786
He's restrained.

43
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,127
You know, whatever you're feeling,
it's gonna pass.

44
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,462
What do you know
about what I'm feeling?

45
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:21,548
Just...

46
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:26,303
consider the possibility that
there is no such thing as a Black Sky.

47
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:32,100
That it's... it's mysticism, you know?
It's nonsense.

48
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,937
I've been trained to kill it
since I was a kid.

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,189
Yeah, maybe everything
they taught you was a lie.

50
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,691
Stick says I have a gift.

51
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:43,403
The special kind,
the kind very few people have...

52
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:45,486
"The kind very few people
have or deserve." I know.

53
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,115
I got the same speech.

54
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,451
Stick likes
his fortune-cookie wisdom, but...

55
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:53,621
that's all he needed, 'cause he was
training children to fight a war.

56
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,624
You can't deny it.

57
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,211
Some of what the Hand does
defies explanation.

58
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:00,712
Just because
I don't understand something

59
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:03,298
doesn't mean I'm ready
to chalk it up as some fairy tale.

60
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:07,010
True or not...

61
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:09,930
the legend says
that once they have the Black Sky

62
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:11,264
they'll be capable of anything.

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,726
It's not about what I'm willing to do.

64
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,562
Even in a cage I'll be their false idol.

65
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:19,439
They'll do terrible things in my name

66
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,150
because they think the Black Sky
will make them invincible.

67
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:25,904
Well, they can't have you.
You don't belong to anyone.

68
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,405
And you may be smarter and stronger

69
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:30,700
and more powerful
than anyone they've ever met...

70
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:35,372
but like I keep saying,
they don't get to tell you who you are.

71
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,541
Their organization
is older than most countries.

72
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:43,171
They're powerful...
and they're everywhere.

73
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:45,590
And they survived just like the Chaste...

74
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:47,509
by staying in the shadows...

75
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:51,304
by getting people to believe
wholeheartedly in their legend.

76
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:54,266
But if we shine a light on them,
they'll scatter... all right?

77
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:57,519
We can take them down.
Not Stick's way. We can do it our way.

78
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:01,857
You would trust me...

79
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,527
after all I've put you through?

80
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:12,659
The Hand's ninjas
can mask their heartbeats...

81
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:17,247
Yours is always loud and clear.

82
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,168
I've been fighting this war my whole life.

83
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,629
I've heard every story.

84
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:28,716
Some people say
Nobu's lived three lifetimes.

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,137
A criminal record that goes back decades.

86
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,183
True or not, he's the head of the snake.

87
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:40,020
But he's our best chance
of taking down the Hand.

88
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:42,480
Then our job is simple.
We find Nobu. We extract him.

89
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:45,650
We remove him from the Hand
without alerting his troops.

90
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:50,238
Can't be that easy.

91
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,116
Giving up is easy.

92
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:58,997
You will kill him?

93
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:00,207
No.

94
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,002
That would make him a martyr.

95
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,504
I wanna dethrone him.

96
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,674
Defrock him and let him rot in a cell.

97
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:14,262
Show this cult of his
that their holy man...

98
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,139
isn't anything but a guy.

99
00:06:19,351 --> 00:06:21,103
- We'll have to find him first.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:24,022
And I say we head
straight into the lion's den.

101
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,360
The last thing they're expecting
is that we hit back at them now.

102
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:33,781
You would risk everything for me?

103
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,458
So how do we do this?

104
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:47,629
Not alone.

105
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,219
We do it together.

106
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,165
Our firm represents
Hell's Kitchen's top clients.

107
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,958
Of course, by accepting our offer

108
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:10,128
you'll get a personal assistant,
a corner office,

109
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:13,965
and the opportunity to branch out
and build your own client base.

110
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:18,303
Your former associate, Ms. Marci Stahl,
recommends you very highly.

111
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:21,931
And after reviewing
the infamous Punisher trial,

112
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:26,561
I would be foolish not to invite
a talent like yourself onto our team.

113
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:30,648
Hopefully, you'll find
our starting salary competitive.

114
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:36,904
That's...

115
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,407
one way to describe it.

116
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:40,575
It gets better.

117
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:45,580
How does "Hogarth, Chao,
Benowitz and Nelson" sound?

118
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,207
Like a mouthful.

119
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,084
A good mouthful.

120
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,669
You think outside of the box,

121
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:55,340
and that is exactly
what we're looking for.

122
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:58,176
If the past few months are any indication,

123
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,764
my firm is going to need
a very resourceful attorney.

124
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,182
Someone like you...

125
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:09,354
who's not afraid to take on riskier,
non-traditional cases.

126
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:11,148
Cases involving vigilantes.

127
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:13,900
Let's call them
"people with complexities."

128
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,319
You have no idea.

129
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,739
Try me.

130
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:56,651
Yeah, I don't know about this.

131
00:09:56,734 --> 00:10:00,738
I made all this stuff to keep Betsy safe,
not just give it away.

132
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:03,991
- You'll get it back, Melvin.
- Without a scratch.

133
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:05,160
Promise.

134
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:08,913
If you say so.

135
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:18,381
Expecting trouble?

136
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:21,218
- Yeah, a little bit.
- That figures.

137
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,720
Well, it's a good thing you got company.

138
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:26,348
Ah, before I forget.

139
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,730
These are for you.

140
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,067
Merry Christmas, huh?

141
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:41,404
What is it?

142
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:43,155
Billy club.

143
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,908
Like the cops use, only, like,
a million times cooler.

144
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:48,995
It's my own design.
Special steel fiber composite cable.

145
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:50,788
Damn near indestructible.

146
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:52,457
Check it out.
You can change the length.

147
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,211
Here, play with it.

148
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,886
- Where's mine?
- That's, uh...

149
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:07,764
- It's a prototype. I only made one.
- Hey. Hey, don't mind her.

150
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,057
So, check it out.

151
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:13,102
You could use it as a grappling hook,
or, uh...

152
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:16,439
close quarter combat.

153
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,190
The possibilities are endless.
Here.

154
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,158
Melvin, I... I don't know what to say.

155
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,327
Don't say anything.

156
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,329
I mean,
the papers might not report it, but...

157
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:34,707
some of us in Hell's Kitchen,
we know who's really looking out for us.

158
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,917
It's yours, man.

159
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,728
How does it feel?

160
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:03,815
Knowing that the kids you've trained
are going to fight your war for you...

161
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,775
while you're sitting here?

162
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,652
Biggest mistake of your life, child.

163
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:08,903
Maybe.

164
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,699
But it'll be my mistake,
because this is my life.

165
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:16,994
All right, let's go.

166
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:18,663
We'll hit the tunnels
and we'll spread out from...

167
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:21,833
<i>Foggy. Foggy. Foggy.</i>

168
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,126
<i>Foggy.</i>

169
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,045
<i>Foggy.</i>

170
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:27,379
<i>- Will you take that?
- Foggy.</i>

171
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:29,966
<i>- Yeah, I'll just be a sec.
- Foggy.</i>

172
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,009
<i>- Foggy?
- Yeah.</i>

173
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,970
Sorry, man, it's not a good time.

174
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:37,014
- I was afraid you'd say that.
- Are you at the police station?

175
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:39,642
<i>Brett says he's in deep shit
and needs legal counsel,</i>

176
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,060
so he was just desperate
enough to call me.

177
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,895
I figured it was my problem
till I got down here,

178
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:45,022
took a look at his face.

179
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:47,484
Something went down.
He won't spill it,

180
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,401
<i>but he's been roughed up.
He says it was some gangbangers.</i>

181
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:51,112
<i>But I've known him long enough
to tell when he's lying.</i>

182
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,573
<i>- Why does he need a lawyer?
- They wanted files, Matt.</i>

183
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:55,241
Classified police stuff.

184
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,619
All right, this...
It's gonna have to wait. I can't...

185
00:14:57,702 --> 00:15:00,997
<i>Not just any files.
They were asking about you.</i>

186
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,332
And I'm not talking about Matt Murdock.

187
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,879
- Uh, what did they want?
- I have no idea.

188
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,047
But from the looks of him,
they wanted it pretty bad.

189
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:13,926
<i>He's helped us and Daredevil,
stuck his neck out when he didn't have to.</i>

190
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,553
<i>- And now...
- Yeah, okay. I'm on it.</i>

191
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,929
<i>- I'll be right down.
- Okay.</i>

192
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:19,599
You better be.

193
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:54,551
So...
this is what it's come to, huh?

194
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,679
The masked vigilante
is the only one I can trust.

195
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,597
What happened?

196
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:03,560
I knew it was just a matter of time
till you showed up... again.

197
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:07,188
It'd be better if you just told me,
Detective.

198
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:15,572
Not the first time
some asshole roughs me up.

199
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:19,158
The job...
This shit ain't easy.

200
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,828
But then they said
they got eyes on my mom.

201
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:25,748
Said they were gonna kill her.
Even put her on the phone.

202
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:27,249
Who?

203
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,420
No idea.
Worked for someone big, though.

204
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:35,758
Had real power behind those fists,
and I'm not talking muscles.

205
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:39,261
They wanted everything we had on you.

206
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,848
I don't imagine you have much.

207
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:46,352
Well, it might surprise you to know that
we do keep track of two things real well.

208
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:49,772
Records of people you put away...

209
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:52,191
and incident reports.

210
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:54,526
Records on everyone else.

211
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:55,820
Everyone else?

212
00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:59,991
That's what they were after.

213
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,744
They wanted to know
everyone you ever saved.

214
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:15,817
Karen.

215
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:07,076
Get your damn hands
off me, asshole!

216
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,876
Hey.

217
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:19,005
Any idea who these people are?

218
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,131
No.

219
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,134
Where'd they grab you?

220
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:25,052
- Who gives a shit?
- Just tell me.

221
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,140
42nd and 9th.

222
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:32,852
Wasn't doing nothing.
Taking a goddamn stroll.

223
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:35,897
Supposed to be on house arrest.

224
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:38,983
House arrest?

225
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:41,944
You're being monitored?

226
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,613
- What are you, my PO?
- Look, I'm trying to help here.

227
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,331
Thank God.

228
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,652
That means they know you're here.

229
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,754
Mmm, I might have tampered with it a bit.

230
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:01,964
- What?
- A boy's gotta get out once in a while,

231
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,048
- you know what I mean?
- Put it on. Turn it back on.

232
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,803
- And get shot by these assholes?
- No more talking.

233
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,347
Do you want to stay alive or what?

234
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:20,107
- What's your name?
- Karen Page.

235
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,608
What's yours?

236
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,156
You leave her alone!

237
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:33,788
I was a POW in Laos.
This is a cakewalk.

238
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,582
You and me!

239
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:39,251
One on one.
Huh? Coward!

240
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,879
- Coward!
- Hey! Look, look, look, look, look!

241
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:44,203
He doesn't know what he's saying,
all right? He's scared.

242
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:51,097
Not anymore.

243
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:55,517
The next one to make a sound dies.

244
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:00,857
Hey.

245
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,463
Come on.

246
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:30,344
Come on, come on.

247
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:34,932
Come on.

248
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:38,644
Come on.

249
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:41,688
Come on.

250
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:44,566
The people they took aren't the target.

251
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,279
They're bait.
The Hand's trying to lure me in.

252
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:49,906
It's me they want.

253
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:54,618
- You're the only thing in their way.
- Those people are innocent.

254
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:56,787
You can't just take the bait.

255
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:58,873
I know, but I can't
just abandon them either.

256
00:21:58,956 --> 00:21:59,957
I know.

257
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,210
We gotta get ahead of this thing
before any of them get hurt.

258
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:09,841
Slow your breath.

259
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:13,720
Focus.

260
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:16,015
Okay. Focus.

261
00:22:21,228 --> 00:22:22,939
You'll find them.

262
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:25,816
You'll find her, Matthew.

263
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,281
I can't hear... hear anything!

264
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,616
The electricity in this building
is too loud.

265
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,411
- The city is pulsing like...
- Matthew, it's... it's your city.

266
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:38,829
Calm it down.

267
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:40,998
- Okay?
- Okay.

268
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:42,959
Tune out everything that's not essential.

269
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:56,263
Now...

270
00:22:58,057 --> 00:22:59,891
...one at a time.

271
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:23,082
Okay, go!

272
00:24:09,253 --> 00:24:11,004
Shit.

273
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,966
Take care of it.
I'll tell him.

274
00:24:28,564 --> 00:24:31,692
What part of house arrest
do these assholes not understand?

275
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:37,864
10-13, officer down.
36th and 7th.

276
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:39,388
They stuck him with a goddamn arrow!

277
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:46,123
<i>Copy that. 10-13.
Officer down. Backup on the way. Over.</i>

278
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:19,615
This is it.
There's police below.

279
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,075
Two officers already dead.

280
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,370
Fifteen, twenty hostages inside.

281
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:27,289
Nobu's men?

282
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:29,375
Yeah, they can hide their hearts, but...

283
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:32,503
when there's this many of them,
they're buzzing like a beehive.

284
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:34,380
- How many?
- I don't know.

285
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:36,632
Could be an army.

286
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:39,176
- Can you isolate Nobu?
- No.

287
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:42,513
We can't move until we're sure he's here.

288
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:44,306
We have to do something
before these people get hurt.

289
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,849
I'm not here for them.

290
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:48,310
I came to take down Nobu
and you said you'd help.

291
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:50,479
I know, and I will, Elektra,
but right now, the people in that...

292
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:52,356
They were used to draw us out.

293
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:56,693
I'm sorry, Matthew,
but saving them wouldn't help us.

294
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,779
There are 20 innocent people in there.

295
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:01,990
If we go in there right now,
Nobu gets what he wants.

296
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:05,577
You dead, me captured.
The Hand wins.

297
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:08,330
I know it's harsh,

298
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:10,707
but the people in there
are a drop in the ocean

299
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,169
compared to what happens next
if Nobu gets hold of me.

300
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:15,754
These people are in danger because of me.

301
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:19,425
And I'll be damned
if I'm not getting them out.

302
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:22,803
- It's the wrong play.
- It's the only play.

303
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,222
You stay here.
I got work to do.

304
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:31,102
It's gonna be fine.

305
00:26:31,187 --> 00:26:32,563
- Shit.
- No.

306
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:33,730
Please, oh, no, please.
It's nothing!

307
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:35,614
There's nothing there.
You don't have to look.

308
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:39,445
It's a family heirloom. It's nothing.

309
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:42,739
- It's okay. It's fine.
- No. Listen, calm down.

310
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:44,450
It's nothing.

311
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:45,909
It's nothing.

312
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,119
There's a button, we can...

313
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:50,789
Hold on.

314
00:26:50,872 --> 00:26:52,708
No. No! Get off me!

315
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,376
- It wasn't my idea!
- You don't have to do that! Please!

316
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,002
He'll turn it off!
Oh, my God!

317
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:18,942
Out the door, take a right!

318
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,236
Go!

319
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:23,280
Go, go, go, go! Hurry!

320
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:25,824
Here.

321
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:32,623
You're okay?

322
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,293
Better now.
Oh, God.

323
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,048
- Go, go, go.
- No, no, no... wait, wait, wait.

324
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:54,936
Keep going out the door.

325
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,813
Wait, you okay?

326
00:27:56,897 --> 00:27:57,981
- Can you help her?
- Yeah.

327
00:27:58,064 --> 00:27:59,691
Okay. Come on.

328
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,501
I got bored.

329
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:42,359
The only way out is up.
Let's head to the roof.

330
00:29:05,256 --> 00:29:09,219
The Black Sky will be ours.

331
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:26,987
Hold your fire!

332
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,030
Hold your fire.

333
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:34,077
Sarge, they have snipers
on all the entrances. We can't go in.

334
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,871
Okay, well, hold your fire.

335
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,590
Somebody's coming out.

336
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:48,008
I said hold your fire.

337
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:52,303
Oh, shit.

338
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,516
Get EMS on scene now!

339
00:29:57,434 --> 00:29:59,478
These people are in shock.
Get 'em out of here and get 'em help.

340
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,522
- Move!
- Brett?

341
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:03,399
- Page?
- Yeah.

342
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:11,407
Any shitstorm you're not a part of?
What's going on up there?

343
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,116
These people are being used for bait.

344
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:16,119
There's some kind of weird cult up there,
and they want Daredevil.

345
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:21,375
We need those big lights!

346
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:25,754
Light it up!
Hit 'em up there, there, and there!

347
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,881
If something happens on that roof,
I wanna see it.

348
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:29,299
Karen!

349
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,760
Foggy?
What are you doing here?

350
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:34,220
Jesus. Brett said there was
shit going down, but he didn't say this.

351
00:30:34,304 --> 00:30:35,722
- Yeah.
- I'm just glad you're okay.

352
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:38,850
Thanks.
But I'm not the only one in danger.

353
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:39,976
What's going on up there?

354
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,772
I think it might be the end
of vigilantes in New York.

355
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:45,399
Holy shit.

356
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:59,037
I'm not gonna lie to you.

357
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,997
There's a lot more coming.

358
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,461
One thing's for sure.

359
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:07,170
We're gonna die.

360
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,978
Do you wanna end it here...
or on the roof?

361
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:28,274
I've always liked the fresh air.

362
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,424
What's up there?

363
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:55,426
Oh, Jesus.

364
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,140
Too many to count.

365
00:32:00,223 --> 00:32:02,726
Armed, packing katanas,
couple of longbows.

366
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,814
More coming up from below.
Same weapons.

367
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:13,444
I'd say we've got a couple of minutes
before they break through that door.

368
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:16,197
Okay.

369
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:24,414
Even if we survive...

370
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:27,042
we may not see each other again.

371
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,422
Okay, let's do it.

372
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:35,258
Wait, wait. Wait for one second.
One second.

373
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:38,011
So, what if...

374
00:32:42,724 --> 00:32:44,267
What if...

375
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:48,104
from now on, if... if we make it...

376
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:51,942
wherever you run, I...

377
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,402
I run with you?

378
00:32:57,072 --> 00:32:58,489
You're not serious.

379
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,325
I've never been more serious.

380
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:07,040
This...
Elektra, this is a part of me that I need.

381
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,544
And you're the only one who gets it.

382
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:13,839
Without this, I'm not alive.
I'm not. Not really.

383
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:17,008
And I know that now, thanks to you.

384
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:21,096
I don't know what we are together,

385
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,724
and if we have any chance in the future...

386
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,851
I don't...

387
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:30,021
But I... I do know that I'm free with you.

388
00:33:31,272 --> 00:33:32,816
Like with no one else.

389
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:36,319
You hide from yourself.

390
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:40,699
You don't let anyone in.

391
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:41,867
You.

392
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:45,579
I let you in.

393
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:49,583
Think about it.

394
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:52,669
What if this isn't the end?

395
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:55,756
What if it's just the beginning?

396
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:58,008
No.

397
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:02,971
They'll find us.

398
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:04,555
No, we'll keep moving.

399
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:09,603
We'll change identities. We'll...
we'll hide. They'll never catch us.

400
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:12,063
What do you say?

401
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:17,027
Uh, I say...

402
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,445
let's go to London.

403
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:22,658
Yeah? Madrid.
Tunisia.

404
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,785
There are sexy places to hide.

405
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:28,830
Hey, I've never been further north
than 116th Street, so...

406
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:31,750
Because you love New York.

407
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,335
And I'd give my life for it, but...

408
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:39,299
there's one thing in this world
that makes me feel more alive.

409
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:41,426
And that's you.

410
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:46,640
I'm the Black Sky, Matthew.

411
00:34:46,723 --> 00:34:49,184
Yeah, and I'm the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

412
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:55,691
The airport's just a cab fare away.

413
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:59,778
All we gotta do is survive whatever's
waiting for us behind that door.

414
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:02,530
Let's get out of here.

415
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:22,508
Remember
they're trying to kill me, not you.

416
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:23,969
Over my dead body.

417
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:45,782
No one...

418
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:50,078
escapes destiny.

419
00:35:58,378 --> 00:36:00,546
You belong to us.

420
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,383
- And you...
- belong in the ground.

421
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:32,889
You're done, Nobu.

422
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:34,474
Your army will crumble.

423
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,060
And you will leave my city alone.

424
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:40,521
Your city belongs to no one.

425
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:42,523
And she...

426
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:44,442
belongs to us!

427
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:42,833
No.

428
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:49,632
No, Elektra.

429
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:56,806
They have nothing now.

430
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:00,060
I took it all away.

431
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:07,733
It's okay. It's okay.
Try not to talk.

432
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:13,781
I know... I know now...

433
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:17,702
what it feels...

434
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,081
to be good.

435
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:25,835
Just relax.

436
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:27,670
Try not to... try not to talk.

437
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:34,469
Does it always hurt that much?

438
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:42,393
Yeah.

439
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:46,689
Yeah, it, uh...
it always hurts that much.

440
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:53,029
This is not the end.

441
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:44,205
Finish him.

442
00:40:57,677 --> 00:40:59,095
Get down. Get down.

443
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:00,555
Don't move!
Everybody get down!

444
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,092
Frank.

445
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:50,813
See you around, Red.

446
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:09,099
And this time, you piece of shit...

447
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:17,525
...stay down.

448
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:56,314
I wanted to say a few words, but...

449
00:43:58,691 --> 00:43:59,984
I don't have any.

450
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:04,530
God rest her soul.

451
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:07,867
That should be enough.

452
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:13,623
You know, once in college,
I brought her roses.

453
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,627
She hates roses.

454
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,343
You wanted her dead.

455
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,560
Was it worth it?

456
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:38,731
What?

457
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,609
Loving her.

458
00:44:48,198 --> 00:44:50,826
You taught me
to cut all my ties to humanity...

459
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:53,538
to other people.

460
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:58,083
I had only a few moments with her...

461
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,382
amidst all the...
noise, chaos, and the violence.

462
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:10,930
We were together only for moments.
That was all.

463
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,813
Orchids.

464
00:45:20,147 --> 00:45:21,399
She likes orchids.

465
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:27,154
And, yeah, Stick... it was worth it.

466
00:45:31,283 --> 00:45:36,246
Matt, you are the toughest
son of a bitch I have ever met.

467
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,667
Let's go home.

468
00:46:40,102 --> 00:46:41,562
Are you gonna be okay?

469
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:46,233
I came to New York thinking there's no way
I could feel lonely in a city of millions.

470
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:49,445
But you do.

471
00:46:49,529 --> 00:46:51,781
Somehow it makes it all worse.

472
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:56,452
I used to love coming here...

473
00:46:56,536 --> 00:46:58,370
with you and Matt.

474
00:46:59,914 --> 00:47:01,707
Josie's actually felt like home.

475
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:06,879
A home with... very sticky floors
and belligerent drunks, nightly.

476
00:47:06,962 --> 00:47:08,380
Right.

477
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:11,216
And now, no Matt.

478
00:47:13,177 --> 00:47:14,637
No us.

479
00:47:15,555 --> 00:47:17,557
No Nelson, Murdock, Page.

480
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:24,522
We may not be
working together anymore...

481
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,982
but you're not alone, Karen.

482
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,068
I'm still your friend...

483
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:31,153
if you'll let me be.

484
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:36,158
Yeah, you're not getting out
that easy, Nelson.

485
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:37,785
You are stuck with me.

486
00:47:37,868 --> 00:47:40,037
Wouldn't have it any other way.

487
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,415
You're gonna be all right.

488
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,001
More than all right.

489
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:48,337
- You're gonna come out on top.
- Thanks.

490
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,964
How about you?

491
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:53,425
Big job, hotshot,
corner office lawyer man.

492
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:55,845
It could be exciting.

493
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:58,013
- Yeah, you could be rich.
- Yeah, rich enough to stop drinking

494
00:47:58,097 --> 00:48:00,475
the rotgut swill they serve here.

495
00:48:04,186 --> 00:48:05,229
Hey, Josie.

496
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:09,316
About that long-running
Nelson-Murdock tab...

497
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:11,026
- Yeah, yeah, I'll add it on.
- No.

498
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,196
We're, uh... we're gonna settle up.

499
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:17,658
Close us out, Josie.
We're done here.

500
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:46,353
Karen Page, what the hell
are you still doing here?

501
00:48:46,436 --> 00:48:47,813
It's Christmas Eve.

502
00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:51,901
Shouldn't you be home celebrating
with all that family that you...

503
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:54,028
can't stand, like everybody else?

504
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:55,946
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I must be projecting.

505
00:48:57,114 --> 00:48:58,323
I, uh...

506
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:01,536
can't seem to stop
staring at a blank screen.

507
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,203
- Writer's block.
- Mmm.

508
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:04,705
There's a cure.

509
00:49:06,248 --> 00:49:08,500
- Scotch.
- That helps you write?

510
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:10,252
Wow! No.

511
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,464
No, it just...
helps me not care so much.

512
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:17,092
Yeah, well,
that's definitely my problem.

513
00:49:18,343 --> 00:49:21,597
I care, probably too much,
about all of it.

514
00:49:22,557 --> 00:49:25,685
I don't even know
if I should start with...

515
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:28,854
the hostage crisis, or Frank,
or vigilante justice...

516
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:30,773
That's just... that's just garbage.

517
00:49:32,524 --> 00:49:34,652
- Well, it's news.
- No, it's not.

518
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:38,155
Not anymore. I mean, all the facts
about that have been reported already.

519
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:40,449
Look.

520
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:45,537
If you... if you really wanna
torture yourself this holiday,

521
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:47,122
go ahead, be my guest.

522
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:50,334
But at least write something new.

523
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:52,294
Something different.

524
00:49:52,377 --> 00:49:55,255
- Something that only you can write.
- Right. Which...

525
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:57,675
which would be what?

526
00:49:57,758 --> 00:49:59,009
The truth.

527
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:02,221
Your truth, Karen.

528
00:50:03,263 --> 00:50:06,266
All of it.
Everything that you've been through.

529
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,310
Don't pull any punches.

530
00:50:08,393 --> 00:50:12,982
This is New York.
People think that they've seen everything.

531
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:18,863
Prove 'em wrong.
Tell them something they don't know.

532
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:23,533
Hell,
I'd read the shit out of that.

533
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:35,379
Happy Hanukkah.

534
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:40,801
- Scotch.
- Mmm, you know, just... just in case.

535
00:50:42,302 --> 00:50:46,140
I'll expect 2,000 words in my inbox
before Santa shows up.

536
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,184
You got it, boss.

537
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:06,243
Okay.

538
00:51:23,593 --> 00:51:26,180
<i>"What is it, to be a hero?</i>

539

544
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:02,674
<i>a survivor of Hell's Kitchen...</i>

545
00:52:03,675 --> 00:52:05,970
<i>the hottest place anyone's ever known.</i>

546
00:52:07,096 --> 00:52:08,931
<i>A place where cowards don't last long.</i>

547
00:52:09,014 --> 00:52:11,475

548

<i>We all are.</i>

<i>Some more than others,
but none of us alone.</i>

550
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:23,528
<i>Some bloody their fists

young or old, you live here.</i>

556

<i>You didn't choose this town.
It chose you.</i>

557
00:52:56,478 --> 00:53:00,607

who lives above us, keeping us safe.</i>

558

Thanks for meeting me.

568
00:54:23,815 --> 00:54:25,567
What am I doing here, Matt?

569
00:54:27,236 --> 00:54:30,197
I, uh...
I have something.

570
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,867
- No, I don't want it.
- I have something...

571
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:37,121
that I need you to see.

572
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:01,311
I'm Daredevil.
