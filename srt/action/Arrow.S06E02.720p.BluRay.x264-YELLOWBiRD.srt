1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,747
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,630
<i>After five years in hell,
I returned home with only one goal,</i>

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,332
<i>to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,509
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,965
<i>By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,843
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,510
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,895
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,473
Promise me that you'll be his father.

11
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,728
I promise.

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,064
William blames me
for Samantha's death.

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,609
Now, you don't have to like me.
I'm your dad.

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,901
I'm gonna be there for you,
whether you want me to be or not.

15
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,829
<i>Curtis and Lance took Rene
to Dr. Schwartz for treatment.</i>

16
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,003
Saw you take the shot at that merc,
never seen you miss.

17
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,500
Turn on Channel 52, right now.

18
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,291
<i>This photo provides unequivocal proof</i>

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,129
<i>of the identity of the vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.</i>

20
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,303
What are we gonna do?

21
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,218
I don't know.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,472
Anything interesting
on the news last night?

23
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,307
Can you comment
on the photo released last night?

24
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,018
How do you feel about
the accusation of being the Green Arrow?

25
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,855
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

26
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,443
If you wanna know what I have to say

27
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,320
it would probably help
if you could hear me.

28
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,860
Thank you.

29
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,286
I'm gonna tell you two things,

30
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,988
both of which
you probably already know.

31
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:26,451
First, this is important,
I am not the Green Arrow.

32
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,502
If you're not the Green Arrow,
then who is?

33
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,796
Number two,

34
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,588
photos can be doctored.

35
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,793
They could've put Bruce Wayne's head
on that body.

36
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,970
Has Bruce Wayne left Gotham
to hangout in Star City recently?

37
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,092
No.

38
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,424
Now, if I was running around the city

39
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,805
during the day
and managing it as mayor,

40
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,309
while running around at night
fighting criminals as a vigilante,

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,436
that really would make me
a superhero.

42
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,320
But I'm not, I'm just the mayor.

43
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,864
Thank you very much.

44
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,240
You seem to be taking this
in your stride.

45
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,037
I've been here before with you.

46
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,367
Yeah, but I didn't have a photograph
of you in <i>flagrante de Arrow.</i>

47
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,789
- Where did Channel 52 get the photo?
- Anonymous source.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,122
Arrived in yesterday's mail.
No return address.

49
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,047
Get the envelope,
let's get it to forensics

50
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,841
and let's figure out who leaked it.

51
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,048
And why.

52
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,932
We can't let this distract us.
Where are we with rebuilding SCPD?

53
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,975
Well, I fast-tracked
the insurance claim.

54
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,678
So, we should have 20 million
burning a hole

55
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,183
in our account by the end of the day.

56
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,434
Our account?

57
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,607
I figure we peel off
a few bucks and fly off to Vegas.

58
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,729
That's cute.

59
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,272
I think it might be
a little suspicious

60
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,820
if Oliver left town right about now.

61
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,148
I need to be in town
for the Markovian delegation.

62
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,570
So, it's all right for me to go
to Vegas, is what you're saying?

63
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,874
<i>Hello?</i>

64
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,337
I don't think
you have an appointment.

65
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,506
No, but I really don't need one.

66
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,042
Special Agent Samanda Watson.

67
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,919
Uh, can we help you with something?

68
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,676
Not really. I'm here as a courtesy,

69
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,383
to inform you of the investigation
I'll be conducting in your city.

70
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,763
Investigation into what?

71
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,552
You.

72
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,180
You gotta be kidding.

73
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,765
Yeah, because the FBI is
world-renowned for its sense of humor.

74
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,436
You were on the news last night

75
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,066
wearing the outfit
of a known criminal.

76
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,324
Can you honestly say you're surprised
there's an investigation?

77
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,823
No, but I wasn't expecting the FBI.

78
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,780
Well, quite frankly,
the local law enforcement

79
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,411
has proven ineffective
where the Green Arrow is concerned.

80
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,292
Agent Watson?

81
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,626
- Yes.
- I was cleared five years ago.

82
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,504
Of being The Hood,
not the Green Arrow.

83
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,419
And you were cleared by the guy
who's now your deputy mayor.

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,593
Would like me to send you a copy of
the polygraph that Mr. Queen passed?

85
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,764
For starters.

86
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,851
The local AG will be issuing
subpoenas later on today.

87
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,975
It was nice meeting you, gentlemen.

88
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,433
I'm sure we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

89
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,161
At least they caught his good side.

90
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,906
Sorry, not funny.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,411
All right, John said
you guys have experience

92
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,117
putting this particular genie
back in the bottle.

93
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,998
Well, yeah, I mean,
John's put on the hood on before,

94
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,169
but I don't see how
that's gonna work now,

95
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,588
not with photographic evidence.

96
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,710
What about the human target?

97
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,916
The human what-now?

98
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,835
Best cosplayer ever.

99
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,669
He can literally make himself
look like someone else.

100
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,256
Yeah, Chance is out of the country
right now, only God knows where.

101
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,261
We have to think of a new way
of getting out of this.

102
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,554
And if we can't?

103
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,887
Because assuming Oliver
does not go to prison,

104
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,222
he's not gonna be able to do anything
with a million eyes on him.

105
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,228
Not to mention that if he's outed...

106
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,563
Rather if he stays outed,

107
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,569
it won't be much of a leap
to the rest of us.

108
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,110
- One step at a time.
- Okay.

109
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,658
First step being, figuring out
where this picture came from.

110
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,990
It came from nowhere.

111
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,571
What do you mean?

112
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,373
I mean, this envelope wasn't
mailed, delivered or sent.

113
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,702
It came from inside
the Channel 52 news offices.

114
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,870
- How do we know that?
- Barcode.

115
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,673
Channel 52 uses it
for internal traffic.

116
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,215
How many people work there?

117
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,919
Five-hundred and sixty-eight.

118
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,470
All right, I'm just gonna
say it to say it,

119
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,546
what if this was Chase?

120
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,974
He could've put this in motion
months ago, a little parting gift.

121
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,972
Seems like his style
messing with you like this.

122
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,145
It is more than possible.

123
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,390
How's your boy holding up
with all this?

124
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,898
Okay. I wanted to keep him home from
school, but he insisted on going.

125
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,479
- Like his father, huh?
- I wasn't much of a student.

126
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,905
I mean, he's tough.

127
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,283
Where's he standing?

128
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,496
If we can figure out when and where
this was taken,

129
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,792
it could give us something to go on.

130
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,244
I wrote an image analysis algorithm,

131
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,125
but there's just not very much
for the computer to chew on.

132
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,877
Was the original photo
taken digitally,

133
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,003
or was it taken
the old-fashioned way?

134
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,800
Digital. Printed on standard
inkjet stock.

135
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,673
- Hmm.
- Okay, maybe if we can get the file,

136
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,426
there may be metadata on it and
we can figure out who took the photo.

137
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,632
That's a pretty epic maybe.

138
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,263
Yeah, well, like you said,
if we don't figure this out and fast,

139
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,639
we're screwed.

140
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,721
- I did say that, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

141
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,977
This could destroy our whole lives.

142
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,184
It's hard to think that before,
my biggest worry was

143
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,189
getting a new job, and now...

144
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,813
It's about whether or not
we'll end up in jail.

145
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,899
I thought you were sitting pretty
from your Palmer Tech severance.

146
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,484
Yeah, from like a year ago.

147
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,453
What are you gonna do?
Assuming that we're all not in jail.

148
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,246
I mean, I'd definitely rather go to
Iron Heights

149
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,948
than work at Tech Village again.
That place was horrendous.

150
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,667
What about you? I mean, you've been
out of a job as long as I have.

151
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,754
Not really. I've been doing some
freelance coding in my spare time.

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,547
What? What spare time?

153
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,794
Yeah, tell me about it.

154
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,044
Barely any but I did not take a dime
from Paul in the divorce

155
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,253
and a man's gotta eat.

156
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,464
So you just got a secret job this whole
time you didn't tell anyone about?

157
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,299
I thought we all, like,
had, like, secret jobs.

158
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,804
- No.
- Except for John maybe.

159
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,931
What does he do for money?

160
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,262
That's something
that's been perplexing me.

161
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,517
Well, he's married
to the director of A.R.G.U.S.

162
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,099
Ah. Yeah, that's right.

163
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,399
She does make a lot of money.

164
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,071
This building has been vacant

165
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,491
since being claimed by the city
under eminent domain four years ago.

166
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,364
Do you have any comment on
the FBI investigating you

167
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,527
on murder charges?

168
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,410
- We're not gonna talk about that.
- Except to say it's a load of crap.

169
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,742
By offering subsidized leasing to
Markovia's Vortex Industries,

170
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,624
they're gonna be able to create
a high-tech factory here,

171
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:06,298
bringing, at the very least,
800 new jobs to Star City.

172
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,717
Can you shed light on
the accusation of being the Green Arrow?

173
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,795
You have said you're not
the Green Arrow, then who is?

174
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,425
- Why are you being...
- Guys, enough!

175
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,924
If we're not here

176
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,139
to discuss the Markovian initiative,

177
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,928
then you can just
get back on the bus,

178
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,514
because I will not,
for the last time,

179
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,853
be answering questions
on the Green Arrow.

180
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,151
But I'd be happy to.

181
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,067
Alec Tarkov. I'm the Vortex CEO.

182
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,982
And if your mayor is
truly a superhero,

183
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,113
which seems ludicrous...

184
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,493
Thank you.

185
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,286
We will double our investment.

186
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,285
A safe city is a good place
to do business, no?

187
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,868
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Mr. Tarkov,

188
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,204
but not even my son considers me
much of a superhero.

189
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,665
Get down! Go for cover!

190
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,876
Get to the van! Go! Come on!

191
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,756
Get up. Go!

192
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,010
Get to the van! Go! Come on!

193
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,645
Go, go, go!

194
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,389
Hurry up!

195
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,109
Go on. Hit it. Go!

196
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,034
All right, hold on! Hold on!

197
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,959
Is everyone okay?

198
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,342
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

199
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,508
Hope you are having pleasant day.

200
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,980
You look like maybe you want
to throw a punch at me.

201
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,522
Don't worry. We are not here for you.

202
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,948
We have business
with our Markovian cousins.

203
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,651
These are legitimate businessmen.

204
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,997
I never said my business
was not legitimate.

205
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,622
Unless, you know something
maybe a mayor should not know?

206
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,470
We'll be in touch.

207
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,439
Are you okay?

208
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,980
My best friend is under a microscope

209
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,192
by everyone in this city and the FBI.

210
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,652
So he couldn't stop the Bratva
from taking hostages.

211
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,779
So, let's just assume I'm not.

212
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,075
I wasn't talking about
what's going on with Oliver.

213
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,911
Dinah, I'm fine.

214
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,625
The only thing that's
really bothering me,

215
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,081
is you being up in my business.

216
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,339
Hey, we came as soon as we heard.

217
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,971
We need to know why
Anatoly took the Markovians

218
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,299
and we need to find him now.

219
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,600
Oliver, Felicity and Curtis are on
this but you need to stay here.

220
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,552
Look, I know I said before
Chase could be behind this

221
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,230
- but now I'm thinking...
- It's Anatoly.

222
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,023
He leaked the photo to tie my hands.

223
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,934
We're on this. We'll take care of it.

224
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,403
- SQL or Java?
- What?

225
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:22,077
In your job, as a secret programmer.
Are you coding in SQL or Java?

226
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,656
Both. Plus, a little SWIFT.

227
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,410
I can't believe you've had
a secret job this whole time

228
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,582
and you didn't even tell me about it.

229
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,332
Is this relevant to locating
the Bratva and/or their hostages?

230
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,003
I am multitasking.
Thank you very much.

231
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,171
And yes, if you must know,

232
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,966
I am running my image analysis
algorithm on the photo of Oliver.

233
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,674
What, get something?

234
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,756
Just my algorithm
crapping out again.

235
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,966
Don't despair.

236
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,052
I think I might have a line
on our friend Anatoly.

237
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,812
Now, working on the assumption

238
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,981
that he hasn't been
in town that long,

239
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,433
I wondered how he was fixed for cash.

240
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,984
I bet his Bratva buddies
are good for it, no?

241
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,603
Well, he has to pay them somehow.

242
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,359
Cash would set off
too many alarm bells,

243
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,984
plus he'd have to
convert it from rubles.

244
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,360
Credit cards are way too
easy to track. But then there's...

245
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,159
Crypto-currency is virtually
impossible to track.

246
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,956
For mere mortals.

247
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,877
But we're Mr. Terrific and Overwatch.

248
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,705
Overwatch and Mr. Terrific.

249
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,343
No, I can assure you.

250
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,011
- We're doing everything...
- We haven't determined the motive

251
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,759
- to the kidnapping.
- ...to recover the hostages back.

252
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,556
But the police are working
around the clock.

253
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,178
- All right?
- Thank you, Minister.

254
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,010
Yes, that's right.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

255
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,268
The Markovian consulate
is losing their minds.

256
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,893
It's the same
with the Vortex home office.

257
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,850
They wanna send private security
to get their people back.

258
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,936
I told them we've got it
handled, but...

259
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,146
It felt like you were lying?

260
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,280
Where are we with the SCPD?

261
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,779
Dinah's got people rounding up
every Russian thug

262
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,952
with a record, but they're
shorthanded down there.

263
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,992
We got a new problem.

264
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,450
<i>We received an anonymous message</i>

265
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,410
<i>from the group
claiming responsibility</i>

266
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,494
<i>for today's abduction</i>

267
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,252
<i>of the contingent of
executives from Markovia.</i>

268
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,550
<i>In what can only be
a small consolation,</i>

269
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,719
<i>the mayor and the reporters
at the delegation</i>

270
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,011
<i>- were not among the kidnapped.</i>
- Lady's getting a lot of

271
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,133
anonymous messages these days.

272
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,136
<i>As for what exactly
this group wants,</i>

273
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,640
<i>they said they will
execute the hostages in 12 hours</i>

274
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,767
<i>unless the city pays them
a ransom of $20 million.</i>

275
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,939
<i>Mayor Queen could not be reached
for comment.</i>

276
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,983
- Rene.
<i>- In related...</i>

277
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,774
My comment is we don't negotiate
with terrorists.

278
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,325
Yeah, but if we did,
we've got $20 million

279
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,118
from the reconstruction
of the police department.

280
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:31,199
It's funny that's the exact number
your buddy Anatoly chose.

281
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,875
I don't care what number he chose.
We're not paying him 20 cents.

282
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,247
Yeah.

283
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,839
<i>This is he.</i>

284
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,468
Is he okay?

285
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,926
No, of course. Of course.

286
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,141
I have to go.

287
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,771
Wanna tell me what happened?

288
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,189
No.

289
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,910
Did you see who hit you?

290
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,033
Your teacher was saying
it could've been a couple of kids.

291
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,877
Buddy, I can't help you
if you don't...

292
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,296
They know you're the Green Arrow.

293
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,755
- What?
- They said you're the Green Arrow.

294
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,007
They said you're not here to help me.

295
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,136
Oh, man. Look...

296
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,603
- William, I'm really sorry...
- They were really big.

297
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,929
Eighth graders.

298
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,985
Eighth graders, huh?

299
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,485
You should go for the nose.

300
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,150
What?

301
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,906
If something like this happens again,

302
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,375
go for the nose.

303
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,583
Find the biggest one,
the biggest one in the group.

304
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,413
Walk right up to him
without saying a thing

305
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,999
and punch him the nose
as hard as you possibly can.

306
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,302
He will have no idea
what is going on.

307
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,755
He won't be able to see.
If he can't see, he can't fight.

308
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,592
And all his buddies, all the guys
that were being so brave,

309
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,801
they will back off.

310
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,306
Trust me on that one.

311
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,472
- But what if...
- Hang on.

312
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,186
- Yeah.
<i>- It's me, hang on a second.</i>

313
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,989
- What was that?
- I had to secure the line.

314
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,945
Curtis and I found Anatoly.

315
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,951
Russian restaurant owned
by a dummy corporation.

316
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,328
Thermal satellite reads
four bodies in an industrial cooler.

317
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,954
Must be the hostages.

318
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,035
That's what we're thinking.

319
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,916
Text me the address.
I'll be there soon.

320
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,418
Stop the car please.

321
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,749
- What are you...
- I gotta get out.

322
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,801
Listen, the driver and security

323
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,379
they're gonna make sure
that you get right home to Raisa.

324
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,055
- But...
- I promise we'll talk about this

325
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,474
when I get home.
But for now, I gotta go.

326
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,560
Listen, please trust me.

327
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,687
Three access points,
north, south and east.

328
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,989
Lance said these guys are
packing some heavy artillery.

329
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,862
- Where's GA?
<i>- Right here.</i>

330
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,739
We thought maybe
you couldn't get away.

331
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,866
It wasn't easy.

332
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,871
Terrific, keep eyes on the perimeter.
Spartan, Canary, occupy the guards.

333
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,085
I'll extract the Markovians.

334
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,993
- There were four of you.
- Alec Tarkov, our CEO. They took him.

335
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,622
- Where?
- They did not tell us.

336
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,664
Spartan, Canary,
we are short one hostage.

337
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,591
- We just did a sweep...
- There's no one else here.

338
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,259
- Overwatch?
- I don't know what happened?

339
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,720
Thermal read four warm bodies inside.
They must have moved one.

340
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,472
In the least surprising news ever,

341
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,479
the Bratva-run restaurant
is lacking in security cams.

342
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,481
Oh, you mean, Russian mobsters
like their privacy?

343
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,561
So, what now?

344
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,899
So now I show you security camera
footage from outside the restaurant.

345
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,235
Okay, where's Anatoly going
with Tarkov?

346
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,740
Well, from this feed, it looks like
he's headed northeast,

347
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,366
but then we lose him
right about there.

348
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,121
We could cross-reference our list of
Bratva crypto-currency activity

349
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,999
with Bratva-owned properties,
see what comes from that direction.

350
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,751
John, Dinah be prepared to hit
whatever location

351
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,001
Felicity and Curtis come up with.

352
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,458
- Copy that.
- What about you?

353
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,464
I have to meet Quentin
and Rene at the FBI.

354
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,762
The agent pursuing the investigation
wants to interview me.

355
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,837
Well, you have a lawyer
for that, right?

356
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,093
Or an army of lawyers,

357
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,640
that would probably be better,
that would work for you?

358
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,716
If you had an army of them.

359
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,143
I don't wanna look like
I have anything to hide.

360
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,219
Where are we with the photo?

361
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,021
Oh, I'm doing a re-code
into Felicity's analysis algorithm.

362
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,270
Should have something
working within an hour

363
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,771
to 30 days, give or take.

364
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,900
Much closer to the hour mark though.

365
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,446
Thank you.

366
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,867
Keep me updated.

367
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,633
Did you always know
you were gonna be FBI?

368
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,972
'Cause I have a little girl
who I think has that potential.

369
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,391
I mean, of course a woman
can do anything a man can.

370
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,764
And why wouldn't they?

371
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,687
Exactly, I mean, they can.

372
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,763
I'm a feminist like that.

373
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,485
Look, it's been over an hour
and my patience is beyond gone.

374
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,313
Actually, you know what,
that's the Mayor himself.

375
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,194
Got a family emergency.
He's at home with the kid.

376
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,491
Look at that.

377
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,746
So, it must be a coincidence
that during his family emergency,

378
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,413
the Green Arrow was spotted rescuing

379
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,582
the Markovian executives
from the Russian mob?

380
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,784
Definitely a coincidence.

381
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,544
Do I really look that stupid?

382
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,580
You don't look stupid at all.

383
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,461
We're really sorry about
keeping you waiting, all right.

384
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,708
But I don't know if you know this,

385
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,215
but the mayor's actually
recently a single dad.

386
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,390
Yes, after the boy's mother died
unexpectedly in a car accident.

387
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,719
Well, most car accidents
are unexpected.

388
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,054
And most leave behind
a car wreck and a body.

389
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,431
The only proof of Ms. Clayton's death

390
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,858
was the accident report
and the autopsy,

391
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,936
both of which
could have been easily faked.

392
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,943
You're not exactly
a very trusting person,

393
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,945
are you, Special Agent Watson?

394
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,197
Trust isn't part
of my job description.

395
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,242
But let me make one thing
clear as glass to you both.

396
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,166
If you're protecting Mr. Queen,
I'll find out.

397
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,460
And I'll have you both
indicted for obstruction.

398
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,209
Now get out of my office.

399
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,665
You've wasted enough of my time.

400
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,127
Let's go.

401
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,089
Hey, William.

402
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,720
That was a gift
from a very good friend of mine.

403
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,176
It's all fake.

404
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,229
Superheroes don't save anyone.

405
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,140
Buddy, I know that I ran out on you.

406
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,021
And I'm sorry,
but people needed help.

407
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,484
I know that you needed help too,
so I'm here.

408
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,485
- Do you wanna learn a few more...
- No.

409
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,442
Because I don't wanna
learn how to fight.

410
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,823
I don't want you
to learn how to fight,

411
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,994
but you can't always
reason with bullies.

412
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,198
You just left me, by myself.

413
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,084
I know. I know, and I'm sorry.

414
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,167
I didn't know
if you were gonna come back.

415
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,590
William, look at me.

416
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,550
I will always come back.

417
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,294
Just like my mom?

418
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,256
- This is different.
<i>- Yeah, it's worse.</i>

419
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,684
Because there's a million psychos
always trying to kill you.

420
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,763
- I can handle them.
- What if you can't?

421
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,682
Then I'll be alone. I'll have nobody.

422
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,945
You wouldn't understand.

423
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,774
I do understand.

424
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,653
I lost my mom.

425
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,325
And I lost my dad.

426
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,961
And I was a lot older
than you are now,

427
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,288
but I remember exactly how it feels.

428
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,459
<i>It's sad. It's scary.</i>

429
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,420
And it's lonely.

430
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,178
And I swear to God
I will never let that happen to you.

431
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,009
It's not up to you.

432
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,646
I'm sorry, it's work.

433
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,607
Which work?

434
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,164
<i>Hello, Oliver.</i>

435
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,542
- Anatoly, why are you doing this?
<i>- I need money.</i>

436
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,094
And from what I understand,
your city recently

437
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,388
came into possession of $20 million.

438
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,465
There are plenty of cities in Russia.

439
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,055
Mmm. True. Beautiful ones.

440
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,388
But, you see, I have been exiled.

441
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,107
<i>Apparently, Bratva
thinks I am too weak,</i>

442
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,689
<i>due to my friendship with you.</i>

443
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,108
<i>So now, I show everyone.</i>

444
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,690
I am not weak.

445
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,910
And you and I, no longer friends.

446
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,538
<i>I know sometimes you need
persuasion to do the right thing.</i>

447
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,614
<i>So I help you.</i>

448
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,877
<i>This nice man has paralysis
of muscles,</i>

449
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,127
<i>soon will have lung collapse,
and not be able to breathe.</i>

450
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,674
<i>This happens in maybe three hours.</i>

451
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,176
Now, I have cure for his problems.

452
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,716
<i>Do you have cure for mine?</i>

453
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,730
All right, so you got this
off Oliver's phone?

454
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,648
- Five minutes ago, yeah.
- Any clues?

455
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,396
Wait, look at his face.

456
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,149
- I was trying really hard not to.
- What is that?

457
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,235
If we can analyze the facial rash, we
might be able to diagnose the poison.

458
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,532
Find the right cure. On it.

459
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,985
Anatoly said Tarkov
has maybe three hours.

460
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,411
Yeah, sounds about right.

461
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,280
Got it.

462
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,364
Tetrodotoxin.

463
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,448
That's a neurotoxin.

464
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,284
Yeah, inhibits the firing
of action potentials

465
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,290
preventing the nervous system
from carrying messages

466
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,839
and muscles from flexing
in response to nervous stimulation.

467
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,174
I have no idea what you said
but that doesn't sound good.

468
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,251
Is there a cure?

469
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,007
Yeah, they should have something
down at Starling General.

470
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,009
That's great. All we have to do is
get it to him before the poison

471
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,180
takes over his entire body.

472
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,429
- John
- Starling General, I'm on it.

473
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,680
<i>John, I'm coming with you.</i>

474
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,224
Administer this to the patient,
and it'll neutralize the TCCD poison.

475
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,648
I don't wanna know what this is for,
do I?

476
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,068
How long will it take
to reverse the effects?

477
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,482
It starts working immediately

478
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,989
but I'd say 72 hours
until a full recovery.

479
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,068
Thank you, Doctor.

480
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,656
And how are you feeling?

481
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,743
I feel fine.

482
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,791
Excuse me, I have a patient.

483
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,460
Keep taking those pain meds.

484
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,757
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,713
It seems like you have another
chance to lie to me again.

486
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,801
I'm not lying.

487
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,975
I'm telling you this is
none of your business.

488
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,899
I'm out in the field with you
at less than 100%.

489
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,646
This is damn well my business.

490
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,315
And it's Oliver's.

491
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,149
What doesn't he know?

492
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,321
In Lian Yu, Felicity and I
got caught in one of the explosions.

493
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,915
- I thought you guys were fine.
- Felicity was.

494
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,330
But I caught some shrapnel.

495
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,712
- And didn't tell anybody?
- Thea was comatose.

496
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,920
Samantha dead. I was low priority.

497
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,967
John, that was five months ago.

498
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,095
Dr. Schwartz said
I have nerve damage.

499
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,763
Degenerative.

500
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,437
That's why you haven't been
pulling your gun.

501
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,685
Dinah, I have this handled.

502
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,983
Yeah? Why don't you
tell that to Rene?

503
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,894
He ended up in the hospital

504
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,480
because you couldn't even
get a single shot off.

505
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,814
It's just a tremor.

506
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,191
I can manage it.

507
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,322
I'm a soldier, Dinah.

508
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,821
Soldiers push through.

509
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,207
So what, I'm just supposed
to lie to everybody now

510
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,283
just like you've been doing?

511
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,165
You have to do
whatever you have to do.

512
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,465
But I'm asking you, please...

513
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,002
Will you trust me on this one?

514
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,341
We should get going.

515
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,303
I know Python.

516
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,607
- Super villain?
- No, the programming language.

517
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,019
Look, maybe you could send some
of your freelance coding my way?

518
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,979
Look, I think that'll be a waste
of your prodigious talents.

519
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,986
Felicity, you are a...
Son of a bitch!

520
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,701
Not really a son, Curtis,
more of a...

521
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,903
No, I'm talking about this.

522
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,159
I revised your photo analysis
algorithm and got back this.

523
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,708
What? That's impossible.

524
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,535
Data analysis doesn't lie, Felicity.

525
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,915
Question is, what do we do with it?

526
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,666
What's that?
Come on, no more bombshells.

527
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,547
I can't handle any more
for the rest of the night.

528
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,086
It's not a bombshell, Curtis.

529
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,842
It may just be the key
to the Bratva's location.

530
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,385
What are you doing here?

531
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,062
Working, obviously,
what are you doing here?

532
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,060
Felicity and Curtis are
working on locating Tarkov.

533
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,482
He has maybe an hour left.

534
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,150
So, why aren't you home with William?

535
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:12,985
Sorry if I hit a nerve.

536
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,738
When have you ever been sorry
about hitting a nerve?

537
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,068
That's a fair point.

538
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,121
- Speaking of William...
- Yeah?

539
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,452
We received a person of interest
list from Agent Watson.

540
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,543
- She wants to interrogate my son?
- He's an alibi.

541
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,207
And probably not a very good liar.

542
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,090
Absolutely not.
She's not going anywhere near him.

543
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,713
I don't think that's up to you.

544
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,343
I'm going to use
every single thing in my power

545
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,641
to keep him as far away
from this as possible.

546
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,598
This...

547
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,356
This kid has been through enough.

548
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,024
All right, um...

549
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,782
Lance told me about
what happened at school.

550
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,862
Kids are mean.

551
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,201
He's not worried about bullies.

552
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,666
He's worried about me.

553
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,879
He thinks I'm gonna
make him an orphan.

554
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,128
Damn.

555
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,926
I told him,
I said, "That will not happen.

556
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,421
"I will always come back."

557
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,179
I have never lied to my kid before.

558
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,227
You know...

559
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,813
I'm not exactly father of the year...

560
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:40,982
But...

561
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,867
White lies are kind of, like,
an important parental tool.

562
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,575
I remember telling Zoe
that she came from a cloud.

563
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,837
I really hope her mom
set her straight on that one.

564
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,715
<i>So, help me with this.</i>

565
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,461
How do I reconcile

566
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,758
that he's right?

567
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,804
Because every time
that I'm in the field,

568
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,144
there's a chance I don't come back.

569
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:12,893
And then he's alone.

570
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,817
And now you're telling me

571
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,109
that he's gonna have to lie
to an FBI agent

572
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,278
so that he doesn't
lose his father to prison?

573
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,493
We have Anatoly's location.

574
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,878
All right, you go out
the back entrance.

575
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,209
I'll lose him.

576
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,336
Rene, are you good
to get back in the field?

577
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,541
Hells yeah.

578
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,048
All right.

579
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,465
Team's in position.

580
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,675
You sure this is the place?

581
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,223
Oh-ho! I am so insulted right now.

582
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,305
Easy, it's just that
an abandoned shipyard

583
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,889
doesn't feel like Anatoly's speed.

584
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,599
Yeah, well,
neither is being a complete jerk.

585
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,683
People change.

586
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:58,985
The problem is this place is massive.

587
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,688
So, I can't pinpoint the location of
the hostage, even with satellite.

588
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,241
Figure we'll split up.

589
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,618
I distributed the antidote,
so whoever gets to Tarkov first

590
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,990
can inject him.

591
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,322
You okay?

592
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,951
Yeah, I'm fine, let's do this.

593
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,843
If one of us spots Tarkov,
we should have a signal.

594
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,428
Yeah, I was gonna go with
something like, "I see him."

595
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,104
Or maybe even, "Hey, over there."

596
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,807
Not terribly original, but effective.
What if we spot the Bratva?

597
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,982
How about, "Heads up?"

598
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:40,981
Heads up!

599
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,447
- You okay?
- Look out!

600
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,262
I asked for
20 million specifically

601
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,638
because I know you had it.

602
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,688
You'd trade this man's life
for a new police station?

603
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,893
Not exactly.

604
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,855
I do not think you understand how
this whole rescue thing works.

605
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,572
No, I think I do.

606
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,279
Some sort of antidote?

607
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,954
Very clever.

608
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,700
Now step away from him, Anatoly.

609
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,918
He's not a part of this.

610
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,624
I made him part of this.

611
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,341
And I never got my money.

612
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,094
What the hell has happened to you?

613
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,759
- Not even Gregor would've done that!
- Yes, he would have.

614
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,807
You never saw because
you were too naive.

615
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,887
You still are.

616
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,975
- We were friends.
- Yes.

617
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,435
But I see how you treat your friends.

618
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,859
No, Anatoly. No.

619
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,027
This is on you.

620
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,114
- You used to be an honorable man.
- I am an honorable man.

621
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,414
Did I have bomb
planted in your son's school?

622
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,078
Did I have him kidnapped?

623
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,002
Tortured? No.

624
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,834
Because even though we stand apart,

625
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,425
I am still good man.

626
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,600
I wonder.

627
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,053
What would happen to William

628
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,273
if you ran afoul of someone
who is not good?

629
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,904
Anatoly!

630
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,779
- Don't you move.
- Don't bluff.

631
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,198
We have been here before.

632
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,452
We both know you will not kill me.

633
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,301
Why did you leak that picture of me?

634
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,132
As <i>Kapiushon?</i>

635
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,055
I did not.

636
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,385
I told you.

637
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,056
I am honorable man.

638
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,151
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

639
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,995
I can always make time
for the subject of my investigation.

640
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,998
But I should advise you
have a lawyer present.

641
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,538
Why do I need a lawyer?
I haven't done anything wrong.

642
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,457
You know the kind of person
who says that?

643
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,789
- No.
- The kind that needs a lawyer.

644
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,552
Agent Watson, if you feel
the need to investigate me,

645
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,097
I am more than happy to open up
my entire life to you.

646
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,433
With the exception of my son.

647
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,769
He's off-limits.

648
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,268
You're aware that
telling an FBI agent

649
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,771
how to conduct their investigation
is obstruction of justice.

650
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,102
If I really am the man that
you think I am,

651
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,403
how far do you think
such a man would go

652
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,652
to keep his son
from being scrutinized

653
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,028
by the FBI?

654
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,749
- Ms. Watson?
- A little busy here.

655
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,870
There's something on the news
that you need to see.

656
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,299
<i>Channel 52 just received
exclusive evidence</i>

657
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,878
<i>which conclusively establishes
that the photograph of Mayor Queen</i>

658
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,056
<i>as the Green Arrow
was digitally doctored.</i>

659
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,009
<i>This is the second time that
Mayor Queen has faced allegations</i>

660
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,062
<i>of being a vigilante and twice
he has been exonerated.</i>

661
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,230
- Lucky you.
- Not really.

662
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,308
Like I said...

663
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,063
I'm not the man you think I am.

664
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,940
No, Mr. Queen, I think you are.

665
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,607
And if you think this means
I'm dropping my investigation,

666
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,408
then you're the one who's mistaken.

667
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,820
You should do whatever
it is you have to.

668
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,411
<i>The evidence received by Channel 52
showing that Mr. Queen's face</i>

669
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,541
<i>had been placed
on the Green Arrow's body</i>

670
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,795
<i>was received earlier today
from an unknown source...</i>

671
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,000
Nailed it.

672
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,505
You know, I don't wanna
sound arrogant,

673
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,883
but we may very well be the smartest
human beings on the planet.

674
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,181
Oh, well, it's not arrogant
if it is accurate.

675
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,633
Yeah. True that.

676
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,598
And you still find the time
to look bummed out. Crazy.

677
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,314
I mean, our photo analysis
algorithm was right, right?

678
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,813
The photo of Oliver was doctored.

679
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,977
- So...
- So? What's the problem?

680
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,654
So, who would want to frame
Oliver for being the Green Arrow?

681
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,190
Wow.

682
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,780
Way to kill the mood.

683
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,452
- Sorry.
- No, listen.

684
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,904
That is future us' problem.

685
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,741
I'm not gonna, like, let you take
away my buzz right now, okay.

686
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,451
Present us is only worried about

687
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,081
you quitting your
nobody-told-about job.

688
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,413
When are you gonna let that go?

689
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,622
When you go into business with me.

690
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,548
I'm sorry, go into what with you?
Wait, what?

691
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,592
Work with me on this.
We work so well together.

692
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,298
Okay, that
photographic analysis algorithm

693
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,845
is just one of many in a long list

694
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,139
of amazing tech that
you and I have collaborated on.

695
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,182
Think about all the good we could do.

696
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,386
All the cool stuff we could do.
All the cool things we could make.

697
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,055
Please don't say no.

698
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,271
- Yes.
- Oh, thank God, good.

699
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,319
Because I already
filed the paperwork.

700
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,360
Oh, man, this is so cool.

701
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,948
We'll be like Woz and Jobs,
like, back in '76.

702
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,198
Wait. Who's Woz and who's Jobs?

703
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,906
- Shotgun Jobs!
- Shotgun Jobs!

704
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,120
Hey.

705
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,252
Can we talk for a second?

706
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,044
There's nothing to talk about.

707
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,474
We both know that's not true, Dinah.

708
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,679
What do we both know?

709
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,109
I need you to say it.

710
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,235
You nearly got killed last night
because you couldn't rely on me.

711
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,446
- Because you're compromised.
- I know.

712
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,861
I know.

713
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,626
Things just got worse
than I was willing to admit.

714
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,213
That's okay.

715
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,338
But what are you gonna do about it?

716
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,136
Tell Oliver.

717
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,936
Go from there.

718
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,104
- You're home early.
- So I am.

719
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,653
I'm hoping to make that
more of a regular thing.

720
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,780
If that's okay with you.

721
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:28,907
Whatever.

722
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,116
I would like to apologize.

723
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,410
For what?

724
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:40,248
For making you a promise
I wasn't 100% sure I could keep.

725
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,429
You were right, and I was wrong.

726
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,859
Raisa said you have a hard time
admitting when you're wrong.

727
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,111
You have no idea.

728
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,615
Buddy, I heard what you said
in the limo and I hear you.

729
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,118
But I also meant what I said.

730
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:19,329
I am going to do
everything in my power, forever,

731
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,467
to make sure that you never
end up alone in this world.

732
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,171
And I know that you think that
that's not up to me.

733
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,384
And that's a fair, smart, point.

734
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,429
Which is why I think...

735
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,145
I found a way
so that maybe it can be.

736
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,856
- How?
- I'm working on the details.

737
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:48,112
I want you to believe me when I say
that I'm trying to make it happen.

738
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,359
All right?

739
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,033
One more thing.

740
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,707
I promise

741
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,411
that I will do my best
every single day

742
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,416
to be the very best father
that I can be.

743
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,053
And that I know how to be.

744
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,141
That promise is 100%.

745
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,352
Okay.

746
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,738
Wanna play with me?

747
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,035
- What is this?
- Honestly, I don't know.

748
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,209
All you got to do is just button mash
and see where we can win.

749
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,618
All right, let me try.

750
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,829
- Yeah.
- All right.

751
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,094
Thanks for meeting me.

752
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,474
Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you
about a few things.

753
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,100
What is it, Oliver?

754
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,233
I'd like you to do something for me.

755
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,614
If it's suit up as Green Arrow,

756
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,441
Felicity and I already talked
about it and we don't think

757
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,776
it's enough to take
the heat off of you.

758
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,986
That's not what I'm asking.

759
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,156
You're serious?

760
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,497
Every time, that I'm out there
as the Green Arrow,

761
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,873
I'm a target.

762
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,540
Of the FBI, of the Bratva...

763
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,713
Of the threats that are out there

764
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,466
and the threats that are
undoubtedly coming.

765
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,387
And on my own,

766
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,261
I can take it.

767
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,478
I'm not on my own anymore.

768
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,147
I cannot be responsible

769
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:56,695
for my son losing
the only parent that he has left.

770
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,998
- Oliver...
- Star City needs the Green Arrow.

771
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,661
It just can't be me anymore.

772
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,624
So, I'd like it to be you.
