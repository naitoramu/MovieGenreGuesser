1
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:13,966
May your neighbors respect you...

2
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,971
trouble neglect you...

3
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:22,725
the angels protect you...

4
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:27,896
and heaven accept you. Mmm?

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,898
To better days.

6
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:31,650
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

7
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:35,320
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, who is that guy?

8
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:36,905
- Easy, lads.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

9
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,450
Finn.

10
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:42,703
Caught the first flight soon as I heard.

11
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:45,330
Yeah...

12
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,915
Terrible circumstances.

13
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,127
But it sure is good to see you.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,545
Be a good lad.

15
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,340
Go fetch our friend Finn a drink.

16
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:04,600
It's Rory...

17
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:07,227
isn't it?

18
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,241
This is him, then?

19
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,841
I didn't want him
to follow my footsteps...

20
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,094
but he insisted.

21
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:43,972
He came over to make his fortune
and now, look.

22
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:47,726
Two cents to his name.

23
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,067
He was a good kid, Finn.

24
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:57,945
And now he's dead.

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,260
You know, maybe you've been
out of the game too long to remember.

26
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:28,225
Death... is part of the deal.

27
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,860
Leave it, leave it.

28
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,580
Holy shit.

29
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,838
Jesus...

30
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:18,400
Cheers.

31
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:20,693
Yous all all right, yeah?

32
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:21,862
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

33
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:23,030
Yeah.

34
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:25,657
Now, this bloody shooter,

35
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,119
he stole $1.2 million of my money.

36
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:31,789
Man takes my son.
I lose a boy.

37
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:35,667
He takes my money.

38
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,795
I'm getting it back.

39
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:39,379
We will beat every mother's son
in this city

40
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,131
till I have my money in my hands,

41
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:44,802
and this shooter's on his knees, alive.

42
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:48,096
Or there'll be more of you
shining the inside of a box!

43
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:54,436
Do you hear me?

44
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:55,854
Get out!

45
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:58,398
Get out! Move! Let's go!

46
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,113
That bastard shooter
that massacred our brothers.

47
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:06,739
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

48
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,162
New faces.

49
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:14,247
Military training.

50
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:16,291
- Think fast!
- I don't know! Wait, wait!

51
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:18,460
Wait! I might have seen one guy!

52
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:23,631
Hey, excuse me! Yeah, you.
How's it going, huh?

53
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:26,509
- Oh, Jesus.
- You having a good day?

54
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:29,012
We're looking for a customer.

55
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:31,223
- What?
- Wears a jacket...

56
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,766
even in the middle of summer,
or so they say.

57
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,853
I... I mean...

58
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:42,192
Now, I count two ankles,
two knees, one elbow.

59
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,444
And guess what?
I got five more rounds.

60
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:45,946
I don't...

61
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:48,073
I think I know.
Has a dog, right?

62
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:51,409
Came in here.
I even saw him walk it once.

63
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,203
Elaborate.

64
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:58,000
Aw.

65
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:00,377
Sit.

66
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,005
Search the closets.

67
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:04,797
Dog's one of ours.
This is the place.

68
00:05:04,882 --> 00:05:07,259
- Nah, it's empty.
- Find my goddamn money.

69
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:09,386
You heard him.
Let's go!

70
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,226
He's not one for fancy living, is he?

71
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,145
Pull that up.

72
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:19,479
Shut that damn dog up!

73
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:22,232
Hey! Knock it off!

74
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:24,817
Uh, nothing...
but it ain't money.

75
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:26,569
The money's not here.

76
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,495
That's who you are.

77
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:38,916
Move it.

78
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:20,517
- Hi.
- Hey.

79
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,561
- I'm just about ready.
- Okay.

80
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:35,365
- Uh, here, let me help with that.
- Oh, thanks.

81
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:36,783
- It's okay.
- Oh.

82
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,701
Sorry.

83
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,376
- You okay?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,298
I'm just, uh...

85
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:54,259
recovering.

86
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,803
From what?

87
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,933
I don't really know the name for it.

88
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,894
But... you're feeling better?

89
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:07,189
Yeah.

90
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,316
Now.

91
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:12,860
With you.

92
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:22,954
Not that I can verify,
but you seem good at this.

93
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,668
Uh, well, my brother wasn't,
so that's where I came in.

94
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,071
You never said you had a brother.

95
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,005
Uh... you never asked.

96
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:41,389
- Uh, thank you.
- Mmm.

97
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:43,516
Come on. It's about time.

98
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,149
"Precious in the eyes
of the Lord...

99
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,361
is the death of his saints."

100
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,490
Well...

101
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:02,034
Elliot Grote was no saint.

102
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:04,829
He was human...

103
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:08,708
deeply flawed.

104
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:13,671
Every Sunday,
for as far as I remember...

105
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:18,050
Elliot would come here...

106
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,346
friendless and alone...

107
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,722
to sit.

108
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:26,393
Right there in that pew.

109
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,980
Often, I would see him take...

110
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:33,566
whatever money he had...

111
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,112
crumpled one hundreds, loose change...

112
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,282
a Rolex watch one time...

113
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:45,745
and put it in the collection plate...

114
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,207
hoping for redemption.

115
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,295
Which would never come.

116
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:55,672
Praying for the light...

117
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:00,510
but Elliot died still in the dark...

118
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:03,721
with no one to mourn his loss...

119
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:06,308
except the three of you.

120
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,187
And so, we might say...

121
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:13,981
one life gone...

122
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:16,609
one sinful life...

123
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,573
but one person is not just one person.

124
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:25,410
In each of us,
there is a world...

125
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:30,165
webbing out, reaching others.

126
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,836
Creating reactions.

127
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,672
Sometimes equal...

128
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,050
sometimes opposite.

129
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:46,806
We rush to say, one life gone...

130
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,478
but each of us is a world.

131
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:52,854
And today,

132
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:56,858
a world has been lost.

133
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,570
We didn't know him well, but I...

134
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:03,740
never loved the idea of letting
anyone die alone.

135
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,242
He... He wasn't alone?

136
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:10,247
They found him surrounded by
knocked out Dogs of Hell, right?

137
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,749
I get all the bad guys
confused these days.

138
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:16,794
Didn't think it could get much worse
out there, the violence, but...

139
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:20,298
What if I meet you back at the office?
I'm just gonna take a minute here.

140
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:21,758
Yeah, sure.

141
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:34,020
- It was a nice sermon.
- Thank you.

142
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:39,484
Most priests would have found something
kind to say about the man himself, but...

143
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,278
I said he came to church.

144
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:46,032
Nothing shines up a halo
faster than a death, Matthew.

145
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:48,159
But funerals are for the living...

146
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:51,663
and revising history...

147
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,165
only dilutes the lessons
we should learn from it.

148
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:55,625
It wasn't my fault.

149
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:59,170
- What wasn't?
- Grotto's death.

150
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,881
- No one said it was.
- Yeah.

151
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:06,719
There's a new man in town, he's, uh...

152
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,596
killing people in cold blood.

153
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,808
Yeah, I read about
what happened with the Irish.

154
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:15,312
Must have been a...
busy couple nights.

155
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:16,854
Yeah, I did everything I could to...

156
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,108
uh, protect my client.

157
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:24,278
- That work is done, Matthew.
- Because I failed.

158
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:25,947
At least you tried.

159
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,408
Well, like you said,
his life had value.

160
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:31,703
A whole world's been lost
and others are dying one after the other...

161
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:33,538
Matthew, what are you looking for?

162
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:38,668
- Forgiveness.
- For what?

163
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,257
Uh... not doing more?

164
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:47,344
You just said
you did everything you could.

165
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,305
If you're the man I understand you to be,
I'm sure that's true.

166
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,935
Then why do I still feel guilty?

167
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:04,486
Guilt can be a good thing.

168
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:07,364
It's the soul's call to action.

169
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,492
The indication that...

170
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,577
something is wrong.

171
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:14,912
The only way...

172
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:18,750
to rid your heart of it...

173
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,044
is to correct your mistakes
and keep going...

174
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:23,755
until amends are made.

175
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:29,051
I don't know what you didn't do
or what you should have done...

176
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:31,846
but the guilt...

177
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:34,807
the guilt...

178
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,521
means your work is not yet finished.

179
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:43,315
Thank you.

180
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,591
<i>He's lucky to be alive.</i>

181
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:53,385
This is all of the stuff
that the DA's collecting for her case.

182
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,763
And most of it's about
the Punisher's victims.

183
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:58,224
The Dogs of Hell, the cartel...

184
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:00,392
But this was in the middle of it.

185
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:02,394
Not someone he shot, him.

186
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:05,815
He's insane.
Maybe he shot himself.

187
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:08,443
I thought about that,
but at that close of a range...

188
00:15:08,526 --> 00:15:10,027
Yeah, he'd be dead already.

189
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:12,530
Okay, not to go all tin-foil hat here,

190
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:15,116
but Tower obviously
slipped this to me for a reason.

191
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,119
What if the Punisher
isn't the worst of it?

192
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,622
What if Reyes is trying
to cover something up?

193
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:24,792
You think that murderous
psychopath isn't the worst of it?

194
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,962
No. And I think our best shot
at protecting Nelson and Murdock

195
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,589
is to find him.

196
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,382
It's our best shot
at career suicide...

197
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,385
or just getting shot.

198
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:39,599
- Am I insane?
- Nelson and Murdock.

199
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:42,769
- Matt?
- Sorry, what?

200
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,062
Nothing, just...

201
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,565
Father Lantom's eulogy
really got to me, I guess.

202
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,942
Yeah, he does that.

203
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:51,360
Mmm, Punisher's a lunatic.

204
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:52,987
But you care, anyway?

205
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,907
I wouldn't say that, it's more like...

206
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,076
curious.

207
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,163
In between these files and...
and Reyes' obsession

208
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:06,292
and the fact that humans are a pretty
complicated species to begin with,

209
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,960
I just...

210
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:10,462
I feel like there's gotta be
more to the story.

211
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:14,884
I think you are...

212
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:19,556
Oh, my God, you think I'm insane.

213
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,183
I'm kidding.

214
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:23,560
Compassionate.

215
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,940
- Hmm.
- It's a good quality, Karen.

216
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,316
Stuff of saints.

217
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,069
Yeah, well, I'm no saint.

218
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:35,487
I can't tell you
how glad I am to hear that.

219
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:38,908
Matt!

220
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:43,913
We have real, live,
non-criminal clients who need our help.

221
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:46,666
- Excuse me for a second.
- Yeah.

222
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,591
Tell me.

223
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,384
Mr. DiPesta defaced the elevator
in his building.

224
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,068
Which, technically,
makes him a criminal.

225
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:02,974
That's what his slumlord, excuse me,
landlord says, but look.

226
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:05,935
He's got no AC, no hot water.

227
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:08,187
This has Nelson and Murdock
written all over it.

228
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,689
But we gotta file today.

229
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:11,315
Karen!

230
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:22,368
- Maybe she stepped out.
- Did she take the files?

231
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:23,661
- Huh?
- From Reyes.

232
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:24,829
The... the Punisher files.

233
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:26,288
Oh, shit.

234
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:30,793
I have to find her.

235
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:33,504
Find him first.

236
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:48,770
You're early.

237
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:52,189
You know
I don't like being rushed.

238
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,193
- I need the suit, Melvin.
- Yeah, I figured.

239
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:05,452
You know, you getting popped in the noggin

240
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:09,040
gave me a chance to try some new stuff
and I'm pretty excited about it.

241
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,253
Fortified, carbon tube helmet.

242
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:17,173
I mean, it's pretty damn close
to indestructible.

243
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:19,926
- How close?
- I'll leave the testing to you.

244
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:22,219
I threw in some reinforced alloy gloves.

245
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:25,181
You know, what the hell.
Gotta be careful.

246
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,599
Some new people
spilling a lot of blood out there.

247
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:28,685
Who?

248
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:30,144
Don't know.

249
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:32,988
But all my old contacts are showing up
again begging me to outfit 'em.

250
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:35,524
Did you?

251
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:39,611
No, I don't do that anymore.
I turned them all away.

252
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,285
- Oh, you look better.
- Yeah, I feel better.

253
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:48,287
Glad you're on the mend.

254
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,664
So am I.

255
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,709
Well, stay safe out there,
will you?

256
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,836
Thanks, Melvin. You too.

257
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,254
Oh, I'm not taking any chances.
Check this out.

258
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:58,673
Huh?

259
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,591
Gotta stay strong for Betsy.

260
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,221
You wanna take a look?
I mean, it's pretty wicked.

261
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:08,349
I'm gonna take your word for it.

262
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,277
Uh, George Buck?

263
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:25,241
Hi, the hospital told me
I might find you here.

264
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:28,870
Hi, uh... are you one of them?

265
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,205
Sorry, one of who?

266
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:32,289
Please, just leave me alone.

267
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:34,375
I'm not gonna
do anything to you.

268
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,211
If anything, I'd like to help
you get your job back.

269
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:40,798
Look, I need to understand why you were

270
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,259
fired from Metro-General
in the first place.

271
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:48,597
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?

272
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:52,101
You were with him when this was taken?

273
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:54,812
Yeah. That bullet tore through his head.

274
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:58,858
Not many people survive that.

275
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:01,610
Well, I'd like to know
what you remember.

276
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:03,780
John Doe.

277
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:05,572
Guy was a total vegetable.

278
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:08,325
I guess that's why they decided
he only needed one nurse.

279
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,452
Any family or visitors?

280
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:11,788
No.

281
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,039
I mean...

282
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,832
aside from the suits.

283
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,583
- Suits?
- Yeah.

284
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:20,629
Uh, sometimes men,
sometimes women.

285
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:23,424
You can tell 'em 'cause
they all wear the same ear pieces.

286
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:26,343
That and the... black suits.

287
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:29,180
Kind of like... uh...

288
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:32,183
Got any idea who these suits were?

289
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:33,810
No.

290
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,644
Uh, but they had their run of the place

291
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:38,940
and they were the ones
that pushed for the, uh, the DNR.

292
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:41,108
- A "do not resuscitate"?
- Yeah.

293
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,235
They had the paperwork.

294
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,362
And I was there when the doctor
pulled the plug.

295
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,782
I... I'm confused.

296
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:50,201
You're saying this guy died?

297
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,536
Yeah, for about a minute.

298
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:56,457
It's crazy, but they say
it happens sometimes.

299
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,794
You know, one minute,
flatline, then boom.

300
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,879
His heart starts back up again.

301
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:03,965
On its own.

302
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,426
He just didn't wanna die.

303
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,720
Within ten minutes of being awake...

304
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:13,182
he reaches up
and grabs my scrubs,

305
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:16,894
yanks me down,
and says, real close...

306
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,190
"Take me home."

307
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:23,609
I shouldn't have done it.

308
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:26,778
I shouldn't have done it.
I should've known it'd get me fired.

309
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:30,324
His home.

310
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:33,785
Do you have an address?

311
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:43,772
Nice night.

312
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,571
I'm not alone.

313
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:56,160
You wanna come with us?

314
00:22:57,661 --> 00:22:59,788
Or you wanna make a mess?

315
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:16,847
Don't shoot!

316
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,265
We want him alive!

317
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:21,477
Who, who needs me alive?

318
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,145
- Drop it! Drop it!
- Drop it!

319
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:25,647
Calm down! Everyone, calm down!
No one shoot!

320
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,912
Well, thanks
for thinning out the herd.

321
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,751
You're surrounded, son.

322
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,380
Now be a good lad and drop the iron.

323
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:55,136
Come on.

324
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:57,429
You seem like a smart one.

325
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:33,049
- Tell Carter we're about done here.
- Got it.

326
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:35,842
We're finishing up the murder scene
at Stanley's bar. Over.

327
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:37,844
<i>Copy.</i>

328
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,169
I need to know
what happened here.

329
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:12,546
I'm not telling you shit.

330
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:15,466
You helped us catch Fisk,
that don't make us friends.

331
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,885
Was this the Punisher?

332
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:21,430
Jesus.

333
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:22,848
The Irish, okay?

334
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,559
To find the Punisher.
They put a bounty on his head.

335
00:25:25,642 --> 00:25:28,270
Now people all over the Kitchen
are getting hurt.

336
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:30,189
It's the goddamn Wild West out there.

337
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:32,065
Have the Irish found him?

338
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:34,485
As long as we keep getting
calls like this, I guess not.

339
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:38,489
Hey, stay out of it.
You hear me?

340
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:41,575
- I just wanna help, Sergeant.
- No, you can't help.

341
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:45,162
You're the problem!
'Cause of you, the uniform means dick.

342
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:48,540
Cops are no longer preventing crime,
we're just chasing it.

343
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:51,210
Mopping up the mess
that you people leave in your wake.

344
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:53,545
We're on the same side,
you and I.

345
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:55,464
You're on your own side.

346
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,177
<i>2-Adam, shots fired.
65th Street transverse, by the carousel.</i>

347
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,720
<i>All units to back.</i>

348
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,848
Fifteen Sergeant responding, Central.

349
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,404
Who did this?

350
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:45,866
People you don't mess with.

351
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:50,287
You're bleeding out.
And I got all night.

352
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,455
Go to hell!

353
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,168
Who did it?

354
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:00,631
The one they call Punisher.

355
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,883
Where is he?

356
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:06,887
It doesn't matter
'cause when we're done with him,

357
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,514
he's as good as dead.

358
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:12,183
That's helpful.

359
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,061
But it's not what I asked.

360
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,921
You're quite an artist
with the AK, aren't ya?

361
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,803
Nesbitt.

362
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:49,888
Kelly...

363
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:53,517
my oldest boy.

364
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:58,188
Every one gone to the angels
because of you.

365
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:02,693
You're dying tonight.

366
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,820
The hole's been dug.

367
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:06,613
But I'm giving you one chance
to meet your maker

368
00:29:06,697 --> 00:29:08,699
with arms and legs attached.

369
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:12,703
Generosity's my defining trait.

370
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:37,436
You care for a nibble?

371
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,521
No?

372
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:42,023
Ah, suit yourself.

373
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:54,244
Helps calm me nerves.

374
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:56,788
I look nervous to you?

375
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,335
Boys.

376
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:03,670
Give us a moment.

377
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,320
I want my money back.

378
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:35,326
Your kid's in a box,
but you want your money. Huh?

379
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:47,673
The Irish may not have invented revenge,

380
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:50,300
but we sure as hell
took some time perfecting it.

381
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:54,555
Don't think you're showing me something
I haven't seen before,

382
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:56,056
'cause your killing spree

383
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:59,142
has all the signs
of a man seeking retribution.

384
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:02,187
Am I right?

385
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:04,440
Okay.

386
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:08,902
Okay.

387
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:11,530
I'll tell you...

388
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:15,200
I'll tell you where your money is.

389
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:17,828
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

390
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:20,539
I promise you, it'll be over soon.

391
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:22,583
In a jiffy.

392
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,501
Come on, yeah?

393
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:28,839
How'd that feel?

394
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,340
Boys, hold him down!

395
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:31,675
Hey...

396
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,640
Come on! Come on!

397
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,396
Oh, I was hoping
it would come to this.

398
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:46,690
Yeah?

399
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:49,025
You gonna do it
or you gonna talk about it?

400
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,444
I'm here!

401
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:54,280
I'll kill every one of you bastards!
Come on, I'll kill you!

402
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:58,994
Where would you like it?
Here, huh? Here?

403
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:05,584
Not such a big man now, are ya?

404
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:35,984
What was that?

405
00:34:46,077 --> 00:34:47,287
Murph?

406
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:50,624
Murph?

407
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:54,628
- Take that side.
- All right.

408
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:55,962
- Keep eyes on.
- All right.

409
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:11,937
All right.

410
00:35:13,104 --> 00:35:14,147
New plan.

411
00:35:16,441 --> 00:35:17,608
Bring him in.

412
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:25,575
Hey...

413
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:28,453
It seems like you've taken
a liking to this mutt.

414
00:35:31,331 --> 00:35:33,750
Good boy, good boy.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

415
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,252
Hey, if I don't get my money...

416
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:39,214
everything I've done to you,

417
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:42,676
I'm doing double to poor Fido here, huh?

418
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:47,806
Huh...

419
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,225
Good boy, good boy, huh.

420
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:55,521
Wait, wait, wait.

421
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,572
Hey, let him go,
just let him go, you asshole.

422
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:06,867
I'll tell you where your money is, okay?
I'll tell you.

423
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,745
Your money's in a van, okay?
It's in a van.

424
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:11,246
It's on 48th and 10th.

425
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:13,915
Just let him...

426
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,501
Just let him go,
you asshole, let him go.

427
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:19,545
He's an animal lover.
That's sweet.

428
00:36:19,629 --> 00:36:20,839
Take him out.

429
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:26,344
Come on, let's go.

430
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:29,097
Now, if you don't mind...

431
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:36,437
I'll keep you alive
until the cash is safe at hand.

432
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:37,522
Yeah?

433
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:47,198
48th and 10th.

434
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:48,533
Yeah, make it quick.

435
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,576
And watch your backside.

436
00:37:06,634 --> 00:37:08,719
Get him.

437
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:19,355
Yeah, I think it went well.

438
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,483
- Yeah, it's the same old story.
- I know, I know. I hear ya.

439
00:37:22,567 --> 00:37:25,236
- What are you gonna do about it, right?
- Ah, nothing.

440
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,080
Yeah.

441
00:37:35,163 --> 00:37:36,414
Yeah, I got the case.

442
00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:37,833
Hold on.

443
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,853
Yeah, the money's all here, Mr. Finn.

444
00:37:57,936 --> 00:37:59,336
Wait, wait, there's something else.

445
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,237
Son of a bitch.

446
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:18,331
He's loose.
Get down here.

447
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,043
Jimmy! Shaun!

448
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:24,963
Jimmy!

449
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:29,843
Jimmy! Shaun!

450
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,559
You wanted this.

451
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:41,229
No, I counted on it.

452
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,648
Now I can ask you face to face.

453
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:47,068
Who was there that day?
Who killed my family?

454
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:49,320
- Your family?
- Yeah.

455
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:50,613
- Who cares?
- Move!

456
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:53,158
Move! Go, go, go!

457
00:38:55,243 --> 00:38:56,577
Shoot that son of a bitch!

458
00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:06,922
- We got him! Come on!
- Yeah!

459
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:10,050
- Get down here!
- One batch, two batch.

460
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:12,510
Penny and dime.

461
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:34,740
They're gonna pay.
Every single goddamn one of 'em.

462
00:39:34,824 --> 00:39:35,992
They will.

463
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:38,828
But not tonight. Move.

464
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:41,039
There! That room there.

465
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:13,071
- No killing.
- Altar boy.

466
00:40:22,663 --> 00:40:24,082
All right,
let's get out of here.

467
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:43,203
Come on.

468
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:04,014
Hey.

469
00:42:06,642 --> 00:42:07,852
Not bad.

470
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:09,770
Thanks.

471
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:12,732
I guess I, uh...

472
00:42:13,774 --> 00:42:15,193
I guess I was wrong.

473
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:17,195
About?

474
00:42:18,446 --> 00:42:20,073
About you being a pussy.

475
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:22,117
Don't get all sweet on me now, Frank.

476
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:29,832
- Help's on the way.
- Nah.

477
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,376
You should go.

478
00:42:34,587 --> 00:42:35,838
I'm past saving.

479
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,965
At least I'd have company, right?

480
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:42,470
I think I might cash out.

481
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:48,643
You'd have made a hell of a Marine, Red.

482
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:52,730
That rhyme.

483
00:42:54,649 --> 00:42:56,859
- What's it mean?
- What'd you say?

484
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,029
- Huh?
- Thing you say.

485
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:02,240
Right before you pull the trigger.

486
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:05,034
What do you...

487
00:43:05,118 --> 00:43:06,327
You heard that?

488
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,704
Yeah, I heard it.

489
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:10,248
What the...

490
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:15,044
I gotta say, sometimes...

491
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:19,006
Sometimes I think
you really just might be the devil.

492
00:43:20,466 --> 00:43:22,260
Sometimes I think I might be, too.

493
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:25,888
It's, uh...

494
00:43:27,557 --> 00:43:29,350
One batch, two batch.

495
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:32,687
Penny and dime, you know.

496
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:36,191
It was her favorite book.

497
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:41,446
You know, you...

498
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:45,866
You gotta cross the ocean... and go fight.

499
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,034
You see...

500
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:50,955
whole time you're thinking
you're gonna be scared, right?

501
00:43:51,038 --> 00:43:53,040
But then, you're not.

502
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,461
See, that part of it was
always easy for me.

503
00:43:57,462 --> 00:43:58,588
Killing.

504
00:43:59,755 --> 00:44:02,425
Even watching my buddies die,
it just...

505
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:03,968
it didn't mean nothing.

506
00:44:05,135 --> 00:44:07,597
The first time I got scared...

507
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:11,226
was on a plane on the way home.

508
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:16,689
I kept thinking God was gonna pull the rug
out from under us, you know?

509
00:44:16,772 --> 00:44:18,983
Shit, that's his kind of funny, you know.

510
00:44:21,736 --> 00:44:24,739
But the plane landed safe
and we were home.

511
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:26,407
Driving through traffic.

512
00:44:26,491 --> 00:44:30,578
Yeah, you pass fast food
and donut shops and all that...

513
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:31,787
that greasy shit.

514
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,040
It's the shit you fought to protect
and then the car stops.

515
00:44:37,502 --> 00:44:39,670
We were outside her school.

516
00:44:39,754 --> 00:44:41,756
I get to her classroom, right?

517
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:45,676
She's in there...

518
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48,721
but she's got no idea.

519
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:52,558
She's got no idea that Daddy's home.

520
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:58,523
I walk in, these kids,
they're not even studying, they're...

521
00:44:58,606 --> 00:45:01,442
doing some kind of yoga. Yeah.

522
00:45:01,526 --> 00:45:03,819
You know?

523
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:05,112
She's there.

524
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:07,907
She's doing her poses, you know.

525
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:11,827
She's bending and,
you know, she's moving.

526
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,746
She looks like a flower.

527
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,540
Yeah.

528
00:45:15,623 --> 00:45:17,207
And, you know,
you can't even understand it,

529
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:19,335
you know, how does
something like that have...

530
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:22,547
How does something that beautiful...

531
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:24,882
How does that...

532
00:45:25,883 --> 00:45:28,636
does that come from me, you know?

533
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:32,723
And she looks up and she sees me.

534
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:36,936
I see her.

535
00:45:40,272 --> 00:45:41,857
By God, that's real.

536
00:45:43,025 --> 00:45:45,069
That's real, Red.

537
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:46,321
Boom.

538
00:45:46,404 --> 00:45:48,489
In an instant,
she's across that classroom floor,

539
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:50,240
she's in my arms.

540
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:55,705
She's squeezing me so tight,
I swear I was gonna bust a rib, you know?

541
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:59,417
We just stayed there like that,
we're holding each other.

542
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,294
Teacher, she's filming the whole thing
on her phone, you know,

543
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:05,047
she's gonna put it on
YouTube or some shit.

544
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,133
She can't hold the thing steady,
because, you know, she's...

545
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,845
she's bawling so hard,
and the kids are all wailing,

546
00:46:10,928 --> 00:46:12,179
you know, they're screaming.
And me?

547
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:14,181
Shit, I'm the worst of all.
I'm a...

548
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:17,643
I'm a rubber-face clown,
you know.

549
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:19,311
I cried so hard.

550
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:25,360
But not my baby.

551
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:26,861
Not my girl.

552
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:29,697
You know,
she's my girl. She's...

553
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:33,993
She's not crying,
she's holding me up.

554
00:46:35,745 --> 00:46:38,330
My girl,
she's keeping me on my feet.

555
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,296
She says,
"I knew it, Daddy. I knew it."

556
00:46:48,466 --> 00:46:51,552
And then we go home.
Wife, the boy.

557
00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:53,721
Place is the exact same.

558
00:46:53,804 --> 00:46:57,558
It's like it was just holding its breath
waiting for me to get back, you know?

559
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:01,937
Then it hit me.

560
00:47:02,897 --> 00:47:04,899
All of it, you know.

561
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:10,195
The first time I felt how tired I was,
you know, I was just...

562
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:13,157
tired, you know?

563
00:47:15,993 --> 00:47:18,037
You...

564
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,122
You ever been tired, Red?

565
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:23,208
Yeah.

566
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:24,794
So, you know.

567
00:47:26,045 --> 00:47:27,922
It's just, I couldn't do nothing,
you know?

568
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:29,632
All the things...

569
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:35,888
I couldn't take my wife to bed.

570
00:47:37,347 --> 00:47:39,809
Ball with the boy. Shit...

571
00:47:39,892 --> 00:47:43,103
I was too tired, I couldn't even drink
a goddamn beer, you know.

572
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:45,481
But not her.

573
00:47:46,649 --> 00:47:48,818
My girl was up.

574
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:52,029
See, she wanted me to, uh...

575
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:55,282
she wanted me to tuck her in.
She...

576
00:47:55,365 --> 00:47:57,577
She outgrew it, she knew it,
but she didn't care.

577
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,161
She wanted it.

578
00:48:02,414 --> 00:48:04,041
She had that book.

579
00:48:07,044 --> 00:48:10,005
Her favorite book was out on the pillows.

580
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:14,384
<i>One Batch, Two Batch...
Penny and Dime.</i>

581
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:15,470
Yeah.

582
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:18,222
I read her that book every night
before this shit.

583
00:48:18,305 --> 00:48:20,683
I read it every single night,
but, see, that was over now

584
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:22,768
because Daddy's home now.

585
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:29,316
She looked at me and she begged me, Red.

586
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:32,653
She begged.

587
00:48:33,946 --> 00:48:35,322
She begged.

588
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:42,079
I said, "No.

589
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:49,419
Daddy's too tired, see.

590
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:52,840
But I'll...

591
00:48:52,923 --> 00:48:54,925
I'll read to you tomorrow night.

592
00:48:56,677 --> 00:49:00,931
I'll read to you
tomorrow night, I promise." Yeah.

593
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:05,477
Never think that...

594
00:49:06,604 --> 00:49:09,524
for her there was not gonna be
any tomorrow, see.

595
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:14,111
The last time I'd see her,

596
00:49:14,194 --> 00:49:17,031
I'd be holding her lifeless body
in my arms.

597
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,286
Meat was spilling out of her, Red.

598
00:49:23,621 --> 00:49:25,623
The place where her face used to be.

599
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,504
Yeah.

600
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:37,885
I think I'm done... Red.

601
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:40,345
I think I'm done.

602
00:49:50,773 --> 00:49:52,399
Police. Don't move.

603
00:49:53,943 --> 00:49:55,152
Hands where I can see 'em.

604
00:49:55,235 --> 00:49:57,279
Shots fired.

605
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:58,989
Bodies, mayhem and shit.

606
00:49:59,073 --> 00:50:00,741
How come I just knew it had to be you?

607
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:02,785
I have something for you, Sergeant.

608
00:50:03,744 --> 00:50:05,204
That's him?

609
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:08,624
- Cover him and get EMS.
- Yep.

610
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:12,878
And you,
you incredible pain in my ass.

611
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:14,213
You're under arrest.

612
00:50:14,296 --> 00:50:15,715
Get him help.

613
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:16,841
Shut up.

614
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:19,301
- Take the collar.
- What?

615
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:20,552
You heard me.

616
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:23,764
You caught him, not me.

617
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:25,600
It can't be me,
it has to be you.

618
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:28,310
Why?

619
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:30,605
To protect the Kitchen.

620
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:31,897
For law, for order.

621
00:50:32,815 --> 00:50:34,066
You're telling me
how to file a report now?

622
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:35,359
Yeah. Take the collar.

623
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:36,777
Take the credit.
Get a promotion, if you can.

624
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,061
- You've earned it.
- Bullshit.

625
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:40,322
No, people have to know the system works.

626
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,366
Not his justice and not mine.

627
00:50:43,242 --> 00:50:46,746
Vigilante days are done in this town.
The police are in charge.

628
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:50,457
That's not how it happened.

629
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,752
Then make it how it happened.

630
00:50:55,545 --> 00:50:56,714
Shit.

631
00:50:57,673 --> 00:51:00,425
EMT and backup on the way.
Two minutes out.

632
00:51:01,301 --> 00:51:03,012
Go.

633
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:04,179
Go!

634
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:07,391
I don't know what you are...

635
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:10,269
but I know you ain't him.

636
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:53,979
<i>Frank Castle,</i>

637
00:51:54,063 --> 00:51:56,356
<i>the gunman wanted in connection
with the Metro-General shooting</i>

638
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,943

<i>of the 15th Precinct to thank."</i>

643
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:11,413
Gotta hand it to Brett.

644
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,958
I'm glad people like him
are looking out for Hell's Kitchen.

645
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,042
Yeah.

646
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,669
And I'm glad someone
was looking out for him.

647

Press are calling Castle
"a cold-blooded psychopath."

648

649
00:52:22,967 --> 00:52:25,219
using his prosecution
to turn herself into a hero.

650
00:52:25,302 --> 00:52:27,304
It's all working out perfectly.

651
00:52:28,013 --> 00:52:30,099
- Wow, way to bring us down.
- I'm...

652
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:32,017
Hey, Josie,
would you mind turning the TV off?

653
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:33,602
It's upsetting some of the regulars.

654
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:37,689
I think we've had enough Punisher
for one evening.

655
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:39,649
- Hmm. Okay. I'll drink to that.
- All right?

656
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:43,445
To Brett and... a safe Hell's Kitchen.

657
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:46,240
- Hear, hear.
- Mmm-hmm.

658
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,451
Oh.

659
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:51,161
- I'm gonna get us another round.
- Good.

660
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:52,579
I hope you two saved room for shots.

661
00:52:52,662 --> 00:52:53,914
- Same again.
- Oh, no, no.

662
00:52:53,998 --> 00:52:56,333
Oh, shots.

663
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:57,626
Thanks, Fog.

664
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:04,216
Hey.

665
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:07,011
You okay?

666
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:09,471
Yeah.

667
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:13,600
Okay, that wasn't convincing, was it?

668
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:14,935
Um...

669
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:18,063
I don't know, I just, uh...

670
00:53:19,398 --> 00:53:21,650
days like today...

671
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:25,070
remind me how precious life can be,
you know?

672
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:39,209
What's your brother like?

673
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:43,839
Um...

674
00:53:45,132 --> 00:53:46,591
Uh, he's sweet. He's...

675
00:53:46,675 --> 00:53:48,302
a good brother.

676
00:54:04,234 --> 00:54:05,777
Careful, Matt.

677
00:54:07,029 --> 00:54:08,072
What's that?

678
00:54:08,155 --> 00:54:11,200
Keep going like this,
you just might end up happy.

679
00:54:11,283 --> 00:54:13,743
And for a Catholic boy,
that's a pretty dangerous thing.

680
00:54:15,412 --> 00:54:17,747
I don't know what you're talking about.

681
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:19,541
Godspeed, Matt Murdock.

682
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:20,960
Hey, where next?

683
00:54:21,043 --> 00:54:22,837
Home.

684
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,213
I'm gonna sleep for a week.

685
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:25,976
Someone had the awful idea of doing shots.

686
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:29,134
I think I've had enough excitement
for one evening.

687
00:54:29,218 --> 00:54:31,511
- See you two in the morning.
- Okay. Yeah.

688
00:54:31,595 --> 00:54:33,805
- See ya, Fog.
- Bye.

689
00:54:46,902 --> 00:54:48,153
Do you mind the rain?

690
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,740
No.

691
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:03,961
Then I'll walk you home.

692
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:07,001
- Can I take you to dinner?
- Yes.

693
00:57:09,211 --> 00:57:11,713
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

694
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,099
Good night, Karen.

695
00:57:25,185 --> 00:57:26,811
Good night, Matt.

696
00:58:44,264 --> 00:58:45,890
Hello, Matthew.

697
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:53,232
Elektra.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
