No, I'm fine. Things are just,
um, tense here.

165
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,301
Thank you, Caitlin.

166
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,336
Happy holidays
to you, too.

167
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,405
Are those the DNA results?

168
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,007
It's the reassembled
genome S.T.A.R. Labs

169
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,875
was able to get off of the arrow
that killed Sara.

170
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,443
I need to run it against
potential suspects.

171
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,878
What database
are you using?

172
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,847
SCPD maintains a genetic
markers database.

173
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:12,683
Anyone's who committed
a felony in the past three years.

174
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,118
[Beep]
No, that--

175
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,098
that can't be right.

176
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,028
Who is it?

177
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,290
It must be a mistake.

178
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,923
Felicity!
Who killed Sara?

179
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,559
You did.

180
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,525
This must be a mistake.

181
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,728
I took perspiration
off the arrows that killed Sara.

182
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,563
Two years ago when the police
arrested Oliver

183
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,732
because they thought,
accurately, that he was the vigilante,

184
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,167
they took a DNA sample.

185
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:01,145
That sample is a match for 12
out of the 13 STRs.

186
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:02,588
The odds of that...

187
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,864
They're impossible.

188
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:06,064
Ok, so somehow
my DNA is on the arrows.

189
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,332
Someone's setting you up,
Oliver.

190
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:09,134
Well, somebody with
a vested interest

191
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,802
in pitting me against
the League of Assassins.

192
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,137
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

193
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:15,007
Merlyn was in Corto Maltese
with Thea when this was going down.

194
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:18,210
Unless he wasn't. I mean, Merlyn hid
successfully for two years

195
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:20,279
from the police and the League.

196
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,747
He's good
at covering his tracks.

197
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,182
So we uncover them.

198
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:26,118
But it might
take some time.

199
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,620
In less than 48 hours, the League
is going to murder 50 people.

200
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:31,190
We don't have time.

201
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:45,341
Move to the lab.
I'll deal with

202
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,409
the rest
of security.

203
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:49,578
Stay on comms.

204
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,380
Maseo, are you set?

205
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,649
Just about.

206
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:04,159
Found Omega.

207
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:06,362
Be careful with it.

208
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,731
Yeah, we might
have a problem.

209
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,165
What's wrong?

210
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,382
Somebody already
took it.

211
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:13,896
How did she get
in here before us?

212
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:22,978
She didn't need
to get in, Oliver.

213
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,681
She already
had someone inside.

214
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,584
Yeah, I know,
but it's the holidays

215
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,219
and I guess
I'm feeling charitable.

216
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:32,121
Is that ok?

217
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:34,356
Jake, I got
to call you right back.

218
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,130
Hey.

219
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:36,255
Hi!

220
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,862
Look who it is.

221
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:40,029
[Laughs]

222
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,397
How was your ride down?

223
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,765
Oh, uneventful.

224
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,367
Chance to grade
some papers.

225
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:46,602
Dad, maybe you can tell me
why half your officers

226
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,372
are allergic
to search warrants?

227
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:50,328
Mom!

228
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,861
Hi, sweetheart.

229
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,463
I didn't know that
you were coming to town.

230
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,198
Well, I guess
that's my fault,

231
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
'cause I thought you could
do a little Christmas surprise.

232
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:58,901
Hmm.

233
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,671
Of course I want to spend
Christmas with my family.

234
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:02,972
So where's Sara?

235
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:05,141
She's not returning
my phone calls.

236
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,443
Uh, yeah, that's 'cause
she's, uh, she's traveling.

237
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:12,148
Backpacking through the Andes.

238
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,450
- I think.
- Yeah.

239
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,721
I found something!

240
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:21,024
A.R.G.U.S. monitors air traffic
in and out of countries of interest.

241
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,459
Corto Maltese is on that list.

242
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,894
This is a list of every
commercial airliner,

243
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,963
private jet, sea plane,
and, I'm not kidding,

244
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:29,499
hot air balloon that took off
from Corto Maltese this past year.

245
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:30,967
Look at this flight path.

246
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,703
Private charter
from Corto Maltese to Caracas,

247
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,472
then to Cartagena,

248
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:37,740
only to fly back to Caracas,
and then to Tijuana.

249
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:40,777
Whoever was on that plane was working
pretty hard to hide where it was going.

250
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,345
The route ends
at a private landing strip

251
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,314
just outside
Starling City.

252
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:45,515
When did it
land?

253
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:48,151
The night before
Sara was murdered.

254
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,857
Please! All I do
is fly the plane!

255
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:55,358
Quiet!

256
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,526
The man in this photo--

257
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,795
did you fly him
from Corto Maltese

258
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:01,197
- to Starling City?
- No.

259
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,836
This time,
look at the photo!

260
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,771
He'll kill me.

261
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:11,508
He's not here. We are.

262
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,510
All right, ok, yes,
I flew him here.

263
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:16,212
I've got security footage,
you want to see?

264
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,881
Hanukkah present?

265
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:20,583
Security footage from the airfield
where Merlyn landed.

266
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:23,419
Check
for October seventh.

267
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:25,588
[Beep]

268
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:29,182
Right there,
stop.

269
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,077
I thought you said Merlyn was keeping
his distance from Thea,

270
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,213
that he hadn't had
any contact.

271
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,848
He lied.

272
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,452
And so did she.

273
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,386
Maybe there's something
we should consider here.

274
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,388
Maybe it wasn't your DNA, Oliver,
maybe it was Thea's.

275
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,457
What?
You two are siblings.

276
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,492
There would be overlap, maybe
even enough to--

277
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:14,494
Diggle, are you
listening to yourself?

278
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:16,830
You're suggesting that
Thea killed Sara.

279
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,531
Even if--even if she would,

280
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,166
even if she could...

281
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,694
Why?

282
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,560
Well, Malcolm Merlyn
is her father.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I hate to even say this.

284
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,853
Then don't.

285
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:30,421
Oliver...

286
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:31,989
I know how much
you love your sister,

287
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,258
but we have to look
at the facts.

288
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,093
The virtual autopsy
I did on Sara;

289
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,528
I thought Roy might
have stabbed her

290
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,497
because the trajectory
wasn't consistent

291
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,566
with that of an archer
of average height.

292
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:43,534
You weren't considering
a killer of Thea's size.

293
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:45,336
Enough, both of you!

294
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:48,172
My sister
did not kill Sara.

295
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,507
The DNA on
the arrows is mine

296
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,843
because Malcolm Merlyn
put it there.

297
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,146
[Cell phone vibrates]

298
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,782
[Sighs]

299
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:59,183
Hi.

300
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:00,585
Ray: Hey, uh,
we need to talk,

301
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,020
so I came here.
Here where?

302
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,689
Where you are.

303
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:08,125
I might have pinged
your phone...again.

304
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,696
I thought I was pretty clear when I
said I didn't want to talk about this.

305
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:13,998
You were.

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,133
But you were
also pretty wrong

307
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,036
when you said
I regretted kissing you.

308
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:21,839
I can't imagine
there's a man on the planet

309
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,575
who would ever
regret kissing you.

310
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,377
Well, I can think of one.

311
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,181
But I am sorry about
the way I reacted.

312
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:35,252
When I kissed you,
I felt guilty.

313
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,221
Oh, my God,
you're cheating on someone.

314
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,824
No.

315
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,026
Her name is Anna,

316
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:44,862
and we were engaged.

317
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,932
Last spring,
the night those men...

318
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,700
took over the city,

319
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,170
we ran into a few.
We tried to escape, but we couldn't.

320
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:55,206
I tried to fight them,
but I couldn't.

321
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,109
I wasn't strong
enough. I...

322
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:00,845
They broke my leg,

323
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,214
and went after her,

324
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:06,017
but I couldn't

It's a surprise.

488
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:23,098
on yourself,
but this is not your fault.

489
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,768
She's right, Oliver.
Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's,

490
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,836
let the League
sort this out.

491
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:29,638
Merlyn has a video.

492
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,141
He made contingencies.

493
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:33,909
Oliver, if you
fight Ra's al Ghul,

494
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:35,077
he'll kill you.

495
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,579
No, he won't.

496
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,315
During the Undertaking,
Merlyn told me

497
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:40,983
that I couldn't win,

498
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,952
because I didn't know
what I was fighting for.

499
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:46,689
Now I do.

500
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:49,425
I'm fighting for Thea.

501
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:56,932
He should have
confessed by now.

502
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,868
We have video evidence of him
taking the vials.

503
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,403
He says he doesn't remember.

504
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:03,339
He's lying! You don't
do something like that

505
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:05,574
- and not remember it!
- There is a way.

506
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:08,344
I didn't think it
a possibility until now.

507
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:11,513
There's a drug.
It's called Votura.

508
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:15,384
I've heard it makes people extremely
susceptible to suggestion.

509
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:18,153
Like mind control?

510
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:21,023
Really,
that's a thing?

511
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:22,658
Those who get dosed
often have no memory

of what they do
while under the influence.

513

Oh, great. All this
was for nothing?

514
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:29,298
Chien Na Wei
has the vial,

515
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,767
and we have no way
of finding her!

516
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,536
We've taken her inside man.

517
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:37,206
Finding her may not be
the problem at hand.

518
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,008
The problem could be
her finding us.

You really think
my father,

the Demon's head, would travel
all the way from Nanda Parbat

you failed to protect
the city you love.

Now you'll watch it bleed.

Well.

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,821
There was only one way
to prevent that.

546
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:37,789
You were to produce
for me the one

547
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,692
who killed
Ta-er Al-Sahfer.

00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,462
And yet
you've come alone.

549
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:46,431
Because it was me.

550
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,211
I killed Sara.

551
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,679
Why would you kill a woman
you once professed to love?

552
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:54,714
Because she
begged me to.

553
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,683
You lie.

554
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:04,880
It wasn't the first time Sara chose
death over a life in the League.

00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:07,281
And meeting you now,

I can see why.

557
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:13,955
I should have Sarab cleave
your head from your shoulders.

Not for killing
my daughter's beloved,

as Ta-er Al-Sahfer.

Why did you buy it?

652
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,557
Because it was
for sale.

My life is a little more
complicated than I let on.

654
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:22,497
Suffice it to say, I have gotten
very good at keeping secrets,

655
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:25,666

someone like you keeps.

Wasn't easy for me to tell you
about Anna.

658
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:32,940
You told me about Anna,
but you didn't tell me the truth

659
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:34,709
about what it is you're doing.

660
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:36,778

661

663
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:48,089
The dawn
of the computer age,

664
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:50,324
developers thought
the only way a machine

665
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,360
could process information
as fast as a human brain

666
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,896
was to build a mainframe
the size of Texas.

667
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:57,331
But one developer
realized that the only way

668
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,033
to reduce heat
and power consumption

669
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,335
was to bring the components
closer together.

670
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:03,704
Which meant
making them smaller.

671
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,573
But why stop
at computers?

672
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,809
What if it could
take other things,

673
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,777
like, say, all of
the military-grade technology

674
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:11,212
in Applied Sciences,

675
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:14,115
and make it smaller,
too? So small

676
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,551
that it can fit in
the palm of my hand.

677
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:19,287
I can help a lot
of people that way.

who you are anymore.

that Ra's al Ghul

if I'm a killer anymore.

00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,044
But I do know two things--

728
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,546
the first is that...

729
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:36,015
whoever I am,

730
00:36:36,017 --> 00:36:40,086
I am someone that will

it takes to save my sister.

732

And the second thing?

00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,726
I love you.

734
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:40,342
Remove your shirt.

735
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:43,545
This is custom.

736
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:46,381
Ra's al Ghul is not known
to be merciful.

737
00:37:46,383 --> 00:37:48,183
But if there was a chance,

738
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:51,987
this will be your final
moment for it.

739

Choose your weapon.

740
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:10,358
Ra's al Ghul: I was 11 years old
when I killed my first man.

741
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:16,131
I remember the look
in his face

742
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,934
when the light went out
behind his eyes.

743
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:22,170
Such a sudden change,

744
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:25,107
almost imperceptible,

745
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:28,110
between life and death.

746
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:29,644
And I felt ashamed.

747
00:38:29,646 --> 00:38:31,346
I had stolen
from that man

748
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:33,014

gift of all--

something else--

751
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:41,156
pride,

752
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,158
because I had taken up arms
against someone

753

who sought to do ill
against my family.

done was necessary.
