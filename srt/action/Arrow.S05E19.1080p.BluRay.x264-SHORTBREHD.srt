1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,799
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,339
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,093
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,432
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,856
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,101
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,855
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,027
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,696
Zoe's in a foster home.
A good one, it looks like.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,779
She shouldn't be anywhere near me.

12
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,289
I don't agree with that. I have
a lawyer friend who doesn't, either.

13
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,448
I'm worried about you.

14
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,616
Because you're into something,

15
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,041
and you don't want to
tell anyone about it.

16
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,332
You just have to trust me on this one.

17
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,541
If we can produce video
that Chase is Prometheus,

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,791
that's game over for him.

19
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>That is what we needed.</i>

20
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,002
Please let me be the one
to walk this into SCPD.

21
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,463
I'm gonna throw it up on YouTube.

22
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,552
<i>There won't be anywhere
that son of a bitch can run.</i>

23
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,073
Delta Team in position.

24
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,409
Seems our friends are here, too.

25
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,702
We're on site.

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,086
An A.R.G.U.S. drone confirms Adrian Chase
walked into the arcade at 0900.

27
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,830
<i>Sixteen hours ago.
That's a lifetime for Chase.</i>

28
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,091
Yeah, but no one has entered
or exited since.

29
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,504
We got the bastard.

30
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,099
We have to move right now.

31
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,270
See something?

32
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,397
Yes. This is Maximum Force. It's vintage.

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,607
We cannot let anything happen to this.

34
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,859
I'm more worried about
something happening to me.

35
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,569
Will you two focus?

36
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,742
Incoming!

37
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,894
Is everybody okay?

38
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,390
It was vintage.

39
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,535
Looks like we found our guy.

40
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,126
Chase escaped the arcade by using
a secret tunnel that led to Port Newark.

41
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,129
Homeland Security's placed him
on a no-fly list.

42
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,432
No, he's not gonna leave the country.
He isn't done yet.

43
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,392
How do you know?

44
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,604
Call it a hunch.

45
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,901
"A hunch"? Mayor Queen,
this city deserves better than a hunch.

46
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,437
Excuse the interruption.

47
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,281
I can't hold them off any longer.

48
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,791
All right, I will take a few questions.
Yes?

49
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,419
You worked side-by-side
with Adrian Chase for months.

50
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,839
How could you not know that you had
a serial killer in your administration?

51
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,803
Well, Mr. Chase's secret life
came as a surprise to us all.

52
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,676
I can say that we are currently
following up some very promising leads.

53
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,425
Are you saying
you have no idea where he is?

54
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,604
No, I'm saying that the details of
an ongoing investigation are confidential.

55
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,106
Yes?

56
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,150
<i>I spent the afternoon
speaking with Gay Eked's father.</i>

57
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,352
What do you have to say to him

58
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,525
and the families
of all of Prometheus' victims?

59
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,986
Well, I would say to them
what I'm saying to you.

60
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,698
We are doing everything
that we possibly can

61
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,445
to bring Mr. Chase to justice.

62
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,872
Do you have anything for us
other than canned platitudes?

63
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,336
Better question is, do we have anything?

64
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,997
Manhunts aren't exactly
in Helix's wheelhouse, Felicity.

65
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,502
Yeah, you helped me unmask Chase.

66
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,550
Now I need your help
trying to find the bastard.

67
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,793
Well, from what you've told me,

68
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,972
they've got Homeland Security,
the FBI, and A.R.G.U.S. working on this.

69
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,345
Yeah, and last night,
Chase played them like Maximum Force.

70
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,508
I used to love that game.

71
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,177
I know, I did, too.
Apparently, it's seen better days.

72
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,354
Point being, I was expecting you and Helix
to come up with a fresh perspective.

73
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,853
Maybe pull out some new trick,
something Chase isn't gonna anticipate.

74
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,360
Well, it would help not having to
waste time reinventing the wheel.

75
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,195
You wanna know what intel
they're working with?

76
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,523
Getting into Homeland Security
and the FBI is easy.

77
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,859
Their cyber sec is a bad joke.

78
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,910
But breaking into A.R.G.U.S.' network...

79
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,695
Allow me.

80
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,372
The intel of Chase being in New Jersey
came from an A.R.G.U.S. drone.

81
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,752
Okay. So?

82
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,753
So, the information was then sent
to an unsecured phone.

83
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,347
Seems like a big-time breach
in operational security.

84
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,094
- Wait.
- "Wait," what?

85
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,560
What if Chase has a buddy
inside A.R.G.U.S.?

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,559
Someone who tipped him off,
who pinged the unsecured cell phone?

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,101
Yeah.

88
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,443
- Mr. Mayor.
- Hi.

89
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,566
Could you give us some space?

90
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,611
Let's go.

91
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,405
Chase probably knew Agent Pierce
was part of our operation in Jersey.

92
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,785
This could be payback.

93
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,291
Okay, Lyla, what killed him?

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,952
Cause of death
looks like blunt force trauma.

95
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,796
Felicity, Curtis, we have a camera.

96
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,423
Roger, Roger. We have clearance, Clarence.

97
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,802
What is our vector, Victor?

98
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,259
Guys, focus, please.

99
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,312
That's evidence.

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,687
A.R.G.U.S. evidence.

101
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,483
All right, I got the video.
Streaming back to your phone now.

102
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,023
<i>- Here we go.
- You guys seeing this?</i>

103
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,943
Well, we're seeing it.
It looks like a meta.

104
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,278
An invisible meta?

105
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,622
Or psychokinesis.
Though, some prefer telekinesis.

106
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,699
I don't think so.
Check out what the elevator's doing.

107
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,871
Yeah, guys, Curtis is right.

108
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,620
According to the elevator activity logs,
the car accelerated upwards at...

109
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,171
Oh, my God, nine Gs.

110
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,674
And then it just dropped into a free fall
for 40 stories.

111
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,000
Death by elevator.

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,002
This doesn't feel like Chase.

113
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,509
No. At first, I thought Chase was
trying to tie up loose ends,

114
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,048
but I couldn't find
any connections between them.

115
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,175
He had his A.R.G.U.S.
security key still on him.

116
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,015
Why enter the elevator if not to take it?

117
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,061
Maybe to confirm the kill.

118
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,685
Guys, how do we manipulate
an elevator like that?

119
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,317
Remotely. I mean,
everything's computer-controlled.

120
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,067
All right. However this happened,
let's just find whoever did it.

121
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,532
We are on it.

122
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,652
Huh. Looks like the elevator
was hacked in real time.

123
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,861
Pulling up the rootkit now.

124
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,116
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,496
"Oh, my God," what?

126
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,211
Nothing. There's a line of code here
I'm not quite getting.

127
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,213
But I think I know someone at Helix
who can help.

128
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,459
Hey, don't you need to show them the code?

129
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,179
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Yes, thank you. Very helpful, Curtis.

130
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:53,148
I'm sorry, Mr. Eked, but the specifics
of the investigation into Adrian Chase,

131
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,066
they're just not open to the public.

132
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,235
The mother of my children is dead,
and you can't tell me anything?

133
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,068
I can assure you that the SCPD
and the Mayor's office

134
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,570
are doing everything in their power
to apprehend him.

135
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,033
We're gonna catch that scumbag.

136
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,367
Oh. Instead of working
shoulder-to-shoulder with him? Huh?

137
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,168
Sorry. It's just...

138
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,923
Things may not have worked out
between Gay and me,

139
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,096
but she was always there for the kids.

140
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,429
She loved them and they loved her.

141
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,601
And now she's gone.

142
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,448
Please find him.

143
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,458
<i>Gay didn't deserve dying like that.</i>

144
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,584
And no other family deserves this pain.

145
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,924
We will find him.

146
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,628
And he'll know
the true meaning of justice.

147
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,393
Thank you.

148
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,813
How many other victims' relatives
do we have today?

149
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,811
He was the last.

150
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,939
God, I don't think I could handle another.

151
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,949
These people are grieving, Rene.

152
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,445
I'm not saying they're not
entitled to their grief, hoss.

153
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,656
I'm saying hearing about it
all day long's a real buzzkill.

154
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,659
You know, I'd have thought
someone in your situation

155
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,453
would've been a little more...
Sympathetic?

156
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,834
- My situation?
- Yeah.

157
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:45,260
Curtis might've told me about your wife
and your daughter.

158
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,009
Curtis talks too much.

159
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,514
I don't disagree.

160
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,018
But while he was talking,

161
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,106
he also mentioned that he offered
to set you up with a lawyer

162
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,649
to help get your daughter back.

163
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,027
And that was over two months ago.

164
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,365
I'm just not ready, hoss.

165
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,707
A polymorphous worm
concealed by a kernel rootkit.

166
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,991
Are you trying to talk dirty to me?

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,168
I have the code, Alena. I know your work.

168
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,121
You hacked that elevator,
you killed that A.R.G.U.S. agent...

169
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,047
- Just slow down.
- Yes or no?

170
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,503
- Kind of.
- "Kind of"?

171
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,835
I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.

172
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,175
I'd never knocked anyone out
with an elevator before,

173
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,006
- and apparently, there's a learning curve.
- Alena.

174
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,841
I need you to hear me out for one second.

175
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,722
You murdered someone.

176
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,970
Accidentally, and for a good cause.

177
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,395
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

178
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,060
Cayden James.

179
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,400
He's the most skilled hacker
the world has ever known.

180
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,856
If he was, I would've heard of him.

181
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,403
No, you wouldn't have,
because he's just that good.

182
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,862
He's a ghost.

183
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,907
He's also the person that formed Helix.

184
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,071
What does that have to do with...

185
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,818
Eight months ago,
he was scooped up by A.R.G.U.S.

186
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,903
Not arrested, not charged, just taken.

187
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,166
And now he's being held without cause.
Being tortured, who knows what else.

188
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,744
And I had to take this off
that A.R.G.U.S. agent so we can free him.

189
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,918
Alena, you killed someone.

190
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,004
Before you get too judgmental,

191
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,924
know you're gonna help me free Cayden
from where A.R.G.U.S. is holding him.

192
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,092
Why would I do that?

193
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,181
Because before he was taken,
Cayden was working on a biometric tracker

194
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,599
that could recognize a heartbeat.

195
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,886
Powerful enough to scan
anywhere in the world.

196
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,854
Anywhere Adrian Chase is.

197
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,100
<i>We have</i> a <i>problem.</i>

198
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,936
- What is it?
- The problem.

199
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,901
After Damien Darhk
took my security implant last year,

200
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,405
I instituted new protocols to prevent
any sensitive A.R.G.U.S. information,

201
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,032
or location
from being accessed by a single person.

202
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,534
Access now requires
two of these security keys.

203
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,458
But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken.
You found it on him.

204
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,036
- I found a very sophisticated copy.
- Smart.

205
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,791
Extremely. I almost didn't catch it.

206
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,920
If those keys have been compromised,
then they have to be reprogrammed.

207
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,627
The whole point of having the keys
is for them to be unhackable.

208
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,758
Reprogramming takes about 24 hours.

209
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,341
Lyla, clearly,
A.R.G.U.S. security is under attack.

210
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,557
But this doesn't feel like Chase.

211
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,685
And, quite frankly,
that is where we have to keep our focus.

212
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,186
And I sympathize.

213
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,440
But I've got almost all personnel
with keys in lockdown at A.R.G.U.S.

214
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,942
- "Almost"?
- Agent Ditkoff is 20 miles out,

215
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,363
near Port Talbert.

216
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,908
I was hoping your team
could escort her back to A.R.G.U.S.

217
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,824
Oliver, I know you wanna get Chase.
So do I.

218
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,622
But A.R.G.U.S. has always had our backs.

219
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,039
Yes, they have.

220
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,914
Let's call Curtis and Dinah.

221
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,835
Please let Felicity know
where we're going.

222
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,037
Copy that.

223
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,498
Just let me talk
to my friends at A.R.G.U.S.

224
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,925
Maybe we can negotiate
for Cayden's release.

225
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,965
Sorry. It's just funny, you know?

226
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,212
"Negotiate with A.R.G.U.S."

227
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,139
Seriously, I really think they will.
Just hold off on taking the second key.

228
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,513
A.R.G.U.S. won't even admit
they have Cayden.

229
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,264
Besides, plan's already in motion.

230
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,553
What did you do?

231
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,814
Don't worry.
I hired professionals this time.

232
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,106
"Professionals"?

233
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,934
One casualty was enough
for this girl's conscience.

234
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,109
Like mercenaries?

235
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,778
You really can buy anything
on the Internet.

236
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,695
Well, are your Internet thugs
headed to Port Talbert?

237
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,444
Because they're about to
have some company.

238
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,177
Over Terrific here. Or Mr. Watch.
Or Watch Terrific.

239
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,378
Anyway, it'll come to me.

240
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,553
We're on our way.

241
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,758
Right. Seven-hundred feet ahead,
three bogies. Please hurry.

242
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,611
Dinah and I
are a <i>few blocks</i> away.

243
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,979
Hey, John,
I know you have to protect that agent.

244
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,147
We're on our way.

245
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,315
I know you have to protect her,

246
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,483
but I need you to let those guys
get away with her security key.

247
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,027
Wait, what? What?

248
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,240
Hey! Don't move!

249
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,279
Oliver, we have a situation.

250
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,660
I need you to let tango
get away with that security key.

251
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,161
<i>- Why?
- Felicity has information</i>

252
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,040
<i>that we don't have.
Oliver, I need you to stand down.</i>

253
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,257
What the hell was that?

254
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,596
Felicity said we had to.

255
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,798
<i>Why'?</i>

256
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,224
To catch Prometheus.

257
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,641
It's the only way to catch Chase.

258
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,101
No, it's not.

259
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,691
But even if it were, at what cost?

260
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,280
Agent Ditkoff could've been killed.

261
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,447
No, the team was there to make sure.

262
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,242
She could've been killed,
just like Agent Pierce.

263
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,443
I told you, that was an accident.

264
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,280
And now, two keys are in the wind,
and A.R.G.U.S. is vulnerable.

265
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,455
What the hell were you thinking?

266
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,330
That we need to catch
this son of a bitch, no matter what.

267
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,000
Guys, a little support here.

268
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,545
Might be crossing a line, Felicity.

269
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,344
Well, you're the last person on Earth
that gets to give that lecture, Oliver.

270
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,971
Or second to last.

271
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,092
And don't tell me that you don't make
morally questionable choices

272
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,018
so that I don't have to. I have to.

273
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,562
No, you don't, Felicity,
you don't have to.

274
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,265
Lyla's right. There are better ways
for us to find Chase.

275
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,316
Chase has been in the wind for a week.

276
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,399
He was trained by Talia al Ghul.
He knows how to stay in the wind.

277
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,695
What other leads do we have?

278
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,365
How else are we gonna
bring Adrian Chase to justice,

279
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,614
unless A.R.G.U.S. lets go of Cayden James?

280
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,412
- Not a chance.
- Then my only choice is to help Helix.

281
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,368
Your only choice?

282
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,574
Felicity, I thought
we're on the same side.

283
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,705
No, John, I'm on the side
that's gonna put Chase away,

284
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,206
so that he can't hurt anyone ever again.

285
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,458
<i>Hey, Felicity.</i>

286
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,498
Let her go, man. Now is not the time.

287
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,849
You wanted to see me, hoss?

288
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,638
Yeah. First, close the door.

289
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,396
Second, what have I told you
about calling me "hoss"?

290
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,443
- Don%.
- Right.

291
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978
Yeah.

292
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,276
Just sit down.

293
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,620
Are you firing me?

294
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,038
Rene, there was a time when
I would've loved to hear you ask me that.

295
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,584
But no, lam not firing you.

296
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,586
I wanna talk to you about...

297
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,538
Zoe.

298
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,382
Yeah, your daughter.

299
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,210
Yeah, I know her name, hoss.

300
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,547
I thought I told you
I don't wanna talk about her.

301
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,007
Well, that's too bad,

302
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,805
'cause you happen to be working
for a guy who would give anything

303
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,477
to be with his daughter again.

304
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,640
What do you want from me, man?

305
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,974
An explanation.

306
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,519
<i>I looked into your case.</i>

307
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,609
You have full visitation rights

308
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,691
as long as you're accompanied
by a court-appointed guardian.

309
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,528
And there's no record
of you ever visiting.

310
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,911
Please...

311
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,160
Just leave this alone, man.

312
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,325
I think we both know I'm not gonna.

313
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,286
So why don't we just skip to the part
where you tell me

314
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,371
why you do not wanna see your daughter?

315
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,124
Okay.

316
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,004
When Curtis told me about
his lawyer friend, I got excited, okay?

317
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,385
Yeah, yeah, all right.
And then what happened?

318
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,510
I remembered why they took Zoe
away from me in the first place.

319
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,018
Yeah, sure, I could visit her

320
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,312
with a court-appointed guardian,
like you said.

321
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,517
You wanna know why that is?

322
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,402
'Cause I'm bad news.

323
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,856
- Yeah, you're an acquired taste, for sure.
- I hurt her!

324
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,450
What do you mean, you hurt her?

325
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,496
I was reheating some soup for her.

326
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,089
It's just about all I could make her.

327
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,009
And it was on the stove,
and I passed out drunk.

328
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,389
Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it,
and pulls it down,

329
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,475
and it burns her hand real bad.

330
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,653
And it was her crying that woke me up.

331
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,782
Zoe deserves better than me.

332
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,781
End of story.

333
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,909
Rene. Rene. Get back...

334
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,085
Meet prisoner 38085, aka Cayden James.

335
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,249
What are you holding him on?

336
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,926
He's a person of interest.

337
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,800
So, no crime,
I'm guessing no trial, either.

338
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,931
Do you have something
you wanna say to me, Johnnie?

339
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,134
Not right now, Lyla.

340
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,927
<i>There's something
we're not considering.</i>

341
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,062
What if Felicity is right?

342
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,397
She might be right.

343
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,567
We give James a terminal,
we make him find Chase,

344
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,237
and then we hand him back to Helix.

345
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,902
I know you want Chase
off the board, Oliver,

346
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,784
but Cayden James
is as dangerous as a loose nuke.

347
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,486
I can't put him back in play.

348
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,822
Helix has compromised your security.

349
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,957
And now they have hired mercenaries
that are gonna go after A.R.G.U.S.

350
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
to get James out.

351
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,661
Which means we go after them first.

352
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,788
Curtis has intel as to where
their base of operations is.

353
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,794
And we'd be going in completely blind.

354
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,172
We have a greater chance of success
if we let Helix come to us.

355
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,588
Wait, Lyla.

356
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,679
You wanna set a trap for Helix
and use James as the bait?

357
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,436
I don't think I need to tell either of you
how dangerous Helix is.

358
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,264
This is our chance to take them down.

359
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,108
This is happening
with or without your help.

360
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,946
I'll let you boys
wrap your head around that.

361
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,784
We have to get Felicity out of Helix.

362
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,114
We can't let her get involved in this.

363
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,666
You mean any more involved.

364
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,618
We knew she was into something.

365
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,496
We knew it was bad.

366
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,298
We just let her get in deeper.

367
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,177
Oliver, grief can make people
do crazy things.

368
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,004
No one knows that better than you and me.

369
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,720
But I'm not the one she was gonna marry.

370
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,056
What's your point?

371
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,398
My point is...

372
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,062
Oliver, look. Maybe we should've
talked her out of Helix.

373
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,324
Maybe not. I don't know.
But the point is, we're here now.

374
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,367
And you're the only one
she will listen to.

375
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,743
I'm not sure how much credibility
I have with her.

376
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,337
You both wanna catch Chase, right?
You have that in common.

377
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,717
Which tells me you are the only one
who can pull her back from the brink.

378
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
Oh.

379
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,344
- Hi.
- Hey.

380
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,558
Nice of you to use
the front door for once.

381
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,061
May I come in, please?

382
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,516
Actually, I was just leaving.

383
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,851
I can see that.

384
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,855
Sure.

385
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,196
Looks like you're not sitting
behind a keyboard for this one.

386
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,207
- Can you blame me?
- No.

387
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,545
I, more than probably anyone else,
understand what it's like

388
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,923
to be willing to do whatever it takes
to stop Chase.

389
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,208
Then let me do it.

390
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,089
Let me just tell you
how I'm seeing things.

391
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,804
You're willing to do whatever it takes
to stop Chase

392
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:42,093
because I was willing to do
whatever it takes to save this city...

393
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,263
And that created him.

394
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,394
Okay, so it's ironic. That's what it is.

395
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,724
It doesn't have to be.

396
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,985
You see, we can think of
another way to find him,

397
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,572
and then we can find
another way to stop him.

398
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,732
Okay, how? The SCPD tip line?

399
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,070
No, that's not gonna work this time,
Oliver. We both know that.

400
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,621
Look, this is our only chance.

401
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,952
And this is me asking you.

402
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,453
Don't do this.

403
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,757
For the past four years, I have
watched you do whatever you had to,

404
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,586
whatever it took,
to stop the people threatening this city.

405
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,138
How can you stand there
and not ask me to do the same thing?

406
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,263
Because over the past four years,
you, more than anyone else,

407
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,766
has seen the toll that it has taken on me.

408
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,102
- And I told you...
- And I understand, I agree

409
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,525
that I should not shelter you
from making hard decisions.

410
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,610
But you wanna talk irony? Fine.

411
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,610
You are willing to sell your soul

412
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,494
to destroy a threat that I created.

413
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,656
How did...

414
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,665
One of the reasons I fell in love with you

415
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,668
is because you're always willing
to do what was right,

416
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,961
no matter what the cost.

417
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,127
Even if it's unbearably hard.

418
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,510
It's what makes you, you.

419
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,018
So how can I be any different?

420
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:14,565
You have sacrificed your soul
for the team, for the city, and for me.

421
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,071
You don't have to
carry that burden any longer.

422
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,487
Let me do it.

423
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:28,915
Felicity, l...

424
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,005
I can't.

425
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,505
Then you'll have to stop me.

426
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,722
This facility has eight ingress points.

427
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,229
I've got six-man teams stationed at each,

428
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,190
perimeter squads keeping watch,
and drones flying surveillance.

429
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,896
Helix has to be ready for all of that.

430
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,530
That's why we're here.
Added support and the element of surprise.

431
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,366
You think Felicity will be surprised
that we're trying to stop her?

432
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,870
Actually, I am kind of surprised.
I mean, you and her have a history.

433
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,576
Just kind of like,
"We're against each other."

434
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,536
Let's have you and Dinah
patrol the southwest.

435
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,749
Stay on comms, okay?

436
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,289
- Quick question.
- Mmm-hmm.

437
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,461
What do we do if she shows up tonight?

438
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,587
We stop her.

439
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:34,232
Logistics calculates a 46% likelihood
they'll try to breach through here.

440
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,275
Okay. Then we'll be ready for them.

441
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,317
We're not expecting Helix
for another seven minutes,

442
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,780
so would you like to use that time

443
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,576
to tell me what I've done
that's got you so pissed off?

444
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,573
Lyla, I'm not pissed off.

445
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,117
But I am concerned.

446
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,579
What did Felicity mean
when she made that crack

447
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,917
about you crossing a line?

448
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,421
I can't even begin to fathom
the amount of crap

449
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,673
that Helix has put
into Felicity's head, Johnnie.

450
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,756
But Lyla,
holding Cayden James without due process,

451
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,349
that's not a bunch of crap.

452
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,469
Cayden James is 20 times
more dangerous than Snowden.

453
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,771
We caught him trying to hack
an A.R.G.U.S. transponder.

454
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,432
If he got in, every NOC agent we have
could be at risk.

455
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,813
That sounds a whole lot
like Amanda Waller.

456
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,864
Waller's decisions seem a lot less wrong
from this side of the desk, Johnnie.

457
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,319
You can't judge me for that.

458
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,946
I'm not judging.

459
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm just worried.

460
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,792
Felicity Smoak is one of
the best people I've ever known,

461
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,624
and she's gone over to the dark side.

462
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,049
I don't want that to happen to my wife.

463
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,979
I've done a lot of illegal things,

464
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,140
but none of them
ever required heavy weaponry.

465
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,309
Or any weaponry.

466
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,480
You know, I found the transition
between hacker to vigilante

467
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,155
to be surprisingly straightforward.

468
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,028
You're gonna do great.

469
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,075
Besides, you have enough
firepower here to invade Russia.

470
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,695
Well, hopefully, we won't have to.

471
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,155
I think we might.

472
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,244
They know we're coming.

473
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,158
I'm not worried.

474
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,084
In case you need them.

475
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,874
No.

476
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,669
I mean, even if we do, I'm not using that.

477
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:23,840
A.R.G.U.S. will have guns.

478
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,384
I thought you said
no one was gonna get hurt.

479
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,386
If we do this right, no one will.

480
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,427
Wait for my signal.

481
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,020
What's so important, hoss?
I was gonna call it a night.

482
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,353
Daddy!

483
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,188
Sweetheart.

484
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,031
I told you.

485
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,906
Hey, you're not the only one around here
that doesn't listen to orders.

486
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,954
Who's he?

487
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,206
This is Quentin, Quentin Lance,
Daddy's friend.

488
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,956
But I call him "hoss."

489
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,131
He arranged this little visit.

490
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,958
Thank you, hoss.

491
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,966
- I missed you.
- I missed you so much.

492
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,431
I missed you more.

493
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,223
Dang, girl, you're getting so big.
Look at you.

494
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,396
Pretty soon you're gonna be
driving Pops to the games.

495
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,898
Isn't that right?

496
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,267
Tell your daddy what you're doing
at school now, Zoe.

497
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:25,940
I made the hockey team.

498
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,947
What? No way. What position you playing?

499
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,276
- Goalie.
- That's my girl.

500
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,069
Just like your pops.

501
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,486
Oh...

502
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,450
That's so good. I'm proud of you.

503
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,791
Can we go home now?

504
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,593
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but not today.

505
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,633
<i>Why'?</i>

506
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,435
Sweetheart, last time you were with me,
you got hurt, baby.

507
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,012
It was an accident.

508
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,681
When can I go home to Daddy?

509
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,482
I don't know, sweetheart.

510
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,987
<i>Soon, peanut.</i>

511
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,821
There's a lawyer friend
Daddy's friend knows.

512
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,120
And Daddy's decided
he's gonna talk to him,

513
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,664
and you're gonna come home with me.

514
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,377
I promise. Okay? I promise.

515
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,723
I thought you were
standing post with Lyla.

516
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,218
Seemed like a good idea
to put some space between us.

517
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,188
Felicity isn't the only lady
who thinks the ends justifies the means.

518
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,312
When Lyla and Felicity Smoak
are willing to cross the line...

519
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,352
Makes you wonder
if there even is one, right?

520
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,145
We got incoming.

521
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,148
Tango's in the field.

522
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,523
Copy that.

523
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,532
What's that?

524
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,656
Think of it as a weaponized tablet,

525
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,412
preloaded with Address Resolution
Protocol Spoofing.

526
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,833
The A.R.G.U.S. site is protected
by microchipped gun turrets.

527
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,165
Right. This will shut them down?

528
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,551
You sure you're ready for this?

529
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:14,878
Let's do this.

530
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,344
Bogie's on site. Want us to intercept?

531
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,549
Negative. Draw them in closer.

532
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,750
Identification, please.

533
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,097
It's not them.

534
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,523
Lyla, sitrep.

535
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,102
The van checked out. It wasn't Helix.

536
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:13,854
We have a problem.

537
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,660
Wait, this isn't A.R.G.U.S.

538
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,119
No, it is. Just not the site
A.R.G.U.S. expected us to hit.

539
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:31,997
What problem?

540
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,957
Helix is about to extract Cayden James.

541
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,089
- How? They're not here.
- Neither is Cayden James.

542
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,340
And you didn't tell us?

543
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,296
I didn't think it was necessary.

544
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,964
Where is he?

545
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,468
At an off-the-books black site,
12 miles away.

546
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,108
<i>Damn it, Lyla, you should've
let us in on the plan.</i>

547
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,365
Helix wasn't supposed to know
about the black site. No one was.

548
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,741
<i>That's because it's illegal.</i>

549
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,413
I'm not discussing this, Johnnie.

550
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,166
Get your head in the game.
You're two minutes out.

551
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,848
<i>Where has this tablet
been all my life?</i>

552
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,928
I made it special for you.
So much better than a friendship bracelet.

553
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,434
How are we gonna find Cayden James?

554
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,019
I know he's inside
one of these containers,

555
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,274
but I don't know exactly which one.

556
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,604
Can you check to see
if there's a site map?

557
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,897
Mmm-hmm.

558
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,615
Okay.

559
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,034
<i>Whatever A.R.G.U.S. is keeping in there,
they wanna keep secure.</i>

560
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,786
Or whoever.

561
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,549
Two air-gapped, unhackable keys.
It's beautiful tech, really.

562
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,881
Free Cayden James now.
Admire A.R.G.U.S. tech later.

563
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,090
Right.

564
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,185
- One...
- Two...

565
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,390
Three.

566
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,942
Cayden?

567
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,330
Hey. Hey. It's okay, this is a rescue.

568
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,077
We gotta move.
Team Arrow will be here any minute.

569
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,326
I doubt that very much.
They have no clue we're here.

570
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,210
Do not say "I told you so."
Meet us out back in five.

571
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,457
Where are we going?

572
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,459
We're gonna go say hi to your friends.

573
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,995
Don't grab a woman
unless you have permission, dumbass.

574
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,918
Freeze!

575
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,501
I've got Felicity's friend.

576
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,632
I have a name, you know.

577
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,806
Turn around. Put your hands on your head.

578
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,638
- Do it!
- Okay. Turning.

579
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,328
You wanna see what else they can do?

580
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,952
Next one goes in his head.

581
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,838
Then it'll have to go through me. Go!

582
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,289
Get out of the way!

583
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,211
You know I can't do that.
I was really hoping you wouldn't!

584
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,008
Oliver, don't move.

585
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:12,351
That is a 30-kilowatt spectral beam laser.
It'll cut you to the bone.

586
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,434
Curtis will let you out.

587
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,353
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,784
I am. I'm really hoping that you're gonna
understand after we get Chase.

589
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,038
Don't count on it.

590
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,380
On the bright side, we were suited up.

591
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,303
I mean, I'm glad Cayden James
doesn't know that, you know,

592
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,680
we were trying to keep him in prison.

593
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,386
Because if he did, I would be scared

594
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,563
of my refrigerator, my car,
my alarm clock.

595
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,515
And could we talk
about elevators for a second?

596
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,193
Because I think I'm gonna be
taking the stairs for a while.

597
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,896
It's just better for your health.

598
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,529
Also, on the bright side, you know,
so, just think about that.

599
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,485
This wasn't a prison, Curtis.

600
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:15,414
This was an illegal black site
on American soil led by my wife.

601
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,791
Also, no A.R.G.U.S. casualty...

602
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,966
No A.R.G.U.S. casualties.
All the mercs used rubber bullets, so...

603
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,345
What do you wanna do about Felicity?

604
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,051
There is nothing to do.

605
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:38,516
She put herself in front of a bullet
in order to take down Chase.

606
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,598
Until that happens,
I don't know what to say to her.

607
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,354
In the meantime,
we drink to her speedy success. I mean...

608
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,896
In the meantime, I think we go home.

609
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,272
Why? There's more glasses in the bunk...

610
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,652
You wanna drink by your... Okay.
Yeah, right. I mean, yeah.

611
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,953
Thank you both very much for tonight.

612
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,970
Yep.

613
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,423
You're working late.

614
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,517
Well, I thought I'd stick around
for my thank you.

615
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,557
You had that coming, for sure.

616
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,645
Along with an apology.

617
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,770
Here I was, thinking you didn't know
what an apology was.

618
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,021
I guess you can
teach a dog some new tricks.

619
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,313
Even wild ones.

620
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,241
I spoke to Curtis' lawyer friend.

621
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,740
I put things in motion.

622
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,163
Good for you.

623
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,667
You know, that Zoe,
she's a hell of a little girl, and...

624
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,129
You know, she deserves her dad.

625
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,131
<i>You know, father to father,</i>

626
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,717
I gotta tell you,

627
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,342
her dad deserves to be with her.

628
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,306
Thank you.

629
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,393
That's what I was waiting for.

630
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,311
All right, how about
a celebratory club soda?

631
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,937
I'm buying.

632
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,978
Hey, hold on a second, hoss.
How about something stronger?

633
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,780
You keep calling me "hoss,"
I'll show you something stronger.

634
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,488
Hello?

635
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,492
<i>Hey, Felicity.</i>

636
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,753
Hi. Where are you? Are you okay?

637
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,671
<i>We're safe.
Thank you for all of your help.</i>

638
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,011
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

639
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:40,559
<i>Your connection to the Green Arrow
and his team, it's a liability.</i>

640
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,596
Yeah. Well, once we get Chase,
he'll see all the good Helix can do.

641
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,891
<i>I'm sorry, but we just can't risk it.</i>

642
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,606
<i>Especially not with
Cayden back in the fold</i>

643
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,902
<i>and A.R.G.U.S. looking for him.</i>

644
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,736
<i>I loved getting to work with you.</i>

645
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,157
<i>Meeting your heroes,
it turns out it's not so bad after all.</i>

646
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,366
<i>But we left something for you. Look down.</i>

647
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,327
<i>Up a little bit.</i>

648
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,205
<i>Little bit to the right.</i>

649
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,790
This?

650
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,876
What is it?

651
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,337
<i>Some on-the-fly coding from Mr. James.</i>

652
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,761
<i>Told you he was the best there ever was.</i>

653
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,761
<i>Take care, Felicity.</i>

654
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,394
Yeah, you, too.

655
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,914
Johnnie.

656
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,124
We need to talk about this.

657
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,463
I don't think that's a good idea, Lyla.

658
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,430
- I could say something I might regret.
- John.

659
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,929
When you said that you were
taking over for Waller,

660
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,764
you said you wouldn't become her.

661
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,141
I told you.

662
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,269
It's more complicated when you're sitting
on the other side of the...

663
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,474
What the hell is more complicated?

664
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,404
You're holding someone
with no lawyer, no trial, no justice.

665
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,321
And the world is safer for it.

666
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,158
It could be safer.

667
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,497
But it's not better.

668
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,750
The woman I love could never do this.
Lyla, this job has changed you.

669
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,967
Maybe.

670
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,133
But maybe the world's changed.

671
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,432
It's gotten even worse, Johnnie.

672
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,511
It's gotten worse and uglier,
and we do what we can

673
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,642
to protect the people we love.

674
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,150
Lam not ashamed of what I did.

675
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,862
Of what I'm still going to do.

676
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,696
We've been down this road before,
haven't we?

677
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,907
We know where this fight takes us.

678
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,080
So let's stop it.

679
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,583
Move forward.

680
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,887
I don't know if I can.

681
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,987
- Is that it?
- Yep.

682
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,118
James' magic tracker to find Chase?

683
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,871
Biometric tracker, yes.

684
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,370
Nobody from A.R.G.U.S.
was seriously injured,

685
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,871
in case you were wondering.

686
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,752
Helix froze me out.

687
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,542
It's over.

688
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,135
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,298
I thought you weren't ever
gonna lie to me again.

690
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,259
I'm not lying.

691
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,636
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,523
I know that they gave you
a sense of belonging

693
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,191
- that maybe I haven't...
- No.

694
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,524
You didn't back my play.

695
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,280
I was worried.

696
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,698
You don't trust me.

697
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,453
After all these years,
all of the times that I supported you,

698
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,908
even when I didn't agree,
you couldn't do the same for me.

699
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,001
What's that?

700
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,997
Tracker's honing in on Chase's location.

701
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,918
Where is he?

702
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,052
Chase. He's here.
