1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,010
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,846
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,520
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,929
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,408
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,285
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,806
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,291
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,807
Blood's trounced every
potential candidate we focus tested.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,724
You want me to run against Blood?

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,926
- Child of Ra's Al Ghul awaits your return.
- Tell Ra's Al Ghul my family's off limits.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,282
- It's time for you to come back home.
- I can't.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,687
If they knew I was alive, Laurel and Mom...

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,851
they would never stop looking for me
and that could get them both killed.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,522
Thea Queen telling me
enough is enough.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,881
Now, that is rich.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,886
Sara?

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,605
Welcome to Starling City
International Airport.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,771
Please have your passports ready
and your customs forms filled out.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,089
All passengers with departing flights
will need to show...

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,881
appropriate identification
and declaration papers.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,924
International passengers
are required to have a passport...

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,487
and an airline boarding pass to travel.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,489
Business or personal, Miss Raatko?

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,891
Personal.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,970
All passengers
are required to pick up their luggage...

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,566
in the baggage claim area...

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,170
My computer froze.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,362
Can you hold on a sec?
I'll be right back.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,566
Down on the ground!
Get your hands on your head!

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,001
I said hands on your head, lady.
I will shoot you!

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,561
Welcome to Starling City...

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,491
A successful mayoral campaign isn't about
polling, it isn't about fundraising...

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,411
or hot-button issues,
it's about connecting with people.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,510
That's why, right after we
announce tomorrow, Moira...

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,330
I want to get you in front of
as many cameras as possible.

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,490
- Morning shows, talk shows...
- Mark, I want to help rebuild the city...

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,929
- not pander to it.
- It's not pandering Mum, it's campaigning.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,048
Let the people get to know
the real Moira Queen...

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,323
- and they are gonna fall in love with you.
- Speaking from experience...

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,483
this man knows
what he's talking about, Moira.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,808
Mr. Steele, may I talk
to you about something?

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,328
I'm no longer your boss, Felicity.
So let's make it Walter from now on.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,161
Okay. Walter. It's about Tempest.

45
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,166
Mrs. Queen's super sketchy offshore LLC
you asked me to look into last year.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,646
I remember.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,121
That's right.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,688
So, the thing is, I left an
embedded account alert on it...

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,645
so we'd know
if anyone ever accessed it again.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,810
A few days ago there was a wire transfer
made from Tempest...

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,367
to a numbered account
at Starling National Bank.

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,126
Probably the campaign
accountants shutting it down.

53
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,169
Or it could be something else.

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,880
That is the money Ms. Queen used
to do really bad things.

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,845
I mean, you guys got divorced
for pretty good reasons...

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,207
which is not my business.

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,607
I'll talk to Moira first thing.

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,481
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,686
Of course.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,004
Well, we're starting a campaign.

61
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,248
- Oliver, can I have a word?
- Yes.

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,209
I know that you and he are friends...

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,131
but you'll need to end
your support for Sebastian Blood.

64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,322
- I will speak to Sebastian.
- Good.

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,244
Hello.

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,841
I'll be right there.

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,165
Oliver.

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,091
- Mrs. Lance.
- I came back as soon as I heard.

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,765
Thanks for coming.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,964
Hey. How are you feeling?

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,927
- I've been better.
- Don't worry, baby.

72
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,407
We're going to get you
all the help you need.

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,560
There's a great rehab outside of Starling.
And they've got a bed waiting...

74
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,211
Dad, I already told you, I didn't OD.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,324
I didn't take any pills last night.
I swear.

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,689
Laurel, the doctor wants to check your eye.

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,400
- What happened to her eye?
- Minor subconjunctival hemorrhaging.

78
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,800
Probably from hitting her head
when she lost consciousness.

79
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:06,145
After the exam, we can discharge her.

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,290
You feel better, okay?

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,251
Thank you.

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,442
We'll be outside. Let's go.

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,684
Dad...

84
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,448
What is it, sweetheart?

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,887
Before I passed out...

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,601
the strangest thing happened.

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,883
I saw Sara.
I know I was hallucinating...

88
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,607
but I saw her.
She was standing right over me.

89
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,127
I mean, I've dreamt
about her over the years...

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,886
but this was so much more real.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,764
That's crazy, right?

92
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,725
Yeah, it's crazy.

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,162
She's been doing that
for like an hour.

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,851
You saw Laurel? Is she going to be okay?

95
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,289
You saved her life.

96
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,241
Thanks for calling me.
And I never did ask you...

97
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,442
how did you find me?

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,483
I wasn't going to lose you again.

99
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,802
- I should get going.
- Hey, so that's it?

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,009
You're back in town for 24 hours and now
you're just going to take off again?

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,288
The League of Assassins
is still after me, Ollie...

102
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,125
and staying in town
would put my whole family at risk.

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,169
I only came back because
Laurel's in trouble.

104
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,523
She's still in trouble, Sara.
Your entire family needs you.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,684
And so do I.

106
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,608
Do me a favor? Dig up a copy of Laurel's
blood work from the hospital, please.

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,883
- Sure. What are we looking for?
- I just want to make sure of something.

108
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,045
It's for you.

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,406
- Hello, detective.
- Put my daughter on.

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,409
I know she's there.

111
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,487
Hilton, tell the lieutenant that
that the perp was

112
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,913
practically lawyering up when
I read him his Miranda.

113
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,470
If we don't get on top of this situation,
the lieutenant, he's not gonna...

114
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,725
- It smells amazing, Dad.
- Oh, yeah. Here, try one of these.

115
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,010
- Beautiful... No, I'm talking to Laurel.
- Quentin, hang up the phone...

116
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,440
...spend time with your family.

117
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:48,434
...time with my family. You heard that.
I gotta go. Bye buddy.

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,285
Sorry, ladies.
Our doer hired some dirtbag lawyer.

119
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,767
Says the dad whose daughter
just applied to law school.

120
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,270
That is not the kind of lawyer
that you're gonna be, young lady.

121
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,911
Because you, you're gonna
be a judge or you're

122
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,590
gonna be a professor
just like your mother.

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,365
Yeah, come over to academia.
The fun never ends.

124
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,324
Dinner is at a crucial point.

125
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,524
- Hiya!
- Hi!

126
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,411
- Hi there.
- Hi!

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,843
- Hi.
- Sara, what a surprise.

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,327
Please don't tell me you
got kicked out of college.

129
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,562
Oh, well, thank you for
the vote of confidence.

130
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,680
I had a three day weekend so I figured
I'd drive down, surprise everybody.

131
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,424
Well, you're just in time to eat.
Come here.

132
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,522
Get yourself another plate. Come on.

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,931
Here you go.

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,365
Hi, Dad.

135
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,843
I only have a minute.

136
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,691
One cup of tea is all I ask. Sit down.

137
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,968
I've missed you so much.

138
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,083
How's Laurel?

139
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,443
She saw you.
Right before she passed out.

140
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,371
She thought it was...
I don't know what, a hallucination.

141
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,801
- Good.
- No, baby, you don't understand.

142
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,644
Seeing you, it made her happy.

143
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,447
Dad, the League,
they're still hunting me.

144
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,910
So what, you're just gonna pop back
everytime one of us in trouble?

145
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,161
We can't live like this, Sara.
And you can't.

146
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,441
It's time we started
facing things together.

147
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,442
I've had better greetings.

148
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,770
I'm sorry, I just...
I didn't know what you were going to do.

149
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,610
To be honest, neither did I.

150
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,209
Yeah. We should talk.

151
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,890
Of course.

152
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,208
Do we need permission
from your boyfriend?

153
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,884
I am Nyssa.
Daughter of Ra's Al Ghul.

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,729
Heir to the Demon.

155
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,206
What are you doing here?

156
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,370
Sara swore her allegiance
to the League of Assassins.

157
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,049
It's time for her to return home.

158
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,683
That is not going to happen.

159
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,081
Nyssa, please,
would you give us a moment?

160
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,367
Take your time.
Goodbyes are never easy.

161
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,403
Is that why I didn't get one?

162
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,484
I can explain...

163
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,444
You don't have to.

164
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,406
But you're not leaving. I don't trust her.

165
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,250
Then trust me.

166
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,846
- Mrs. Queen?
- Hmm?

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,048
A Miss Smoak is here to see you.

168
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,686
- Who?
- Uh, me.

169
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,122
If you're looking for
Oliver, he's not here.

170
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,362
I know. I'm here to see you.

171
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,847
Really? What about?

172
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,530
Tempest.

173
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,448
I flagged a large wire transfer you made.

174
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,849
When I mentioned it to Walter,
he said he would talk to you about it.

175
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,371
I could tell on his face he wouldn't.
British people are really bad liars.

176
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,606
- Yes, they are.
- So I looked into it myself because...

177
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,249
full disclosure? I don't trust you.

178
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,408
You paid a substantial
sum of money to a Dr. Gill.

179
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,683
He was the the doctor who delivered Thea.
Which didn't make any sense to me.

180
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,929
So I went through a dozen different
theories until I remembered...

181
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,963
your testimony at trial.

182
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,687
You had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn.

183
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,531
One year before Thea was born.

184
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,729
Merlyn is Thea's father.

185
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,044
I can see why Walter and Oliver have
such a high appraisal of your capabilities.

186
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,641
So, what are you going to do
with this information...

187
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,445
Felicity?

188
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,922
I don't know. Confronting you in your
living room was as far as my plan went.

189
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,651
I thought you deserved
the chance to tell Oliver yourself.

190
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,285
He should hear it from you.

191
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,445
I'm not going to tell my son anything.
And neither are you.

192
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,609
If you won't keep
my secret for Oliver's sake...

193
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,689
you should keep it for your own.

194
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,241
I see the way you look at him.

195
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,169
You tell him this,
you will rip his world apart.

196
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,011
And a part of him will always blame you.

197
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,010
He'll hate me, for sure.

198
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,728
But he will hate you too.

199
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,565
We all have to keep secrets, Miss Smoak.

200
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,765
- You look different.
- I'm still me.

201
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,648
The Sara I know
wouldn't have betrayed us...

202
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,280
and fled Nanda Parbat
under the cover of darkness.

203
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,403
I didn't have a choice. The earthquake...

204
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,285
I needed to see my family.
Make sure they were safe.

205
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,130
And so they are.

206
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,889
Now come home.

207
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,929
I can't. I can't go back, Nyssa.

208
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,122
I don't have much of a soul left in me...

209
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,085
but what there is,
it can't take the killing anymore.

210
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,081
You swore an oath. My father
sent me here to make sure you honor it...

211
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,769
one way or another.

212
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,250
We both know the real reason
why you came here.

213
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,448
When I found you...

214
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,762
you were starving and alone,
simply waiting to die.

215
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,928
The League took you in...

216
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,530
nursed you back to health.

217
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,169
The only reason you're alive today
is because of me.

218
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,845
Hey, I wasn't with you
because you saved me...

219
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,327
I was with you because I loved you.

220
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,367
But not anymore.

221
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,490
Ra's listens to you
and you can ask him to release me.

222
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,411
My father has never
released anyone from the League.

223
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,886
He released Malcolm Merlyn.

224
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,687
An action he and the citizens
of this city dearly regret.

225
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,045
Do what you have to.

226
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,048
It's been two hours. And she should've
gotten in touch with me by now.

227
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,405
Felicity?

228
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,365
- Felicity!
- What?

229
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,610
- Sorry, what?
- Are you okay?

230
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,802
Uh, yeah. I'm fine.

231
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,726
- It's just... Things in here.
- The League's never going to let me go.

232
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,083
At least if I'm halfway around the world,
then I can keep my family safe.

233
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,682
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Just got a copy of Laurel's blood work.

234
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,282
- She tested negative for drugs.
- Well then, why did she collapse?

235
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,491
Because they found traces
of snake venom in her blood.

236
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,490
- From a Tibetan Pit Viper.
- Wait, so Laurel didn't OD?

237
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,590
She was poisoned.

238
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:51,345
She was poisoned by Nyssa who
did it to draw you back here.

239
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,331
- And it worked.
- My family's in danger.

240
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,922
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

241
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,766
Did you meet a boy at school?

242
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,367
Cut it out. Boys at school are lame.

243
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,247
How's everything with you and Oliver?

244
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,329
Great.

245
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,727
We decided to start looking
at apartments together.

246
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,847
I know it's a big step,
but we're ready.

247
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,567
I think we'll live together for a year,
engaged for another and then...

248
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,128
- Mrs. Laurel Queen.
- Maybe one day.

249
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,207
This is kind of assuming
that he's ever ready to settle down.

250
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,804
What's that supposed to mean?

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,970
We both know at least
10 girls that he's slept with.

252
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,603
Can't you just be happy for me?

253
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,322
I mean if you met some amazing guy...

254
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,764
who wanted to spend the rest of his life
with you, I'd be so supportive...

255
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,490
I wasn't trying to be a bitch.

256
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,001
The title of your autobiography.

257
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,928
I'm going to get some sleep.

258
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
Dad, it's my fault. I'm so sorry.

259
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,590
This assassins group that you're
part of, they took your mother.

260
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,204
- Not exactly.
- Well, what exactly?

261
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,286
A woman, Nyssa, she's a
powerful figure in the League.

262
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,146
She poisoned Laurel,
she took Mom.

263
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,778
Well, to get you to
come back to the League.

264
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,713
To get me to come back to her.

265
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,327
Oh.

266
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,326
Nyssa, don't do this.

267
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,285
I tried to warn you but
you wouldn't listen.

268
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,465
I thought would be instructive
for you to know what

269
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,548
it feels like to suddenly
lose someone you love.

270
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,771
To have them ripped
from your life without warning.

271
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,090
- You do not want to hurt my mother.
- You're right. I don't.

272
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,771
You have one day.

273
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,568
Make the right choice.

274
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,442
- We have 24 hours.
- Detective, we'll find her.

275
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,085
Okay, Laurel's inside, she's
losing her mind. I gotta go.

276
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,770
Keep me updated.

277
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,883
Come on. You ought to buy a ticket
if you're gonna play like that.

278
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,809
Hey kiddo, how's the apartment hunt going?

279
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,047
Terribly.

280
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,217
I really wanted to find
the perfect place to

281
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:59,394
show Ollie when he gets
back from his boat trip.

282
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,205
Everything good was already taken
by the time I walked in the door.

283
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,259
Maybe it's a sign that
you're not supposed to move

284
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,269
in with that frat boy that
you call your boyfriend.

285
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,250
You and Mom were my age when
you moved into that place on Spring Street.

286
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,771
You weren't even engaged yet.

287
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,884
That's because your mother
kept turning down all my proposals.

288
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,609
- She did?
- You know your mother...

289
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,764
free spirit and all. "Why do
we need rings when we have love?"

290
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,470
You know I spent a year with that damn ring
burning a hole in my pocket?

291
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,642
Significant news day here in Starling.

292
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,650
Queen's Gambit sent a mayday
transmission late last night...

293
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,524
and has not been heard from since.

294
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,969
Among those missing are locals
Robert and Oliver Queen.

295
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,326
Do we have a lead on Dinah?

296
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,602
We researched the poison
Nyssa used on Laurel.

297
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,367
Lucky for us, Tibetan Pit Viper venom
is surprisingly difficult to transport.

298
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,251
It starts losing its potency the moment
it leave the fangs.

299
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,046
Another sentence
I never thought I'd actually say aloud.

300
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,528
- So it was bought locally.
- Not bought. Stolen.

301
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,290
- From where?
- The zoo.

302
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,561
A local break-in.

303
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,764
The perps didn't steal
anything so the cops chalked

304
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,635
it up to a bunch of kids
looking for a thrill.

305
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,566
I pulled up the zoo CCTV footage from the
night of the break-in. I got a plate.

306
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,604
Car is a rental. Address is in the Glades.

307
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,490
Sara. Call your father.

308
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,647
Sebastian, I am so sorry.
I have a bad habit of standing you up.

309
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,844
Look, I know you have to pull your support
from my campaign.

310
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,442
Blood is thicker than politics.
And it should be.

311
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,201
Thank you for understanding. And I really
hope that this doesn't affect our friendship.

312
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,920
- It's important to me.
- And to me.

313
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,526
Can I help you, alderman?

314
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,281
Oh, I had a meeting with your son.
I'm sure you can guess the topic.

315
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,490
I hope my decision to run against you
for mayor doesn't affect your relationship.

316
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,968
Out of respect for that relationship,
can I offer some advice?

317
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,607
- Please.
- Get out. Now.

318
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,762
The fact that you're advising me to get out
before I even announce my candidacy...

319
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,724
suggests that you're threatened.

320
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,526
I'm apprehensive
about destroying my friend's mother.

321
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,121
- I can take care of myself.
- Really?

322
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,403
During your trial, you portrayed yourself
as a fragile creature...

323
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,002
living under Malcolm Merlyn's thumb.
So which is it?

324
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,009
The woman strong enough to lead the city
or the one too weak-willed to save it?

325
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,881
The one who should not be underestimated.

326
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,966
- So, what exactly is the plan here?
- We wait.

327
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,849
The Arrow will lead him right to us.

328
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,956
You know, you never did tell me how you
joined up with the Arrow in the first place.

329
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:43,087
Where did you two even meet?

330
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,088
Vigilante club.

331
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,122
Same old Sara.

332
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,681
Well, not exactly the same.

333
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,683
I loved her, Dad.

334
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,166
Are you upset?

335
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,166
Honestly, Sara?

336
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,651
To think what you've been through
these past 6 years, pain, loneliness...

337
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,882
I'm just happy to hear you had someone
that cared for you.

338
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,510
What's the matter, they didn't teach you
about right crosses in assassins' school?

339
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,841
- Where is Nyssa?
- Tell me where my wife is.

340
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,120
- What the hell is he saying?
- He's praying.

341
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,165
No, don't...

342
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,083
Son of a bitch.

343
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,201
It's over, detective.

344
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,168
He's gone.

345
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,408
- How's Sara holding up?
- Not well.

346
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,464
And I need you to pick
up the trail on Nyssa.

347
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,231
Because Mrs. Lance is
running out of time.

348
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,044
I'm on it.

349
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,764
- Ah, Oliver. Felicity.
- Hi. Hi.

350
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,929
Well, I haven't been this nervous
since my wedding day.

351
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,930
- Both of them.
- Moira, it's time.

352
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,031
Oliver, you ready to
introduce your mother?

353
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:30,056
With pride.

354
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,326
Felicity? Felicity.

355
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,880
What is going on with you?

356
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,970
- And don't say... don't say nothing.
- Nothing...

357
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,209
The truth, please.

358
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,160
- You might have noticed that I talk a lot.
- It has not escaped my attention.

359
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,284
You might have also noticed
that I don't talk a lot about my family.

360
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,641
I have noticed that.

361
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,362
My mother is...

362
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,289
She's my mother.

363
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,802
And I don't really know what my father
is because he abandoned us.

364
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,961
I barely remember him.

365
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,643
But I do remember
how much it hurt when he left.

366
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,762
And just the thought of losing someone
that important to me again...

367
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,008
Hey.

368
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,685
You're not gonna lose me.

369
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,924
Whatever it is that's bothering you,
is it about your family?

370
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,130
No.

371
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,009
It's about yours.

372
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
Time's up.

373
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,401
Have you made your decision?

374
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,922
Let my mother go.

375
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,521
And I will return with you to Nanda Parbat.

376
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,883
You're doing the right thing, Sara.

377
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,441
For both of us.

378
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,726
Here you go, sweetie.
Chamomile, like you like.

379
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,321
Is there anything else I can get you?

380
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,723
My mother.

381
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,724
Although there's something
I gotta tell you.

382
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,961
It's about your sister.

383
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,320
What about her?

384
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,250
- Hello.
- Dad.

385
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,883
I found Mom. Meet me at the lower boatyards
in 30 minutes and come alone.

386
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,402
- Don't tell the Arrow.
- Copy that.

387
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,567
- I gotta go.
- What about Sara, Dad?

388
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,003
Look, I'll explain everything later,
all right? Just sit tight.

389
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,566
I say this with confidence
because the Moira Queen that I know...

390
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,809
is more than a successful CEO
and philanthropist.

391
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,046
She is a loving mother who has devoted
her life to raising two wonderful children.

392
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,450
Just to tell you how special she is,
I'd like to welcome her son...

393
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,611
CEO of Queen Consolidated,
Mr. Oliver Queen.

394
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,688
Ooh. Thank you. Ahem.

395
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,009
I'm here today to say a few words...

396
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,607
about Moira Queen.

397
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,007
I bet many of you think that you know her
because you...

398
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,566
read about her in the press...

399
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,922
or you saw her on TV,
but I can promise you...

400
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,882
you don't know my mother.

401
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,087
You don't know her like I do.

402
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,285
And you don't know what she's capable of...

403
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,566
when it comes to helping the people
of Starling City.

404
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:05,730
Ladies and gentlemen, my mother,
Moira Queen.

405
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,081
I know.

406
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,929
Thank you.

407
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,451
Thank you, Starling City.

408
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,685
Sara.

409
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,241
The snake venom. It's gone.

410
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,482
- She found Nyssa.
- She's going to poison her?

411
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,843
We need to stop her before she does.
Activate her tracer.

412
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,070
You put a tracer on her?

413
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,233
She has a bad habit
of disappearing on me.

414
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,129
I hate to sound cold,
but why do we care...

415
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,160
if Sara kills some bad-ass assassin
who wants to get her and her family?

416
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,890
Because, Diggle, if half of the stories that
I've heard about Ra's Al Ghul are true...

417
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,367
Sara kills his daughter...

418
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,927
we will all pay.

419
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,163
They're coming for you now.

420
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,409
Dinah. Move away from her. Move away.

421
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,807
It's all right. It's all right.

422
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,843
What's happening?

423
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,889
Sara.

424
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,329
It's me, Mom.

425
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,729
It's me.

426
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,962
My baby.

427
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,331
My baby.

428
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,363
Oh, my baby.

429
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,848
I love you so much, Mom.

430
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,124
- I have to go.
- What?

431
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,641
- What are you doing?
- Dad, get Mom out of here.

432
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,251
What?

433
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,284
No. No!

434
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,564
No!

435
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,007
You took the poison.

436
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,565
No.

437
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,925
No.

438
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,243
No!

439
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,444
I can't go back.

440
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,124
I can't take the killing anymore.
It needs to end.

441
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,367
Sara.

442
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,370
Delta-Charlie 52 to Central, we need backup
at the lower boatyards.

443
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,881
Ambulance, paramedics.

444
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:34,324
If you want to be with your family so
badly, they can join you in eternity.

445
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,691
You get the hell away from my daughter.

446
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,485
Live or die.

447
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,569
It's up to you.

448
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,046
Nyssa. I can still save her.

449
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,810
Worry more about saving yourself.

450
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,325
Don't kill her. Please.

451
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,884
Sara.

452
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,450
Sara.

453
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,011
Sara, you hold on.

454
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,049
Stay with me.

455
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,969
Come on, stay.

456
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,925
Not again.

457
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,803
No more killing.

458
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,524
Nyssa.

459
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,484
Please.

460
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,203
In the name of Ra's Al Ghul...

461
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,803
I release you.

462
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,927
Sara. Sweetheart, you okay?

463
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,646
- Are you okay? Oh.
- Yeah, yeah.

464
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,925
I can't believe it. Look at you.

465
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,925
Because Starling City is our city.

466
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,404
And starting today, we're
going to take it back.

467
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,889
I know we need to talk.

468
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,206
You need to listen.

469
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,364
For the past year,
I've stood by your side.

470
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,405
And I've fought...

471
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,926
because I wanted
to believe that you weren't this...

472
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,645
monster.

473
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,348
And I needed to believe
I still had a mother.

474
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:55,373
You do.

475
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,609
Oliver, I only lied about Thea
to protect her from Malcolm.

476
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,446
No, you lied because that's what you do.

477
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,249
And that is who you are, Mom.

478
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,441
Lies.

479
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,526
And now you've made me a liar out of me.

480
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,923
Because Thea can never find out
about Merlyn.

481
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,406
And she can never know
the truth about us.

482
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,411
Which is that as of right now,
we have no relationship.

483
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,890
I will keep up appearances
for Thea's sake...

484
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,046
publicly I will support your campaign.

485
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,044
But privately...

486
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,691
you and I are done.

487
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,410
Oliver.

488
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,330
Oliver.

489
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,884
Oliver!

490
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,249
I knew you were alive.

491
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,761
I just felt it in my bones.

492
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,486
I never stopped looking for you.

493
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,242
I know you have a lot of questions.

494
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,886
Nope.

495
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,162
How could you not have any questions?

496
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,490
Because I already know
all of the answers to them.

497
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,288
How could you still be alive?
Where have you been all this time?

498
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,642
Why didn't you call us?

499
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,811
And the answer to all of them...

500
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,491
is because it's Sara.

501
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,803
- Baby, don't to this.
- Dad, I swear, if you say one more word...

502
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,924
Laurel, look, I know you're angry.

503
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,042
And you have every right to be.

504
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,040
Please don't take this out on Dad.
If you need someone to blame, you blame me.

505
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,043
I do blame you, Sara.

506
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,811
Every single thing that's gone wrong
in our lives is your fault.

507
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,409
You got on that stupid boat
with my boyfriend.

508
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,771
You didn't call us
to tell us that you were still alive...

509
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,685
even though it would have probably
saved Mom and Dad's marriage.

510
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,845
And you brought some crazy assassin
into Starling City who nearly killed Mom...

511
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,769
and who poisoned me.

512
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,770
You.

513
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,089
You stole my whole life
away from me.

514
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,760
- Now, get out.
- Laurel.

515
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,167
Get out.

516
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,051
- I'm sorry.
- I said get out!

517
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,051
Now what?

518
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,164
Please, come in.

519
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,928
Tell me Oliver's okay.

520
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,844
Tell me everything's okay.

521
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,769
I wish I could.

522
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,169
Moira, I'm so sorry about Robert.
About Oliver.

523
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,970
I really am.

524
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,811
Is... em...

525
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,681
I need to tell you both something.

526
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,925
What is it?

527
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,207
Robert and Oliver
weren't the only ones lost.

528
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,363
Along with the crew...

529
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,491
a friend invited along
by Oliver at the last minute.

530
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,086
Tommy?

531
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,044
No.

532
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,047
Sara.

533
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,609
Your Sara.

534
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,007
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

535
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,607
The dockmaster saw her
sneak on board.

536
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,091
With Moira Queen's
impressive speech earlier today...

537
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,449
some pundits are suggesting
her candidacy may not be so farfetched.

538
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,450
While Blood's campaign
has yet to issue a public response...

539
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,170
to Mrs. Queen's announcement...

540
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,846
I warned you not to underestimate
Moira Queen.

541
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,644
What do you want me to do?

542
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,488
Thank you. Thank you, Starling City!

543
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,605
Nothing.

544
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,924
I'll take care of it.

545
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,129
You've been crying.

546
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,643
I was happy to know I still could.

547
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,606
Are you okay?

548
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,971
Laurel wasn't as thrilled
to see me as you thought.

549
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,245
Give her time.

550
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,128
I gave her six years.

551
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,121
What exactly are you taking out
on that dummy?

552
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,925
My mother...

553
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,769
She's not who I thought she was.

554
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,928
I guess it's going around.

555
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,685
So, what now?

556
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,885
I don't know.

557
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,684
I don't either.

558
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,250
I know one thing.

559
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,611
What's that?

560
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,965
I'm home.
