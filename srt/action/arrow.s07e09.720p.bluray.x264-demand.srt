1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,918
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,674
<i>After 6 months in hell,
I have been released from prison</i>

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,559
<i>and returned home
with only one goal...</i>

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,435
<i>to save my city,
but things have changed.</i>

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,000
<i>Instead of operating
outside the law,</i>

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,191
<i>I am now working
alongside the police.</i>

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,194
<i>I am no longer inmate 4587.</i>

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,034
<i>I am once more
the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,473
<i>Previously on</i> the Flash...

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,393
<i>Dr. John Deegan,</i>

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,195
use this book
to reshape the world

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,510
as you see fit.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,475
I can see everything.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,874
Barry,
are you OK?

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm Barry.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
I'm Oliver Queen.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,397
Maybe it's just Earth 1
that's been affected.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,199
If we can get
to Earth 38 and find Kara,

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,119
if she remembers us, then maybe she
can help fix whatever's happening.

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,720
Whoa, Lois.
Wait, wait.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,480
This is Barry and Oliver.
They're friends.

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,711
So you know that I'm
Oliver and he's Barry?

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,718
- Why wouldn't I?
- We could use your help.

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,713
<i>I vibed somebody
in the speed lab,</i>

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,712
some guy with ridges
on his head.

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I know where to find him.

27
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:02,516
So what's our
next move?

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,513
<i>We're going
to Gotham City.</i>

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,516
<i>Ohh!</i>

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,752
OK. I know this sounds nuts
and completely unscientific,

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,936
but I think that freaking
lightning is following us.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,191
- Focus, Curtis.
<i>- This is me focusing.</i>

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,936
<i>These atmospheric anomalies
are playing all kinds</i>

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,030
<i>of hell on my equipment,</i>

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,376
plus you don't want
that lightning to hit

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,920
when you're engaging
Deathstroke's son.

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
I just had to say it.

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,033
<i>Kane Wolfman,
you're under arrest</i>

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,232
for 19 violations
of international law!

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,710
Really? Does that
include the murder of...

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,278
1, 2, 3, 4...

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,794
4 A.R.G.U.S.
field agents?

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,678
Last chance!
On the ground now!

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,035
This isn't personal.
Just business.

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,360
Son of a bitch.

46
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,994
Is that any way to
greet your friends?

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,520
All I know is that whenever
the three of you show up,

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,071
it usually means we have
one huge problem.

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,635
So you're you.

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,311
And you're you.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,712
An immortal Egyptian,
aliens, parallel Earth Nazis.

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,719
I have no idea why I'm not
even surprised at this point.

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,176
I'm still trying
to figure out if this is

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,078
more like <i>Freaky Friday</i>
or <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,616
No. If this were
like <i>Quantum Leap,</i>

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,711
I'd only look like
myself in the mirror.

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Yep. You are definitely
not Oliver Queen.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,234
We think that
the red skies

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
and these lightning strikes
have to be related

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,240
to whatever happened to
Barry and Oliver somehow.

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,591
We need you to solve the
somehow while we're in Gotham.

62
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,513
No problem.
I mean, A.R.G.U.S. has

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,160
all the best
analytic toys,

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,576
but what we really need is a
pattern recognition algorithm,

65
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,776
and, unfortunately,
Felicity isn't...

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,096
- I called Felicity.
- Wait, wait.

67
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,216
- You called Felicity?
- Yeah.

68
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,118
OK. Right. Well,
I guess that makes sense

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,158
because technically,
you are her husband.

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
I'm confused.

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,558
I've been summoned?

72
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,753
- Yes. Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,576
I mean, things might be fraught between us,
Oliver.

74
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,616
That doesn't mean I'm
not gonna show up.

75
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,552
They are? They are?

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,631
They are. Yeah,
which is... Sad.

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,479
So, um, this
lightning thing.

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,040
Um, could you help
me out with that?

79
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,456
Can I kind of show you
kind of what I'm thinking?

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,630
- Yeah.
- OK.

81
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,998
OK. So why didn't
you tell Felicity?

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,096
Well, because we tried to tell
everybody at s.T.A.R. Labs,

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,560
and it didn't really
go over so well.

84
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,176
<i>Felicity and I have
enough problems as it is</i>

85
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,680
without introducing
body swapping.

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,116
We thought we'd just
let her think everything's

87
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,590
normal and that Barry
and I are solving

88
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,720
another problem.

89
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,521
If you find out
how this lightning thing

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,315
relates to whatever it is
that we're dealing with here,

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
can you please tell us?

92
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,481
Copy that.

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,960
Hey. This thing isn't
gonna be permanent, is it?

94
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,315
- I hope not.
- I hope not.

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Jinx.

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,149
Oh. Barry, there's something I'd
like to discuss before we go.

97
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,136
- What's that?
- That you probably shouldn't go.

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
What?

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,760
Oliver Queen is
a public figure

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,440
and an infamous vigilante.

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,056
If you are in Gotham City,
you're attracting

102
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,376
the type of attention
that we don't want.

103
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,153
No. If...
If Gotham can handle the Batman,

104
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
it can handle
the Green Arrow.

105
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,200
The Batman's
an urban legend.

106
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,075
Wait.
You don't believe Batman's real?

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,833
He's not real.
He's an urban legend

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
concocted by the Gotham
police department

109
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
to scare criminals.

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,917
And I'm the original
vigilante, Barry.

111
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,616
OK, if you guys are done
fooling around...

112
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,496
actually, you know what?
Could you pull that thing up?

113
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,976
Because, unlike you,
my identity's not public,

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,096
and I'd like to keep
it that way.

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
This isn't your real face!

116
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
It might end up
being my real face

117
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,597
if we don't sort this mess out,
so could you?

118
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,032
- Happy?
- Ecstatic.

119
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,080
Apparently, you guys
aren't done fooling around.

120
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,554
Well, I guess
I'm running alone.

121
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,675
Ho ho ho!
That is so awesome.

122
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,794
So this is Gotham.

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,632
Doesn't look
so tough to me.

124
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Where's Oliver?

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,279
Huh. I don't know.

126
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,200
Guess he's still getting
the hang of it.

127
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,430
Ha ha ha!

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,856
I'm still getting
the hang of it.

129
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,519
All right.
All right.

130
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,194
So how do we find
two people

131
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,953
in a city
of 1.6 million?

132
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,994
There is a radio personality
named Vesper Fairchild.

133
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,256
She knows everyone
in Gotham,

134
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
and I know her.

135
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:00,936
She was doing an exposé
on white-collar crime

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
back in the day,
and I wanted to persuade her

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,433
that Queen consolidated
was above board.

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,040
So you slept
with her, right?

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,632
No. I... I don't know.

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,270
Gosh. You really got around back
in the day, didn't you?

141
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,955
Oh. One time,
Oliver cheated on his girlfriend

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
with her sister.

143
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,793
- Barry!
- Oh, no! Ohh!

144
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,996
What?
You did!

145
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,073
So, what, depending on this past
relationship with this woman,

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,999
we might have to come up
with a plan "b."

147
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,355
Is that what
you're saying?

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,440
- Yeah.
- Guys!

149
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,115
Take a look
at this.

150
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
You still think
he's a myth?

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,231
Yeah! Let's go.

152
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,319
Batman's real.

153
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,040
Come on.

154
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,920
If I remember right,

155
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:13,151
the radio station
was this way.

156
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm surprised they put it
in the bad part of town.

157
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,176
It's cute how you think
there's a good part of town.

158
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,256
<i>Looks like
the one percenters</i>

159
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,714
bring the good part
with them.

160
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,000
This is why nobody
talks about Gotham, OK?

161
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,839
City might as well
be dead.

162
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,320
<i>Sounds like you guys aren't
from around here.</i>

163
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,274
Probably don't know,

164
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,116
but Gotham tourism Bureau
collects a tax

165
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,555
on out-of-towners,

166
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,555
so phones, wallets,
watches now.

167
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,951
You know what, fellas?
I... we don't want any trouble,

168
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,555
so maybe we can just
talk this out, OK?

169
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,673
Talk it out.

170
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,077
OK. I'll talk first.

171
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Hey!

172
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,869
Agh!

173
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,514
Oh, great.

174
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,679
On the ground now!

175
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,752
All of you, on the ground!
Show me your hands!

176
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,670
Oh, crap.

177
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,120
I need SWAT
at Nolan and Burton.

178
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,071
Green Arrow sighted at
Nolan and Burton.

179
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,197
Sir, we don't want
any trouble.

180
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,920
Yeah. Tell that
to Oliver Queen here.

181
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Oliver,
stand down.

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,031
Pattern recognition algo
is locked and loaded.

183
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,470
Bringing it
online now.

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,016
You realize that this
may not work, right?

185
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,271
Like, there may not be
a pattern to recognize.

186
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,231
Is there a suggestion bound
within that dose of pessimism?

187
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,736
Does the energy discharge
of the lightning

188
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,989
look familiar
to you?

189
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,616
The quantum amplitude is consistent
with a dimensional breach.

190
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,757
Exactly.
We're gonna need Cisco's help on this one.

191
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,719
I've been summoned!

192
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,840
OK. That was a disturbingly
coincidental entrance.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,070
It wasn't
coincidental.

194
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,800
We'd been getting
the same red skies

195
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,400
and freaky lightning
in Central City,

196
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,640
and I'll tell you this much...
it wasn't speed force.

197
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,800
Wait, wait. Hold up.
"We'd been," "wasn't,"

198
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,320
as in past tense?

199
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,376
Interestingly,
the atmospheric Phenomenon ceased

200
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,136
the moment Barry and
Oliver left Central City.

201
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,720
It's like it packed up its
bags and followed them here.

202
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,956
That's why we came.

203
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,296
The Phenomenon has to be
related to Barry and Oliver's...

204
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,198
- OK, Caitlin. OK?
- Body swap?

205
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,636
Ahem. Don't...
don't say... ahem.

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,957
I'm sorry.
Body... body what?

207
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,910
You, uh... you
didn't tell her?

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,796
Again,
tell me... heh... what?

209
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,911
Um, excuse me,
officer.

210
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Were you able to get
in touch with Laurel Lance

211
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,359
at the Star City
D.A.'s office or...

212
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,274
yeah.
She said, uh, "I think a night in jail

213
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,715
would do them
some good."

214
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Heh.

215
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,034
What were you
thinking?

216
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,839
That you were about to
get yourself shot.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,336
- You're welcome.
- I was deescalating

218
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,953
the situation,
you know, like, uh...

219
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,190
- like I would?
- Uh-huh!

220
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
Guess what, man.

221
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,634
I handled it exactly
how you would!

222
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
OK. You guys, maybe taking
on each other's personalities

223
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,832
worked for amazo,
but you were not gonna

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
talk your way out
of getting mugged,

225
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,360
and you escalated the
situation way too fast.

226
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,536
So what would you
have done?

227
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,598
What I would have done is
supersped us right out of there.

228
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,075
All they would have
seen is a gust of wind.

229
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,238
I mean, hindsight
is 20/20,

230
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,616
but we'll follow
your lead next time.

231
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,936
Because there will
really be a next time

232
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,158
when someone threatens 3
superheroes with a gun.

233
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,676
Good news.

234
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,560
Somebody posted
your bail.

235
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,474
- Who?
- I don't know.

236
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,216
Guess someone wanted to make
you guys their headache

237
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,356
instead of mine.

238
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,274
We'll show
ourselves out.

239
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,590
Please come with me.

240
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,309
I'm guessing this belongs
to whoever bailed us out.

241
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
I really think
we've had

242
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,000
enough distractions
for one night.

243
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Yeah. I agree
with my friend.

244
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:33,396
We appreciate
the early release, whatever,

245
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,597
but we're really fine
on our own.

246
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,911
I'm afraid
my employer insists.

247
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,589
OK.

248
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,956
And you said it
wouldn't happen again.

249
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,479
Bruce Wayne got
us out of jail?

250
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,470
Doesn't sound
like him.

251
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,759
No, it wasn't.
Wayne left Gotham 3 years ago.

252
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,555
Why?
To go where?

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,150
No one knows.

254
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,158
So who's Manning
the shop now?

255
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,680
Apparently after he left,
Bruce's board of directors

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,999
went to town with a bunch of
aggressive get-rich-quick deals.

257
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,674
<i>Yeah, but
an abandoned building</i>

258
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,639
didn't bail us
out, right?

259
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,595
Whoa.
That is definitely not Bruce Wayne.

260
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,354
Oliver Queen.

261
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Ahem.

262
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,074
Yeah, yeah.
I'm Oliver Queen. Yeah.

263
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,751
- And you are?
- The rain on your parade.

264
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,160
If you're visiting Gotham
to compare grappling hooks

265
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,197
with Batman, you are
out of luck.

266
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,994
No one's seen him
in years.

267
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,356
Told you.

268
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Myth.

269
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,799
I would never compare
myself to a total badass

270
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
like Batman.

271
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,352
What I think Oliver
is trying to say

272
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,080
is thank you for
getting us out of jail.

273
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,317
What Oliver's
actually trying to say is

274
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,109
who are you,
and why are you helping us?

275
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,039
Gotham has enough problems
without a guy

276
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,675
in green leather showing
off his Arrows to everyone,

277
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,193
so the faster you find
what you're looking for,

278
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,160
the faster you can get
the hell out of my city.

279
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,696
Uh, but, what... what
should we call you...

280
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,552
rain, Ms. Parade?

281
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,357
Kane, Kate Kane.

282
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,754
She's cool.

283
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,680
You didn't tell her?!

284
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,957
Oliver... the actual
Oliver thought they had

285
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,112
enough problems
with Felicity already.

286
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,800
Oh, and you didn't think to
loop us in on the fact that you

287
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,040
were keeping the <i>Freaky Friday</i>
situation on the hush?

288
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,936
I was thinking it was more
like <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

289
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,056
Well, if this were
like <i>Quantum Leap,</i>

290
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,856
they'd only look like themselves when
they see themselves in the mirror...

291
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,496
It depends on what type
of Quantum Leap...

292
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,801
Shouldn't we concentrate on
what this lightning came from?

293
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,638
- Right?
- Right, but...

294
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Oh. Ahem.

295
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,656
OK, guys. You don't
need to tip-toe around me.

296
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,160
It's just a lot
to process.

297
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,016
It's not every day that
you find out that your ex

298
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,240
is your husband
and vice-versa.

299
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,472
Yeah. Iris was, pretty freaked out,
too, when she sussed it out.

300
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,438
Wait. Iris.

301
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,120
You know, actually, John...
right before you came in,

302
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,536
John was just saying that we need
to really handle that lightning...

303
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,256
Iris was able to tell
that something was off with Barry?

304
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,476
- No, not exactly.
- Oh, totally. I mean,

305
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,160
it was like lover's intuition.
- Stop.

306
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,616
That's how you can
tell these two were...

307
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,360
you know, Felicity, um, there's something
very strange going on here,

308
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,597
so I wouldn't take this
as a commentary

309
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,035
on you and Oliver's
marriage.

310
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,720
No. My marriage
with Oliver is strained

311
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
by the fact that we've
become different people...

312
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,793
quite literally
in Oliver's case.

313
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,616
If the lightning strikes are
attempted dimensional breaches,

314
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,496
there might be a way to
stabilize the quantum flux

315
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,115
to allow whatever's trying to get
through to get through, right?

316
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,197
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

317
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,639
You guys try
facial recognition?

318
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
One of Bruce's R&D guys
still works in the building.

319
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,834
I can give this
to him.

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,275
Uh, we did try it,

321
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,875
so thank you,
but no luck.

322
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,236
Besides, I'd think
if Wayne's R&D's

323
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,496
in the same shape
as this building,

324
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,000
it's not gonna really
do us any good.

325
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Suit yourself.

326
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,960
Seems strange,
doesn't it,

327
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,438
that Bruce Wayne and
Batman disappeared

328
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,159
from Gotham around
the same time.

329
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,517
Well, when Batman
left, the city went

330
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,869
to 5 different kinds
of hell,

331
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,839
which for Gotham is
really saying something.

332
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,674
Took a toll on Bruce.

333
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,196
Is that why he left?

334
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,120
Still trying to
figure that out.

335
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,680
<i>Right, but you
work for him,</i>

336
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,160
and you don't know
why he left?

337
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Who said I work
for him?

338
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
How'd it go
with Vesper?

339
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,110
She hung up
on me.

340
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,000
Apparently, I did
sleep with her.

341
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,256
- Hmm.
<i>- OK. The building is</i>

342
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,839
under renovation,
so this is

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,878
the best place for you
guys to work out of.

344
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,714
Oh, and the, uh,
wi-fi password's "Alfred."

345
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,600
So if Vesper's not
gonna help us,

346
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,800
we're just back
at square one.

347
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,593
No, we're not.
I lifted this off

348
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,114
of a computer
at the precinct.

349
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,118
It should have
the entire GCPD database.

350
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,674
You stole data
from the police?

351
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,355
No. No. The flash
did it.

352
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,517
- It's not funny.
- I'm not laughing.

353
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,033
Did you lose the coin flip on
who has to come talk to me?

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,879
We didn't flip coins.
We drew straws.

355
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,832
I'm kidding.
Actually, I wanted to come talk to you

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,640
because I think I've got a
little bit more experience

357
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,359
with alternate realities
than you do.

358
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,593
So what words of wisdom
do you have for me?

359
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,872
That Iris probably has a little
bit more experience, as well,

360
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,437
and maybe that's why
she would have seen

361
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,636
something that
you didn't.

362
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,472
As for Oliver keeping
you in the dark,

363
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,039
when he and Barry tried to tell
us what was going on with them,

364
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,875
we knocked them unconscious and
locked them in the pipeline.

365
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,512
- Seriously?
- Wasn't our finest moment.

366
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,352
Look. I'm sure that
that's the reason

367
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,160
that Oliver didn't want to
take any chances with you.

368
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,197
I appreciate you
saying that...

369
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,795
But it's just another excuse
in a long list of excuses

370
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,030
for Oliver's behavior.

371
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,759
Oliver does love you,
Felicity.

372
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,835
Yeah? Well, what's love
without respect or trust?

373
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,070
I don't know,

374
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,718
but as long
as there is love,

375
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,794
you can't give up
on it.

376
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,034
<i>That's the one thing
I do know</i>

377
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,358
after everything
I've been through,

378
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,320
everything
I've suffered.

379
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Thank you.

380
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,736
Well, one good thing
about what's going on

381
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,911
is that I have something
to distract me.

382
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Look at this.

383
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,757
- That looks like...
- A quantum flux anchor.

384
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
<i>I'm pretty sure
if we build it,</i>

385
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,875
whoever's trying
to breach through will come.

386
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,915
Let's get to work.

387
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,231
You really know
your way with a computer.

388
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,676
Well, when I was first starting out,
I had to hold my own

389
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,274
before Felicity
showed up.

390
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,878
Got him.
John Deegan.

391
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,238
Oh. Illegal
experimentation, torture.

392
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,836
Hmm. Seems like he was
conducting experiments

393
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,559
on his own patients' brains.

394
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,029
Sounds like
a real charmer.

395
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,799
Well, he was acquitted.
All the charges

396
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,360
were dropped
on technicalities.

397
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,113
So where can we
find him now?

398
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,272
- No known address.
- What about employment?

399
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
Well, he was fired,
suspended

400
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
by the medical board
for two years,

401
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,160
but that was...
5 years ago.

402
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,758
- So no idea where to find him.
- No.

403
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,274
Except somewhere
in Gotham.

404
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,910
Needle in haystack.

405
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,276
- All right.
- Where you going?

406
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm gonna put on
my work clothes

407
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,600
and do an X-ray flyby
of the city.

408
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,752
I don't think miss Kate
would be too thrilled

409
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,832
with us running
around her city.

410
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
Well, unless she has some
kryptonite stashed somewhere,

411
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
I'm really not worried.

412
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,191
Heh. You lost?

413
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,079
No. No.
Um, just needed to clear my head for a sec.

414
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Actually, you know what?

415
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,554
I'm sorry

416
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,110
about the third degree
earlier.

417
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,993
I guess the name
Bruce Wayne carries

418
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,119
a certain notoriety.

419
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,875
Oh, I know.
Bruce Wayne's my cousin.

420
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,156
Your cousin?

421
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,880
That makes
a lot of sense.

422
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,192
Actually, I'm
in the process

423
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,757
of turning this building into a
real estate development firm,

424
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,433
so this is
me hijacking his office.

425
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,158
My cousin's actually
friends with Bruce.

426
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,029
Um, well, frenemies.

427
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,594
- Hmm.
- Heh.

428
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,630
Do you ever wonder
if trying to keep

429
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,996
his private life
from the public eye

430
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,915
just got to be too much
for him and he broke?

431
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,195
Heh. Sitting
at that desk,

432
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,957
staring
out that window,

433
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,556
watching this city
that we grew up in

434
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,712
rot at its core,

435
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,716
you find a way
to not break.

436
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,917
Bruce didn't leave
Gotham without a fight.

437
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,315
Hmm.

438
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,713
You know, I got to say,
all the corporate billionaires I know

439
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,874
wear versace and have
500 fewer tattoos.

440
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Hmm. Those are the ones
that you can see.

441
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,194
Well, that's a mystery.

442
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,520
Oh. Is this the...
the old bard himself? Ha!

443
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,913
Hey. You... you wouldn't happen
to know a John Deegan, would you?

444
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,913
I would, actually.

445
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,473
He's a doctor
at arkham asylum.

446
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,515
Ah. I have to go
tell the boys.

447
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,117
Uh, hey.
Thanks for the help and the chat.

448
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,430
What the hell
is this?

449
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,976
No offense,
but you'd need, like,

450
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,957
5 Ph.D.s for
the dumbed-down version.

451
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,793
How about the very
dumbed-down version?

452
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,360
It's a quantum flux anchor
that utilizes wave theory

453
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,596
to fire nano-particulates

454
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,035
across
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge

455
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,959
to create
a secure claxon field.

456
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,517
How about the very, very,
dumbed-down version?

457
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,876
Felicity made a magnet
that will draw whoever's

458
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,072
trying to breach through
to us.

459
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,919
You could have
just said that.

460
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,873
All right.
Field's stable.

461
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,430
All readings are in the green.
You guys are good to go.

462
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,552
I'm reading multiple
quantum surges.

463
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,473
I don't think
this is working!

464
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,638
This is what working
looks like!

465
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,680
Man, Voice cutting in and out:
Ca... you... Hear me?

466
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,600
You've got... To...
Get... Book.

467
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,796
Jay?

468
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,520
Only... Book... Make this right.

469
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,836
If you get the book,
you can fix this.

470
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,235
Am I the only one who
thought that was very cool?

471
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,440
So we're sure
he works here?

472
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,496
Well, it's probably too late
for him to still be at work,

473
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,920
but if we find
his office, maybe

474
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,838
we can find his home
address or something.

475
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,696
Do you think you have enough
of a grip on your powers

476
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,154
to do a superspeed
reconnaissance?

477
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,176
I don't think that we
should risk it if I don't.

478
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,998
OK. Well, then,
we break in,

479
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,954
do some old-fashioned
snooping.

480
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
- Ohh!
- Aah!

481
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Aah!

482
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,880
- Got new intel.
- Those lightning strikes,

483
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,560
they were a flash
from another dimension

484
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,716
trying to breach to us.

485
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,553
We think it was
Jay Garrick

486
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,558
or a Jay Garrick.

487
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,000
He said to fix
the situation,

488
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,549
we have to
"get the book."

489
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
<i>John Deegan
was reading a book</i>

490
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,914
in the drawing
Oliver drew.

491
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,992
OK. So we find
the book in there

492
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,470
or we find Deegan,
and we make him tell us where it is.

493
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,832
Wait, wait. Hold on.
Another flash from a parallel universe

494
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,096
just lightnings in, tells us to jump,
and we ask, "how high?"

495
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,032
If we want to sort
this thing out, then yes.

496
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,160
I have no idea how we're
gonna break into a mental asylum.

497
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,990
I have some ideas.

498
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,194
Uh, how can I help you?

499
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,074
New patient transfer
from Gotham Central Hospital.

500
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,433
Dr. Danvers said arkham was
the more appropriate place

501
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,479
to treat her...
Condition.

502
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
What's the diagnosis?

503
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,552
Persistent subthermal
homeostasis

504
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,554
with, uh, involuntary
gelid substantiation.

505
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,675
She gets cold
and freezes stuff.

506
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,753
Yeah. We got a few of those
in here like that.

507
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,072
- Fill this out.
- OK.

508
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,716
We'll take it
from here.

509
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,800
Officer Allen,
it really is very...

510
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,216
this is a GCPD-A.R.G.U.S. operation.

511
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,356
We don't need your help.

512
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Whew.

513
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,872
Barry... I mean,
Oliver, look.

514
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,876
John Deegan.

515
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,240
Oliver Queen!
Ha ha! Whew.

516
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,996
It's a genuine pleasure
to meet you, sir.

517
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,536
He knows
who you really are.

518
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,880
<i>Gentlemen,
I was thinking,</i>

519
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,556
"why did I not become
the flash?"

520
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,158
And it seems
changing reality itself,

521
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,632
it's got a bit
of a learning curve,

522
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,672
so, yeah.

523
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,519
This actually explains
a lot.

524
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,473
You did this to us?

525
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
You can undo it.

526
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,240
That is true,
but I think the question is,

527
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,429
um... why would I
want to?

528
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,840
What the hell did
he just do?

529
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,440
He bought himself
some time.

530
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,716
What's happening?

531
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,715
Trouble.

532
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,520
The crazy bastard let
all the other crazy bastards

533
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,400
out of their cages.

534
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:24,896
All right. Get the patients back
in their rooms

535
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,036
and find that book.

536
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,758
Finally, the inmates
are running the asylum.

537
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,270
<i>Not for long!</i>

538
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,153
Fries, fries,
fries, fries.

539
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,919
Come on. Where is it?

540
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,236
Are you OK?

541
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,229
My cryostasis shut off
when the locks did.

542
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,313
I... i need
to be cold.

543
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,836
196 below zero.
196, he said.

544
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,556
How does this thing work?

545
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,256
OK. Maybe you should
just take a step back.

546
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Just get away from me!

547
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,031
Ohh. You cold bitch.

548
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,280
Unh!

549
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:02,281
Aah!

550
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Agh!

551
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,317
No sign of Deegan
or the book.

552
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,679
What the hell
are you supposed to be?

553
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,634
Nicely done. Floor it.

554
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,679
Aah!

555
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,712
Who's this badass?

556
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
Agh.

557
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,031
That's... not Batman.

558
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,552
Kate Kane told you
to get out of Gotham.

559
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,232
You should have
listened to her.

560
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,760
<i>I've been
all over this place,</i>

561
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,394
<i>and I can't find anything.</i>

562
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,956
Guys, I could use
a little backup.

563
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,150
On it.

564
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
<i>On it.</i>

565
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,114
There you are.

566
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,872
Took the words right
out of my mouth.

567
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Slippery.

568
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,189
Listen to me.

569
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,356
Caitlin.

570
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Wait. No, Oliver.

571
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:53,797
Hey. Remember what
happened in central...

572
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,760
Oliver!

573
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:01,721
Oliver!

574
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,280
<i>Oliver's not here.</i>

575
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
In fact...

576
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,354
No one's coming
to save you.

577
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,517
No one's coming
to save you.

578
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,551
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

579
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,989
You left me to die
on Lian Yu.

580
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,353
Unfortunately for you...
heh heh... I didn't.

581
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,880
Does anybody copy?

582
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,875
Because... i think we have
a new problem.

583
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,834
Come on. You can do
better than that.

584
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,520
You're a killer,
a depraved monster

585
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,233
who found a way to
channel his darkness

586
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,232
and pat himself
on the back for it!

587
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,798
You'll never beat me.
Too slow, big heart.

588
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,952
Mama raised you right,
so right,

589
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,832
you couldn't stop me
from killing her.

590
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,273
Your father took
the coward's way out,

591
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,875
and all these years,
you told yourself it was brave,

592
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,550
but he was a coward
just like you.

593
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,950
A failure.

594
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Selfish.

595
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Slow.

596
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,556
Pathetic.

597
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,630
Pathetic.

598
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,600
Who the hell are you?

599
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,790
No. Seriously,
who are you?

600
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,154
Your friends were exposed
to a powerful hallucinogen.

601
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Are you guys
all right?

602
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,280
Define all right.

603
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,552
So how does a book make
people change bodies?

604
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,030
Deegan said he was using
the book to change reality.

605
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,476
Same question.
How does a book change reality?

606
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,176
We'll figure that out when
we get back to Star City.

607
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,317
Guys, we're gonna need
some help with this lock.

608
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,472
Good. Then
you'll be leaving Gotham.

609
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,677
You guys have caused enough
problems for one night.

610
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,480
Hey. Would hitching a ride in the
Batmobile be out of the question?

611
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,398
Get... out.

612
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Sure.

613
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,076
- She really is like Batman.
- Yep.

614
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,556
I don't do
tearful good-byes.

615
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,400
No. I... I just wanted
to wish you luck.

616
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,679
Wherever your
cousin is,

617
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,832
I'm sure he's really
proud of you.

618
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
X-ray vision.

619
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,640
You really do have
a lot of tattoos.

620
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,311
Somehow, I feel like Kara Danvers
doesn't have a single one.

621
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,710
You know, it's such
a shame I have to go

622
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,758
because I feel like we
would make a good team.

623
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,799
World's finest.

624
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,232
Oh. Look who
finally came back.

625
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,016
With what looks like
a fairly infamous book.

626
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,157
A book with
a cryptographic lock on it.

627
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,536
Can you get to work on opening it,
please?

628
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,576
We don't have
a lot of time.

629
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,069
OK. Geek squad,
form up on me!

630
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,119
Not much
of a heartfelt reunion.

631
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,600
She's getting used
to everything.

632
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,480
Do you want me to talk to her as,
you know, you?

633
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,030
I think I'm in enough trouble
with Felicity as it is,

634
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,680
but no offense.

635
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,600
Hey. Can I talk to you
for a minute, then?

636
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,320
- Yeah. What's up?
- I just wanted to see

637
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,396
how you're doing.

638
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,035
I'm compartmentalizing.

639
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,240
I'll fix things
with Felicity later.

640
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,754
I don't mean
with Felicity.

641
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,599
We both saw some stuff
back at arkham.

642
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,837
I saw evil flash.

643
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,156
Eobard Thawne.

644
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,595
I saw Malcolm Merlyn.

645
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,035
- Oh.
- I knew you'd been

646
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
through a lot,
but...

647
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
I don't know, man.
I never realized.

648
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,840
I don't know
how you do it.

649
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
I wouldn't be
able to live

650
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,560
with the Burdens
that you carry.

651
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Yes, you would.

652
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,312
Barry, I always thought
that you had it easy,

653
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,479
everything was just
sunshine and rainbows

654
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,872
and... everybody likes you.

655
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,512
You have real steel
in you, my friend.

656
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,080
You can carry any Burden
thrown your way.

657
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,754
Some unsolicited
advice?

658
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Hmm.

659
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,638
Don't wait to work things
out with Felicity.

660
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,076
Our line of work,
you never know how much time you got.

661
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,273
Not only is the lock
cryptographic...

662
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,416
It's metaphysical.
The readings I'm getting off this thing

663
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,432
are nuts... and, yes,
that's a technical term.

664
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,120
Um, may I speak
with Felicity for a minute?

665
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,074
Sure thing, Barry...
Oliver... Boliver.

666
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,390
Stop helping.

667
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,319
This must be strange
for you.

668
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,670
Oh. What gave you
that idea?

669
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,917
I don't know.
Maybe it's easier for you to hear this

670
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,879
coming from...
Barry Allen.

671
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,880
What a stupid...

672
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:23,881
hear what?

673
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,839
That we're gonna be OK.

674
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,553
People change, Felicity.

675
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,200
It means we're growing.

676
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,993
It means we're
evolving,

677
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,550
except for one thing,

678
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,552
one thing that
will not change...

679
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,312
Is how I feel
about you.

680
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,632
Love is too small
a word...

681
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,833
And no matter who you are

682
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,433
or... or what you become,

683
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,239
no matter who I am

684
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,835
or... or what I become...

685
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,239
You will always be...

686
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,638
you will always be
the love of my life.

687
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,354
People change.

688
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,114
That never will.

689
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,872
Oliver, I...

690
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,080
Jay?

691
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:33,595
- No.
- Oh, my god. Dad?

692
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,837
My name is Barry Allen.

693
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Hello, John.

694
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,556
Do... do I know you?

695
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,840
You're not wearing
your ring.

696
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,753
Things must be
different here.

697
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,276
Barry,
where's there?

698
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,511
My Earth, Earth 90.

699
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,797
I've traveled from there
to warn you.

700
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,470
- Warn us about what?
- His name is mar novu,

701
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,996
but he calls himself
the monitor now.

702
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,871
He's been unleashing
the book of destiny

703
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,953
across the multiverse
to test different Earths.

704
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,270
Test them for what?

705
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,274
A crisis that he
believes is coming.

706
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,793
Novu thinks
the elseworlds created

707
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,111
by the book of destiny
approximates

708
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,433
the collision of realities
that we're facing.

709
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Guys...

710
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,673
We got a situation.

711
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Cisco.

712
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,830
That... that's him
from the vibe.

713
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,149
Mar novu,

714
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,000
you're gonna
stand down.

715
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,075
You're gonna use that book to
help us set reality right.

716
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,840
Well, I certainly
wouldn't have placed it

717
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,678
in Deegan's hands
if that were my intent.

718
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,990
Enough.

719
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,233
You will not do
to this Earth

720
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,834
what you did to mine.

721
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,152
I admire your
persistence, Barry.

722
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,994
He said you were
testing us.

723
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,760
And thus far,

724
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:03,876
I am unimpressed.

725
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,474
<i>A crisis is imminent.</i>

726
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
<i>Someone is coming,</i>

727
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,794
someone far, far more powerful
than myself.

728
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
I mean to prepare.

729
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,991
By giving a nut bar
an all-powerful

730
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,520
reality-rewriting
book?

731
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,276
I am testing universes
to find one, I hope,

732
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,800
strong enough to stand
against him.

733
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,354
You're causing chaos,

734
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,080
and you're blaming
everyone else!

735
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,958
In the hope of finding
the champions

736
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,952
that would save
the multiverse entire.

737
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,954
<i>You are the first of those
I've placed under fire</i>

738
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,318
who have managed to retrieve
the book of destiny...

739
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,318
For all the good
it did you.

740
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,153
Enough of this.
Kara?

741
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,834
Yeah. I'd love to.

742
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,640
You show potential.

743
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,479
Let us see if it's
anything more.

744
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,233
What is he talking
about, Barry?

745
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,312
I offered you godhood,

746
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,040
and you squandered it
on a petty dream.

747
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,760
<i>Do better.</i>

748
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,118
Think bigger.

749
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,235
Ohh.

750
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,230
What the hell?

751
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,718
- Where'd he go?
- What the hell?

752
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,837
He went to give
Deegan the book... Back.

753
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
How do you know?

754
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,518
He did it again.
He rewrote reality.

755
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,280
How far do you think

756
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,961
- the changes go this time?
- I don't know.

757
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,874
- Freeze!
- On the ground!

758
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,076
Now!

759
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,153
Uh... speed us out of here.

760
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,236
I can't.
Can you?

761
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Nope.

762
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,435
Oliver Queen.

763
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,678
I've been waiting
to do this

764
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,917
for a long time.

765
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Unh!

766
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Aah!

767
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,549
Should I follow you? What...

768
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Hey!

769
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,716
There's no place you can run
where I can't find you.

770
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
It's over.

771
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
