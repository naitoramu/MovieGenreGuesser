1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,793
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,280
<i>After 6 months in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,834
<i>I have been released
from prison</i>

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,593
<i>and returned home
with only one goal...</i>

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,796
<i>to save my city,</i>

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,439
<i>but things have changed.</i>

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,512
<i>Instead of operating
outside the law,</i>

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>I am now working
alongside the police.</i>

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,474
<i>I am no longer inmate 4587.</i>

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,110
<i>I am once more
the Green Arrow.</i>

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,429
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,193
<i>Ricardo Diaz
is dead.</i>

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,640
Whoever's been running around
dressed up as the Green Arrow,

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,034
that's your murderer.

15
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,256
Does she have any reason
to blame my family

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,634
for her mother's death?

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,240
Y'all did become
Starling City Royalty

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,416
while she and her mom were left
to struggle in The Glades.

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,035
What our father did to
you was unforgiveable.

20
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,237
I see now
you are different from him.

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,536
You and Oliver Queen
are getting along quite well.

22
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,676
He trusts me now.

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,672
It's time for you
to come home.

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,035
<i>Archer is active.</i>

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,376
I think that's more than a
security system you're working on.

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,616
I think you're on
to something big.

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,120
You're lying about
who you really are.

28
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,556
What makes you think
they will believe

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,359
a word you say,

30
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,159
Black Siren?

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,513
<i>Where are we
supposed to go?</i>

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,990
<i>I don't know.
I'm sorry.</i>

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,151
<i>Sorry?
This is our home, Robert,</i>

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,038
<i>one that you used to
be a part of.</i>

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,634
<i>You don't understand.</i>

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,514
<i>If I let you stay,
she will take everything...</i>

37
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,910
<i>my company,
my money, my children.</i>

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,357
<i>What about our child?</i>

39
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,399
<i>The movers will be here
tomorrow afternoon.</i>

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,193
<i>Tell Emiko I'm sorry.</i>

41
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,712
- Emiko.
- Where are we going, dad?

42
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,918
You and your mom
are going to live

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,277
someplace else,
someplace better.

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,714
But I want to
stay here!

45
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,919
I know you do, kiddo,
but life isn't fair.

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,191
We don't always get
what we want.

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,349
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,839
Dad, please don't leave.

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,029
You OK?

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Are you?

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,880
Where'd you learn that?

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,519
I'll tell you
if you tell me

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,239
where you learned
taekwondo.

54
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,479
I learned taekwondo

55
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,116
from a woman named
Talia in Russia.

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,635
Your past gets
more mysterious every day.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,234
Could say the same
thing about you.

58
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,394
Your turn.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,199
It's complicated.

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,590
I had a good teacher.
He, um,

61
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,115
showed me
how to protect myself.

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,192
He taught you well.

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,356
Nice trick.

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,909
The key is to watch
your opponent

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,716
and not the stick.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,359
What are you
smiling about?

67
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,669
- I kicked your ass.
- Oh, no.

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,114
You most certainly
did not.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,113
Thea and I used to
spar like this.

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,871
She always wanted
a sister.

71
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,154
So did I.

72
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,117
Rematch?

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,913
If you think
you can handle it.

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,352
Oh, come on, Smoak.
You got this.

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,591
You know you can be pregnant
and be ceo of a company

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,478
and a deputized vigilante
by night.

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,031
Women really can
have it all.

78
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,554
I'm talking to myself.

79
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,240
<i>DNA match complete.</i>

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,233
<i>Identity confirmed.
Alena Whitlock.</i>

81
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,754
Well, that is
ingenious.

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,399
Was not expecting
an entrance

83
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,233
or that you knew
my last name.

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,834
- Alena, hi.
- Hi.

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,594
Hi! Oh, it's been so long.
How have you been?

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
When you're
the known associate

87
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,718
of the evil and murder
genius Cayden James,

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,439
good to keep
a low profile,

89
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,239
so I'm working
at tech village.

90
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,551
Oh, no. Oh.
I have been there literally.

91
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,360
I know your pain.
The... the vests.

92
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,750
So, um, how did you
find me, actually?

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,832
It's part of a new project
I have been working on.

94
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,376
It started off as, like,
a home-based security system,

95
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
and now it's turned
into, like,

96
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,633
a DNA-tracking-based
surveillance system.

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,315
- Meet Archer.
- Sorry. So you located me

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,550
using my DNA?

99
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,233
When did you collect
my DNA? Heh.

100
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,630
- I know it's a little creepy.
- It's more than a little,

101
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,513
but it's also impressive.

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
I've been using it for Team Arrow,
but I think

103
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,336
if we scaled it up,
it could be so much more than that.

104
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,096
I mean, we could find missing persons,
we could track terrorists,

105
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,760
we could do crowd control,
we could do anything!

106
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,272
Just, I can't do it
alone.

107
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,119
I mean, whatever
you need, I am game.

108
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,431
I am so done telling
customers to use

109
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,591
the chip in their card when
they insist on swiping.

110
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,911
Great! How does cto of
Smoak Technologies sound?

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh! Oh! Oh!

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,598
Oh! You're not even
gonna ask about benefits?

113
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,736
I don't care
about the benefits

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,070
as long as there's
no crappy vest requirement.

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,277
- I am in!
- No vest. Huge benefit.

116
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,999
Music to my ears.

117
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,352
<i>D.A. Laurel Lance
is at the front door.</i>

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,432
- Allow access.
<i>- Access granted.</i>

119
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,159
<i>It's open.</i>

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,077
- Hey.
- Is your wife around?

121
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,834
No. She went out.
What's up?

122
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,151
Uh, nothing.
I'll just...

123
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,311
I'll come find
Felicity later.

124
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,874
Your bandage is
bleeding through.

125
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,479
Sit down. We'll get
you cleaned up.

126
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,874
Fine.

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,315
- Thank you.
- Sure.

128
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,312
Looks like
an Arrow wound.

129
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,312
Because it is
an Arrow wound.

130
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,278
Where'd it come from?

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,000
Your sister's bow.

132
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,594
- What?
- Look. I don't mean to

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,353
blindside you
with this,

134
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,318
which is why I wanted
to talk to Felicity...

135
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,312
you know, empathy
and all that...

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,717
but your sister is not the
hero you think she is.

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,315
What are you
talking about?

138
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,959
Ben Turner saw her
at slabside

139
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,839
The Night Diaz
was murdered.

140
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,311
It wasn't another inmate
that killed Diaz.

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,120
It was Emiko.

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,520
Heh heh heh.

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,080
That makes no sense.

144
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,311
Well, I figured
you'd say that,

145
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,995
so I did more digging,
and there are no records

146
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,037
of her that exist
past the age of 15,

147
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,634
no fingerprints.

148
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,800
And when I followed her last
night to find out more,

149
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,031
she tried skewering
me with an Arrow.

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,635
OK. I've seen her skills
up close.

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,030
She doesn't miss.

152
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,112
If she wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

153
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,159
Oh. Maybe I should
be thankful, then.

154
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,598
Once upon a time, I actually shot
Roy Harper and Barry Allen.

155
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,637
It was to illustrate
a point.

156
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
My guess is that
her point is

157
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,833
she doesn't want to be
stalked anymore.

158
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,389
Or maybe sister has
brother wrapped

159
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,199
around her
little finger.

160
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,794
You know, the Oliver
I knew, he had

161
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,360
a blind spot
for family,

162
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,159
and I'm guessing
you do, too.

163
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
It's called loyalty.

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,871
I know that's a concept you
don't totally understand.

165
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,475
I have nothing
to gain here.

166
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,119
I am only trying to
do what's right.

167
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,395
Why can you
not see that?

168
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,914
There has to be
more to this,

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
and I will look into it

170
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,994
if you will promise
to stay out of it.

171
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,197
I already wish
I would have.

172
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
Good luck.

173
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,393
If I give this to you,

174
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,997
my family's
safe, right?

175
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,231
I can guarantee it.

176
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,831
If it's all there.

177
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,271
All that we'll need.

178
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,033
I believe we're
done here.

179
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,639
What the hell is that?

180
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,030
Uh!

181
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,717
Help!

182
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,080
Please.

183
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,680
Hey. It's OK.
It's OK.

184
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,240
I got you, I got you.
I got you.

185
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,118
Forget about me.

186
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,634
You need to stop them.

187
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,837
Who? Who? Stop who?

188
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,639
The Ninth Circle.

189
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,116
The Ninth what?

190
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,431
- Circle.
- Dante's a part of it.

191
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,194
Turns out he's not just a banker
for terrorists and cartels.

192
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,976
OK. Lyla and I have been
hunting Dante for months.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,071
Why are we just
hearing this name?

194
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,016
Because The Ninth Circle
is practically invisible.

195
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,776
I mean, I combed the entire
dark web and came up with nada,

196
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,016
but then I remembered
this photo you sent me

197
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,759
from the ghost initiative's
last ride.

198
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,513
Right.
That symbol was on

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,512
all the weapons that
Virgil's goons used.

200
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,536
The symbol also pops up on
artifacts dating all the way back

201
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,120
to 14th-century Italy,
the real Dante's era.

202
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,351
The insignia is mostly
commonly found on ephemera

203
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,716
that is connected to times
of historical upheaval...

204
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,976
the Russian Revolution,
The Colonization of The Americas,

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
the war of roses.

206
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,200
So you're saying Dante
runs a secret society

207
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,680
responsible
for centuries

208
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,154
of worldwide
regime change?

209
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,674
Right,
but if that's true,

210
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,096
The Ninth Circle's
clearly way bigger

211
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,554
than just Dante.

212
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,376
OK. Well, how did you run into
Dante last night, Oliver,

213
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,995
and why didn't you
call for backup?

214
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,357
Laurel came to speak
with you and found me.

215
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,995
Suggested that...

216
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,959
Emiko has been hiding
certain parts of her past

217
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,351
and said that
she killed Diaz.

218
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
She killed Diaz?

219
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,670
Which doesn't mean
she's bad.

220
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,479
I followed Emiko,

221
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,914
and it led me
to Dante.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,496
OK. Well, all we really
know about Emiko

223
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,352
is what she's told us,
which isn't much.

224
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,352
She's a vigilante.
For all we know,

225
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,416
she's gathering intel on The
Ninth Circle to take them down.

226
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,114
Also, why are we taking
Laurel's word about anything?

227
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,475
Hey. Laurel
has changed a lot.

228
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,696
I mean,
she's been a really good friend to me...

229
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,616
not to say that your sister's evil,
but she's changed a lot.

230
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,111
Be that as it may,
The Ninth Circle is clearly a threat,

231
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,976
and we need to follow up
every lead that we have.

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,096
Well, we know that they stole
8 military-grade drones,

233
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,296
which they could literally be
planning to do anything with.

234
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,880
OK. Can you use Archer to
pinpoint Dante's location?

235
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,280
Not without his DNA.

236
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,717
OK. Well, I'll talk to Lyla,
take this new intel back there,

237
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,792
and see if we can use
A.R.G.U.S.'s databases.

238
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,656
Yeah. We should be able
to use SCPD resources, too.

239
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,955
I'll get d
up to speed.

240
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,997
I'm gonna go speak
with my sister.

241
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,754
She deserves a chance
to explain herself.

242
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,753
And i... I will...

243
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,355
I'll be here.

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,074
What is so important that couldn't
be handled over the phone?

245
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
Do you remember
our conversation

246
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,554
about playing
by the rules,

247
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,634
about doing things the right
way is usually the hard way?

248
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,157
Why do I feel
a lecture coming on?

249
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,551
The Halcones Kingpin,
Ramiro Gonzalez,

250
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,233
we had a witness

251
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,391
who was ready to nail him
for criminal conspiracy

252
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,076
until we found out his confession
was coerced by the D.A.

253
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,994
You wanted the city
cleaned up, right?

254
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,434
I'm cleaning.

255
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
You are an officer
of the law.

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,390
You have to play by it.

257
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,473
You know, with Team Arrow
working alongside the SCPD,

258
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,640
this city has a real chance
of turning things around,

259
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,680
and it's never gonna happen
if our D.A. is a criminal.

260
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,434
All of those guys
are guilty.

261
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,910
You'd rather see them
kicked than me

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,071
bend a couple of...
of little rules

263
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
to make sure
their charges stick?

264
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,991
Yes, because if anyone finds
out what you've been up to,

265
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,231
they're all gonna get off
on technicalities,

266
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,152
and you're gonna
get fired.

267
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,119
Fine, but I'm sure
there's a reason

268
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,873
you brought this up
in the first place.

269
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,599
You have a second chance.

270
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,240
SWAT brought in one of Ramirez's
lieutenants last night...

271
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,834
Gustavo Hernandez.

272
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,912
He's looking to deal,
and I want you to put

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,231
that kingpin
behind bars.

274
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,358
Just need you to do it
the right way.

275
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,830
You really know how to take
the fun out of everything.

276
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,478
Uh, we don't have a training
session until next week.

277
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,473
I don't think family
needs a reason to stop by.

278
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,517
Going somewhere?

279
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,919
I, uh,
was just heading out for a bite to eat.

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,437
- What some company?
- Hmm. Not really.

281
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,399
Because you're
meeting someone?

282
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,880
What's with
the interrogation?

283
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,397
That teacher that you
were telling me about,

284
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,949
how long did you
train with him?

285
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,394
Since I was 11.

286
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,914
Where'd you meet?

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,117
It doesn't matter.
It was a long time ago.

288
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,556
Yeah. I mean,
if I was working with a known terrorist,

289
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,838
I'd want to keep
that quiet, too.

290
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,713
What are you
talking about?

291
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,556
I saw you last
night with Dante

292
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,393
outside
Palmer Technologies.

293
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,039
You were following me.

294
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,349
Mm-hmm.

295
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,797
So now you, uh...

296
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,837
you think I'm some
kind of criminal?

297
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,071
Trying to give you the
benefit of the doubt,

298
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,120
but... this guy
Dante is...

299
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,032
he's a monster.

300
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,157
I know who Dante is,

301
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,637
but i...
I didn't back then.

302
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,190
I was 11 when your father
walked out on me and my mother.

303
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,715
He chose your family
over mine,

304
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,359
and he left us
with nothing...

305
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,432
no home, no money.

306
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,077
Dante took me
under his wing,

307
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,992
and he... he trained me.

308
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,311
He taught me
how to survive.

309
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,040
By the time I knew who he really was,
it was too late.

310
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,670
You know, I owed him,
and I still do now.

311
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,592
I can help you.

312
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,239
You have no idea

313
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,676
what kind of power
he holds.

314
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
The organization
he runs...

315
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,152
The Ninth Circle?

316
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,760
Then you know there's
no way out.

317
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,957
On your own,

318
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,679
but if you're being
backed up

319
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,116
by a team...

320
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,159
just, I can...
I can help you,

321
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,516
but you have to
let me.

322
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,035
You can't,
and, trust me,

323
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,077
you will only
make things worse

324
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,719
for the both of us
if you try.

325
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,716
Delivery from
frank bertinelli.

326
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,954
I didn't know
the bertinellis

327
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,271
employed
child labor.

328
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,790
Pays better
than a lemonade stand,

329
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,872
and the cops
don't hassle a kid.

330
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,872
That'll be all.

331
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,070
I'll take my watch back.

332
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,195
Do you know who I am?

333
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,354
Dante. It says
on the package.

334
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,193
Do you know
who I am?

335
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,590
The suspense is
killing me.

336
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,360
- Emiko.
- Well, Emiko,

337
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,716
taking my watch is
a pretty risky move.

338
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,871
Well, I need money,

339
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,000
and it looks like
you have enough.

340
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,111
I earn it.

341
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,433
How'd you do that thing
with the knife?

342
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,115
Pretty simple,
actually.

343
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,474
I can teach you
if you want.

344
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,559
Come back tomorrow.

345
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,752
That was a good lift.

346
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,877
Steal from me again,

347
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,519
and I'll slit your throat.

348
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,832
Good news!

349
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,470
Lyla got a DNA sample from
the dagger used by Dante

350
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,716
to kill Director Bell.

351
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,519
Guess who now has
said sample?

352
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,557
John Diggle,
you give the best gifts.

353
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,960
Now that we have
Dante's DNA,

354
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,136
will Archer be
able to find him?

355
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,656
Well, with all the money I'm spending
on this program, that is the hope.

356
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,096
How's Emiko?
Did you find anything more

357
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,077
- about her being...
- Being on the wrong side.

358
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,391
She admitted
to being in very deep

359
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,437
with Dante
and The Ninth Circle.

360
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,216
Sounds like she could be
in some real trouble.

361
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,469
Boom. I got him.

362
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,153
Looks like he's
at the Star City branch

363
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
of szrek chemicals.

364
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
If we surprise
Dante now,

365
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,456
we could still
take him down.

366
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,358
And get my sister
out of trouble.

367
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,715
Let's suit up.

368
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,195
Hey, Jerry.
We still on for beers tonight?

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,195
Maybe we should
try Nelson's.

370
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,192
Better service.

371
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,792
I'm afraid Jerry's
not gonna make it.

372
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,679
Please don't kill me.

373
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Of course not.

374
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,593
Unh!

375
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,840
Those.

376
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,277
- You told him we were here!
- I didn't.

377
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,315
Your allegiance
has shifted.

378
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,195
Now!

379
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,397
D, go!
We got you covered.

380
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Agh!

381
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,878
Let's get out of here.

382
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Grab her.

383
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,473
Let me go!

384
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,315
- You OK?
- Uh-huh.

385
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,716
I shouldn't be here.
Dante will find me.

386
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,696
It's just a matter of time,
and you will all be targets.

387
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,235
Yeah? Well, it won't
be the first time.

388
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,549
Think about it
like this.

389
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,677
It'll be a hell of a lot
easier to stop Dante

390
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,229
with all of us working
together than you by yourself.

391
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,789
OK, as long as I get to
be the one who takes him down.

392
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,314
That sounds fair to me.

393
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,278
Well, yeah, except
there's just one problem.

394
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,829
Archer just crashed,
which means I lost Dante's location.

395
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,416
Fine. We'll just have to
find Dante the old-fashioned way.

396
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,999
Easier said
than done.

397
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,992
Now that he knows I'm
working with you,

398
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,976
we should consider all Ninth
Circle locations burned.

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,354
But that op we just
interrupted,

400
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,816
I mean, Dante didn't get
what he was looking for.

401
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,150
You must know what he
was after.

402
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,913
Enriched uranium.

403
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,713
I told you he was
dangerous.

404
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,456
We need to figure
out where else in the city

405
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,776
he can get his hands
on that uranium.

406
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,269
Yeah. I'm on it.
Archer may have crashed,

407
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,431
but computers will
never replace people.

408
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,936
Do you have any idea what
he was planning on doing

409
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,235
with the drones
and uranium?

410
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,390
I wish I had
more intel,

411
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,278
but it was always on
a need-to-know basis.

412
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,829
That's how the
Ninth Circle works.

413
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,991
- Hey. You hurt?
- Not badly.

414
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,992
- You guys have some ice?
- Yeah.

415
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
This could not
be worse timing,

416
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,114
but I have to run
to the SCPD.

417
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Go ahead, captain.
We'll handle it from here.

418
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,634
Hey. What's wrong?

419
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,150
Just be careful
with her, Oliver.

420
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,435
OK. I will.

421
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,239
Hey, guys.
Think I got something.

422
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,016
- That was fast.
- One point for the humans.

423
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,032
If Emiko is right
and he's after uranium,

424
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,476
there's only two places
in Star City that have it...

425
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,313
dunkirk power
and global energy.

426
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,153
Sounds like a divide
and conquer situation.

427
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,993
My thoughts exactly.

428
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,200
So are you just gonna
not ask me about it?

429
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,136
You have nothing
to say about the fact

430
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,096
that I've been secretly
working for The Ninth Circle?

431
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,238
I know you well enough
not to pry,

432
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,198
and you did try to keep
me out of your mission

433
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,396
when we first met.

434
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,836
I didn't want you to
get mixed up with them,

435
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,277
but i... I should have
told you the truth

436
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,556
so you'd know what you
were really getting into

437
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,552
working with me.

438
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,633
I bet you wish
you'd listened

439
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,359
when I told you
to stay away.

440
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,354
If you think I regret teaming up with you,
I don't.

441
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,353
We're still partners,
Emiko,

442
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,999
no matter who we're
up against.

443
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,029
You haven't practiced.

444
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,952
This is much harder
than last week.

445
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,032
No. You're just
not prepared.

446
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,316
I was busy. I was
working on something.

447
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,711
Oh, yes. Your plan
to impress daddy.

448
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,075
Being a father means
more than just blood.

449
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,437
I know, but he is
still my father.

450
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,194
So you would choose
a man who abandoned you

451
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,873
over The Ninth Circle?

452
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,515
Why can't I
have both?

453
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,594
The Ninth Circle is not
a place of split loyalties.

454
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,593
Once you join,
it is a lifetime commitment.

455
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,559
There is nothing else.

456
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,836
I can't give up
on my family.

457
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,879
The Ninth Circle is
your family now...

458
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,840
And that is
their gift to you.

459
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,760
You really want a deal
for this smug bastard?

460
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,240
Are you sure?

461
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,913
Bigger picture,
Laurel.

462
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,834
Mr. Hernandez,
do you know who I am?

463
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,116
You're the D.A. who
used to be a vigilante.

464
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,316
Yeah, I know you.

465
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,915
Good, because I know
you, too...

466
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,714
drug trafficking,
embezzlement, manslaughter.

467
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,075
Murder?

468
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,992
So this is the part where
you offer me a deal

469
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,673
to make it all
go away, right?

470
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,198
Hmm. If it were up to me,
I'd let you rot or worse,

471
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,398
but, luckily for you,
it's your boss who we're after...

472
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,517
Ramiro Gonzalez.

473
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,791
And you think that a plea
deal's enough to flip me?

474
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,917
Hey. I've got
enough evidence here

475
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,320
to convict you
of 3 felonies,

476
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,517
one using
a deadly weapon,

477
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,512
and that was in a day.

478
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,434
Imagine what I could do
in a week.

479
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,639
You know, your dad thought he
could convict me, too, right?

480
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,359
Must be
a family defect.

481
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,831
I would be really
careful if I were you

482
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,877
because we're not a family
that plays very nice.

483
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,872
How's that going
for you?

484
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,710
Captain Lance...
he's dead now, isn't he?

485
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,713
Say his name one more
time, and you will be, too.

486
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,629
Aw. Girl's got a soft spot for daddy.
Aw.

487
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,400
That's enough,
D.A. Lance.

488
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,199
We're done here.

489
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,393
Global energy
was a bust.

490
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,994
No sign of Dante
or the uranium.

491
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,434
Ah. You still
came back looking

492
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,749
like a prizefighter,
though.

493
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,230
We ran into a couple
thugs on the way back.

494
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,656
Ooh. Cute.
A little brother-sister

495
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,830
crime-fighting duo time.

496
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,216
- I like it.
- Any word from John and Rene?

497
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,516
They struck out,
too.

498
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,016
Global energy
and dunkirk power are

499
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,350
the only two spots in Star City
that manufacture uranium.

500
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,432
- Archer's still not working.
- Right.

501
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,336
I'm just about to go down into the deepest,
darkest,

502
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,616
most dungeony part
of this bunker

503
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,074
and give it
a full system reboot.

504
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,496
Then hopefully then, you know,
Archer can be back online,

505
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,954
we can find Dante,
and all my dreams

506
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,680
of Smoak Tech saving the
world don't have to die.

507
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,317
I'm gonna clean
this up.

508
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,795
Think I found
the problem.

509
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,837
Some kind of jammer.

510
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,478
Wonder how that
got there.

511
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,438
So you were never
under duress.

512
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,113
Sorry to
disappoint you,

513
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,759
but that's what family
does, right?

514
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,176
This is the reason that
Archer isn't working?

515
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,320
I couldn't let you and your
team get in the way again.

516
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,352
We don't give up
that easily.

517
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,717
You've been lying
this entire time,

518
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,280
everything
about our father,

519
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,834
your debt to Dante?

520
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,717
It was all true,
but I never needed you

521
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,439
to put me back together.

522
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,590
I just knew you'd try.

523
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,149
Can't resist playing
the hero, can you?

524
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,754
Unh!

525
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,672
You went looking
for a family,

526
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,797
and you chose
The Ninth Circle?

527
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,519
Better than living
as a Queen.

528
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,474
Always watch
your opponent.

529
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,756
You don't have to be
a part of this.

530
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,115
You have a choice!

531
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I've made it!

532
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,710
Bye, brother.

533
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,319
I was married
to a junkie.

534
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,392
You'd think I'd know when
someone was lying to me.

535
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,136
At least now we know what
side Emiko's really on.

536
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,631
It doesn't matter.
The... The Ninth Circle are still out there,

537
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,274
and they are a threat.

538
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,856
You can take a minute to
process this if you need to.

539
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,712
I need to know
where she is.

540
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,616
How soon can you have
Archer back up and running?

541
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,869
Not as soon
as I would like.

542
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,896
Emiko's little device didn't
just jam up the system.

543
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,456
It wiped the entire memory card,
which means

544
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,597
I have to rebuild the
entire infrastructure.

545
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,856
Looks like we have
another problem.

546
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,520
There's been a break-In at the waste
treatment site at orchard bay.

547
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,296
I thought the only spots
that manufactured uranium

548
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,993
were the two sites
we just canvassed.

549
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,176
Well, that's true,
but how much do you want to bet

550
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,556
that Dante and his pals aren't
actually after uranium?

551
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,393
- More of Emiko's lies.
- What'd they get?

552
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,016
All the ingredients
to make a big batch

553
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
of sarin gas.

554
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,576
That plus the drones
that they just stole

555
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,193
makes one hell
of a murder party.

556
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,576
We have to know where
The Ninth Circle

557
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,856
is planning on
sending these drones.

558
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,714
- Oliver, we're on it.
- You might want to take 5.

559
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,115
I'm going to
Emiko's hideout,

560
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,398
see if she left behind
a clue or something.

561
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,296
Yeah, or you could
do exactly the opposite

562
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,152
of what your wife
recommends.

563
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,038
I'll go with him.

564
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,594
Are you here to give
me another lecture or...

565
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,435
The Halcones Lieutenant,
Gustavo Hernandez,

566
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,480
was found dead
an hour ago.

567
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,836
Really?

568
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,196
Am I supposed to be sad
about that or something?

569
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,760
Well,
we had him in custody to prevent that.

570
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,594
That is, of course, until your office
said we had to turn him loose.

571
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,239
Well, he made bail.

572
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,296
You're the one that said I had
to do things the right way,

573
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,800
so I let him loose,

574
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,475
and here we are back
to square one.

575
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,994
Well, actually, we're not.

576
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,639
Hernandez's death

577
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,296
spooked one of Gonzalez's
other lieutenants,

578
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,597
and, uh, he's
gonna testify.

579
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,399
Isn't that convenient?

580
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,229
You think I did this.

581
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,874
I'm not exactly
hearing a denial.

582
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,156
I shouldn't have
to give you one.

583
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,999
I think I've done
more than enough

584
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,437
to have earned the benefit
of the doubt from you.

585
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,558
I saw how you looked
at that man,

586
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,077
and it was the same look
that you gave Vinnie

587
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,550
right before you
executed him.

588
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,470
I have busted my ass
being a good D.A.,

589
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,914
trying to play
by the rules,

590
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,195
but no matter
what I do, you

591
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,476
always just see me
as the Black Siren.

592
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,312
You're right.
You're right,

593
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,074
and I am sorry,
but I don't know

594
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,230
who you really
are, Laurel.

595
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,518
I don't, and I don't think
that you do either.

596
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,111
I think that's what
scares me the most.

597
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,270
Didn't hurt you
too bad back there, did I?

598
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,115
No. It was a convincing
performance.

599
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,032
Did you, uh,
make any progress on who hired

600
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,794
Andrew Thorn... Ton?

601
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,714
You know I'm a man
of my word.

602
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,513
Once you've found and taken
care of your mother's killer,

603
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,752
you can go back to focusing
on the mission.

604
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,433
A deal is a deal.

605
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,552
This is really impressive.

606
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,120
Did you come up
with this yourself?

607
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,436
Yeah, I did.

608
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,592
Um, and Queen materials,
inc., could be profitable

609
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,592
in as little as 6 months.

610
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,957
If you look at page 7,
after an initial startup fee,

611
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,555
its projected
growth rate is at 14%.

612
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,951
I wish Oliver showed this kind
of interest in the business.

613
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,919
I inherited your
business sense.

614
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,072
Let me start Queen materials,
and I'll show you.

615
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,149
Well, i... I can't
approve this.

616
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,993
Why not?

617
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,549
Queen consolidated
is for Oliver.

618
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,632
He's going to inherit it,

619
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,670
and if anyone were to find out
that you're my daughter...

620
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,195
I need this.

621
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,794
Otherwise, I am
gonna have to find

622
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,234
the money
somewhere else,

623
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,789
and I need it
to help mom,

624
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,315
- something you never did.
- Emiko.

625
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,278
Do you ever even
think about us?

626
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,874
All the time,

627
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,872
and I wish things
were different.

628
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,275
I really do.

629
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,397
Since the day
you left,

630
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,040
I kept holding out,
thinking

631
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,600
one day you'd do
the right thing

632
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,319
and become the
father I deserved.

633
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,914
It's never gonna
happen, is it?

634
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,640
I have to go.

635
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,872
I have a trip planned
to China

636
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,838
on the <i>Queen's Gambit.</i>

637
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,678
And I'm sorry.

638
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,673
Is there something else you'd
like to talk to me about?

639
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,957
No. Have
a good trip.

640
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,878
You want to talk?

641
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,160
Not even to the guy
who found out

642
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,630
his long lost sibling
was secretly

643
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,995
an evil double agent?

644
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,800
Being reminded that
this has happened before

645
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,351
is not really
making things better.

646
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,031
I get that,
but I also know

647
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,713
that despite what
Emiko's done,

648
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,110
you're not quite ready
to give up on her.

649
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,476
That obvious, huh?

650
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,280
Only to someone
who knows you

651
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,955
and who's been there.

652
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,875
All I wanted was to bring
Andy back over to the light.

653
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,715
I don't have to remind you what
having that blind spot cost us.

654
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,519
No, you don't.

655
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,877
But please, John,
trust me when I tell you

656
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,510
that I am seeing Emiko more
clearly than I ever have.

657
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,896
Oliver, you're still
trying to save her.

658
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,037
John, my family
is to blame

659
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,440
for her current
situation.

660
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,433
My...
my father a-abandoned her and her mother.

661
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,319
She was 11!

662
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,312
She was 11 years old,

663
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,232
and no one's gonna
convince me that...

664
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,154
that her life wouldn't
be different now

665
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,594
if that had
never happened.

666
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,956
Andy tried to convince me
that I was the reason

667
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,077
for his bad choices, too.

668
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,550
He made me feel so guilty
that I was willing

669
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,876
to trust him again
even after knowing

670
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,952
he worked for
Damien darhk.

671
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,396
I held out hope, Oliver,
so much hope

672
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,036
that I put you,
my family,

673
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,079
my team at risk.

674
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,755
John, if I abandon
her now...

675
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,311
I'm no better
than my father.

676
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,676
If I can help
redeem her,

677
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,994
selfishly I feel like i...
I help redeem my family just...

678
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,071
A little.

679
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,352
Felicity got a hit
on The Ninth Circle.

680
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,000
Drones are at an abandoned
airfield north of the city.

681
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
And Emiko?

682
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,992
She's there.

683
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,196
Let's get the team.
Let's go.

684
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,752
All right. They're
still prepping the drones.

685
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,080
Good news is
we're not too late.

686
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,152
Bad news is
we're outnumbered 5 to 1.

687
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,754
Those are
my kind of odds.

688
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,718
- Got eyes on Dante.
- And Emiko.

689
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,440
Once the drones
are primed,

690
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,352
we can begin
the Demonstration.

691
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,114
Eight stolen drones,
which means 8 potential targets,

692
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,998
and each one runs
on a separate signal.

693
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,056
It's gonna take some time to
hack into the guidance system.

694
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,696
Oliver, that means that
you need to stop those things

695
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,040
before they take off.

696
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,256
You draw them out,
I'll get the drones.

697
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Copy that.

698
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,953
Let's go!

699
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,156
Unh!

700
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,153
It's your brother.

701
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,873
I'll deal with him.

702
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,235
Pack up
the Demonstration.

703
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,277
No! The Demonstration
goes as planned.

704
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,272
Protect the drones.

705
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
Unh!

706
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,479
Dante!

707
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,880
Drive.

708
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,036
Damn it!

709
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,273
Emiko.

710
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,834
Get out of here.

711
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,080
Bad news, guys.
Those drones are airborne,

712
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,776
which means you need
to incinerate them mid-air

713
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,096
or else that's a lot of sarin
gas raining down on the city.

714
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,750
Overwatch, it would be very helpful
if I could see them.

715
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,356
OK. I'm working
on decloaking them now.

716
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,590
I'm in.

717
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,696
<i>There's still
one drone left.</i>

718
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,712
I'm working on it.

719
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,474
Emiko, it's not
too late.

720
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,719
Whatever you owe
Dante...

721
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,793
I owe Dante everything.

722
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,758
Dante taught me how
to take care of myself,

723
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,674
to cut the ties that bind us,
that hold us back,

724
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,789
which is why it's time
for us to say good-bye...

725
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,394
Brother!

726
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,630
Kill him!

727
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,312
Please tell me you got
that last drone.

728
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,677
By the time I locked on,
the gas had already been deployed.

729
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,551
<i>Sorry, Oliver.</i>

730
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,076
- How many casualties?
- None.

731
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,271
The target was an
abandoned building.

732
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,416
What about
the other targets?

733
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,874
Well, that's the even
weirder thing.

734
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,156
All of the other buildings
targeted were also empty.

735
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,376
Who goes to the trouble
of bombing empty buildings?

736
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,959
Seemed like some
sort of weapons test.

737
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,856
Well, imagine what would happen
if all the drones worked

738
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,314
instead of just one.

739
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,720
They'd be able to take out
multiple targets simultaneously.

740
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,936
If we couldn't stop
this test,

741
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,395
how are we gonna
stop the real thing?

742
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,416
<i>Reacting
to the shocking allegations</i>

743
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,397
<i>about district attorney
Laurel Lance,</i>

744
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,230
<i>new photos show her with
notorious criminal Ricardo Diaz.</i>

745
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,152
<i>Could the city's
highest prosecutor</i>

746
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,835
<i>actually be
a wanted criminal herself?</i>

747
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,072
Looks like
you've got a problem.

748
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,920
- You.
- Knocked off that Halcone?

749
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,673
I did.

750
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,116
Media's gonna have
a field day.

751
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,317
- You're a psycho.
- And you make me sad,

752
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,040
trying so hard to
become someone you're not,

753
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
and for what?

754
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,638
So that the city will take
you seriously as a hero.

755
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,197
That is almost as ridiculous
as you wanting to be one.

756
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,035
Get the hell out
of my office. Now!

757
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,079
I thought I was punishing
you for following me.

758
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,478
Maybe I just set
you free.

759
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,280
Oh, hey. Good.
You're still here.

760
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,319
I'm sorry.
It's been a day.

761
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,471
I assume that's
always the case.

762
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
Honestly, going over
Archer has made me happier

763
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,358
than I've been in months.

764
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,113
The algorithms you
programmed are like

765
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,760
this beautifully composed
rondo finale.

766
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,712
A rondo what, now?

767
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,832
Not into opera.
Got it.

768
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,513
Hey. So question
for version two.

769
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,399
- Mm-hmm?
- What happens when we

770
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,279
don't have the DNA of the
person that we are looking for?

771
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,717
- What do we do then?
- Well, that's a little trickier.

772
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,474
We could reprogram
the algorithm to highlight

773
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,631
any individuals whose DNA
we don't have,

774
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,599
but unless we hack into a
medical or criminal database

775
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,320
and collect all of
their DNA profiles first,

776
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,296
all we'd really be doing
is taking a couple pieces

777
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,391
of straw out of the haystack
we're looking in.

778
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,551
Ah. Guess we'd better
get to work then.

779
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,915
OK.

780
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,554
Felicity couldn't find her,
but you think you can, huh?

781
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,518
I just... I don't
want to give up.

782
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,194
Still trying
to redeem her?

783
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,318
Trying to stop her

784
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,953
before it's
too late.

785
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,350
You disobeyed
a direct order.

786
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,879
I gave you
that dagger.

787
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,114
The weapons test failed

788
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,680
because of your
brother's involvement.

789
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,991
Any more mistakes,
and the rest of The Ninth Circle

790
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,309
will mutiny.

791
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,517
- I am their leader.
- Then lead.

792
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,274
Where is your focus
at this critical time?

793
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,240
The family you swore to give up
to be part of The Ninth Circle.

794
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,073
Your absence
has been noted.

795
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,991
Thanks to my time
with Oliver,

796
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,232
I found something
even better.

797
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,192
The Archer Program,

798
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,916
cutting-edge
surveillance technology.

799
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,390
We can't stake our
future on technology

800
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,392
we haven't
even seen.

801
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,519
I need you
to trust my vision,

802
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,399
OK, trust that you
have taught me well,

803
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,315
but if you question
my authority again,

804
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,515
I'll kill you.
