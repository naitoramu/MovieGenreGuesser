1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,510
Okay, this is insane.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,470
We need more Compound V!

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,098
-Absolutely.
-We need more Supes!

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,725
CROWD (chanting):
More Supes! More Supes!

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,018
More Supes! More Supes!
More Supes!

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,270
More Supes! More Supes!

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,354
Come with me.

8
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,148
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,233
BUTCHER:
But on the bright side,

10
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,651
I'm sleeping in a basement

11
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,154
beneath a pawnshop
in East Flatbush.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,697
We never wanted that for you.

13
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,657
HOMELANDER: We all just have
Ryan's best interests at heart.

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,783
I want us to be a family.

15
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,368
RYAN: They just flew me up
and showed me.

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,454
This house is fake, the
neighbors are fake, you're fake.

17
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,414
No, Ryan!

18
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,874
You have five minutes
to make your opening...

19
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,543
(screaming)

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,974
SHERIFF FLANAGAN:
There's a supervillain
on your school campus.

21
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,934
-(screaming)
-You hear the calls
of distress.

22
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,103
-You witness a violent display
of superpowers.
-(electricity buzzing)

23
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,229
What do you do?

24
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,106
I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,

25
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,776
and I'm here with Homelander
to talk about school safety.

26
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,320
On the first report
of an active supervillain,

27
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,864
a hero will immediately
rush to your campus.

28
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,241
But to stay alive
in the moment, remember,

29
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,453
stay calm and follow the law.

30
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,122
Lock all doors and windows.

31
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,835
Arm yourselves.

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,505
Your teacher should have
an authorized firearm.

33
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,718
But use whatever you can.

34
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,223
And wait for a hero.

35
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,311
-(screaming in distance)
-FLANAGAN: Unfortunately,

36
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,063
the possibility
that you will experience

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,857
a supervillain attack grows
more likely every day.

38
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,360
But by having an action plan,
you can dramatically increase

39
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,861
your chances of survival.

40
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:54,114
And survival is all
that matters.

41
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,784
(TV playing indistinctly)

42
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,954
-Jody, where's my flag pin?
-How should I know?

43
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,331
Well, I can't go to this thing
without a flag pin.

44
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,917
Bob, before he makes
any decisions,

45
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,418
-just let me talk to him.
-One,

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,170
the president doesn't like you.

47
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,214
He used the word "standoffish."

48
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:12,258
And, two, he's decided.

49
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,301
He's declaring
a national emergency,

50
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,678
bypassing the FDA,

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,722
and authorizing Compound V
for use by law enforcement

52
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,474
-and first responders.
-NEUMAN: Wait, Robert.

53
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,601
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I wish I were.

54
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,895
Doses are going
for five million a pop.

55
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,522
Pentagon's got a big order in,

56
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,607
and ICE is next in line.

57
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,984
You can't release V
into the mainstream.

58
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,070
We're talking an avalanche
of Supes; it's suicide.

59
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,698
In one hour, I will be standing
at the memorial service

60
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,450
for the fallen heroes
of the House attack,

61
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,952
with my flag pin,

62
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,872
giving my thoughts and prayers,
and pledging

63
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,790
to keep America safe.

64
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,084
The best way to do that
is with Compound V.

65
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,878
NEUMAN:
Yeah, we know.
We were there. Remember?

66
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,796
Covered in
my chief of staff's brains.

67
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,923
Look, there was no terrorist.
It was Vought.

68
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,009
It's a fucking coup.

69
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,220
-A bunch of their guys
died, too.
-To cover their own tracks.

70
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,141
For the record,
I agree with you.

71
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,684
And I hate this.

72
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,020
But you've got no proof.

73
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,688
Folks are scared.

74
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,274
If Vought took a shit
in the middle of Fifth Avenue,

75
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,525
they'd throw
a ticker-tape parade.

76
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:15,029
-Here's what we do have, Bob.
-Oh, let me guess.

77
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,822
A tape of me fucking
my kids' nanny

78
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,324
at her daughter's quinceañera?

79
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,285
Release it. Please.
I'm begging you.

80
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,039
A plum gig at Fox, and this
shithole in my rearview?

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,125
-Sounds dreamy.
-Okay, what if we got
hard proof? A witness.

82
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,251
Anything.

83
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,587
SINGER: If you could get
Jesus Christ himself,

84
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,840
or maybe Homelander
in front of a camera, sure.

85
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,842
I really am sorry.

You'll be okay.

-Okay,

92
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,135
drive straight to Gen's

00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,113
you need a new one.

I'm not gonna wear it.

I don't care if you wear it.
I just want you to have it.

00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,670
I love you.

104
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,380
I love you, too.

-What's going on?
-They've lost their minds.

109
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,105
The RPG releases an
electromagnetic pulse on impact.

110
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,941
-Should cut through Stormfront's
plasma bolts.
-How sure are you?

111
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,276
It's a guesstimate.

112
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,445
So that's Stormfront.

113
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,697
And thanks to Starlight,
we know that Noir

114
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,032
needs only a fuckin' tree nut.

115
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,116
How about A-Train?

116
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,617
Got enough epinephrine here
to blow up

117

that motherfucker's heart.

118
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,370
Hey, we can't just
kill everyone.

119
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,123
That is exactly what
we're gonna do.

120
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,207
Listen, you heard Mallory.

121
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,959
She said all we need
is another witness.

122
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,711
Wile E. Coyote.

123
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,172
Always chases Roadrunner,

124
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,841
always with an elaborate plan,
always fails.

125
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,302
You know, I always say,
"Why do this, Coyote?

126
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,889
All you need is an AR-15,
and 'meep-meep' no more."

127
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,348
BUTCHER:
Exactly. See?

128
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,851
We're just gonna shoot
Roadrunner in the fucking head.

129
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,854
That won't stop Vought.
That-that won't stop Compound V.

130
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,189
If you kill these Supes,

131
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,940
then Vought's just gonna
make a thousand more.

132
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,526
-Yeah, and we're gonna top
those cunts, too.
-Great.

133
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,780
So that's settled. We're just
supervillains now, huh?

134
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,114
Vought attacked
the country, Hughie.

135
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,365
Fuck 'em all.

136
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,620
What if I testify?

137
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,164
Escaped convicts don't have
a ton of credibility.

138
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,586
No, but maybe I know
someone who does.

139
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,797
Give us the day.

140
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,383
Hughie?

141
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,803
See you later.

142
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,889
Officials are still trying
to determine the perpetrator

143
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,266
of the capital attack, the
Department of Homeland Security

144
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,478
has issued a crimson
terror alert.

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,939
In Washington,
all government buildings...

146
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,566
-How's Noir?
-Unresponsive.

147
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,110
They don't think
there's brain damage,

148
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,028
but apparently it's hard
to tell.

149
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,280
So, Noir's a vegetable,

150
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,865
Lamplighter's
a charcoal briquette,

151
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,742
Starlight's in the breeze
somewhere, and you're,

152
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,410
-what, fine with it?
-Yes.

153
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,621
Because none of that matters
anymore because of this.

154
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,791
So far, no terrorist group has
claimed responsibility.

155
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,918
(exhales sharply)
All right, so,

156
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,253
you didn't do this.

157
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,797
I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.

158
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,966
-But no, it wasn't me.
-Right.

159
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,927
And there's no supervillains

00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,587
I'm sorry, okay?

322
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,213
I have no right
to ask you to help me

323
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,632
after what I said to you, but...

324
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,968
Look, don't you worry,
all right?

325
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,220
I will find your son.

326
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,602
Thank you.

327
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,526
Fuck off, you lot.

328
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,823
(phone ringing)

329
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,367
EDGAR:
What is it, Samantha?

330
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,661
SAMANTHA (over phone):
Mr. Edgar, normally,

331
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,287
I wouldn't put this through,
but the man says

332
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,206
it's life or death,
and you'd know him.

333
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,666
What's his name?

334
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,209
William Butcher.

335
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,879
Hi, hi.

336
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,673
We've been having
a super fun time in here.

337
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,467
I've just been googling all
the names of the cats in Cats.

338
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,761
Can you believe Ryan
has never seen Cats?

339
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,596
What happened to your hair?

340
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,264
-Oh, nothing. (mutters)
-HOMELANDER: Hey, buddy.

341
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,683
Sorry we had to leave you
all alone.

342
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,644
Dad's work can sometimes
get pretty crazy.

343
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,479
-(chuckles)
-ASHLEY: He hasn't been alone.

344
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,898
I've been here. I got him
all these dipping sauces.

345
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,275
You didn't want to play
Vought Tournament of Heroes?

346
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,527
(whispers):
I'm the main guy.

347
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,779
I was working on my states.

348
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,074
-Uh, states?
-Well, yeah, I write down
all 50 states

349
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,452
as fast as I can
in either alphabetical order

350
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,079
or geographical order.

351
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,164
You're giving yourself homework?

352
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,834
Well, Mom says that learning
is a gift, so...

353
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,837
Mm-hmm. That mom of yours,

354
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,965
she sure does have
some cute little sayings.

355
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,594
Do you think maybe
I could call her?

356
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,930
Uh...
(exhales)

357
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,894
Hey, Ryan.

358
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,146
Ugh.

359
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,942
I get it. I would feel lonely,
too, if I was cooped up

360
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,821
all day by myself
in this West Elm Death Star.

361
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,658
-Mm-hmm.
-STORMFRONT: How about

362
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,660
we take a field trip?

363
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,495
What do you say, Dad?

364
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,874
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to Planet Vought.

365
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,001
Have a super day.

366
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,169
(children shouting)

367
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,837
(upbeat music playing)

368
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,006
ANNOUNCER: Let's give
a warm hero's welcome

369
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,424
to Kashden,
who's turning five today.

370
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,009
Welcome to Planet Vought.

371
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,469
Would you like to try our new

372
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,638
Brave Maeve
Rainbow Veggie Burger?

373
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,599
Holy shit.

374
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,647
HOMELANDER:
There you go, Maestro.

375
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,194
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

376
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,196
HOMELANDER:
(chuckles) Hey.

377
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,615
Wait until you try the Big Homey
with bacon.

378
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,450
It's so good.

379
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,286
And-and the, uh,
and the Mocha Noir Shake?

380
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,289
-It's amazing. And it won't be
lumpy like your mom's.
-(chuckles)

381
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,665
FAN:
Homelander?

382
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,292
(chuckles):
Hey.

383
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,837
-Can I get a selfie?
-Ask the boss.

384
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,464
(chuckles)
Kidding. Of course you can.

385
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,217
-Of course you can.
-Stormfront? I-I love you.

386
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,968
-Can I get a self-- a selfie?
-Oh, sure.

387
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,386
STORMFRONT:
One at a time.

388
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,763
-Homelander.
-STORMFRONT: Kids first.

389
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:17,889
FAN 2:
I'm a huge fan.

390
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,349
-Can I get a picture?
-FAN 3: It's Homelander!

391
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,184
-HOMELANDER: All right. Hey!
-FAN 4: I love you! Homelander!

392
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,186
-Homelander!
-HOMELANDER: Hey, guys...

393
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,979
(crowd clamoring)

394
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,815
(overlapping chatter echoing)

395
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,317
RYAN:
I want to go home.

396
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,611
(clamoring continues)

397
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,946
(whimpering)

398
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,490
Hey. You okay?

399
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,866
I want my mom.

400
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,286
Okay, I got you. I got you.

401
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,497
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.

402
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,625
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

403
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,837
Stay back, please. Please,
please, please. Just stay back.

404
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,089
Stay back. Thank you.

405
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,803
-HUGHIE: New bling?
-STARLIGHT: Mm-hmm.

406
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,222
Donna got it for me.

407
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,516
Pretty sure she got it
at Duane Reade.

408
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,352
(chuckles)

409
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,563
Oh, gosh. Moms.

410
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:11,234
The gift that keeps
on giving, forever.

411
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,488
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

412
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,991
Wh-- No, it's-it's fine.

413
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,410
No, no. I'm an asshole
for bitching about my mom

414
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,287
when yours is...

415
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,082
My mom's not dead.

416
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,917
She's not?

417
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,086
Oh, it's just, you never
mentioned her, so...

418
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,255
She left when I was six.

419
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,884
Oh, wow. Shit.

420
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,552
I'm really sorry.

421
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:42,974
That's where Billy Joel
comes from.

422
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,643
She and I, we used to have
these dance parties.

423
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,062
She was, she was fun.

424
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,232
She made awesome Seven costumes
for Halloween.

425
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:57,196
And, uh, then one day, she just
left and never called again.

426
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,908
Not even a card.

427
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,910
You know, it was like
some silent alarm went off

428
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,579
and she was like, "Well...

429
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,457
fuck them, time to go."

430
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,792
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

431
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,711
What would you call it?

432
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,343
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

433
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:22,013
no matter how bad it gets.

434
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,307
'Cause I...

435
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,684
I-I don't want to be like her.

436
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,649
That's kind of clingy
and pathetic, isn't it?

437
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,734
No. No.

438
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,653
It isn't.

439
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,279
At all.

440
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,408
-What's up, shitbirds?
-(both screaming)

441
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,952
-STARLIGHT: Jesus Christ!
-(horn blaring)

442
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,078
(tires screech)

443
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,415
(panting) What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

444
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,250
-How did you find us?!
-Please.

445
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,961
I can cover the boroughs in,
like, three hours.

446
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,212
I went looking, that's all.

447
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,214
I'm surprised your heart
can take it.

448
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,466
My heart is just fine. Take
a step closer and I'll show you.

449
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,801
HUGHIE:
Hey, I saved your life,

450
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,011
asshole. And now
you're coming after us?

451
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,768
We're even now, bitch.

452
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,692
Holy shit!

453
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,610
Is this true?

454
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,488
-Everything makes a little more
sense now, doesn't it?
-Where did you get this?

455
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,699
I didn't get it. Okay?
I was never here.

456
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,951
You got that shit on your own.
Yeah?

457
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,786
But wh-- why-why
are you doing this?

458
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,121
'Cause I want back in.

459
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,623
So, I need her gone.

460
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,834
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

461
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,419
(both shudder)

462
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,446
Would you ask Mario
if he could whip up

463
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,240
some of those Gruyère puffs?

464
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,659
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

465
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:11,164
I assume you got a man
out there, with a clean shot?

466
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,832
More than one.

467
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,292
Then I'll skip
the fucking hors d'oeuvres,

468
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,170
if you don't mind, and we'll
just cut straight to it, yeah?

469
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,213
You mentioned on the phone
that you could help

470
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,132
with Homelander's son.

471
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,302
I must say, I'm not sure
what you mean.

472
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,346
That boy is your
only possible contingency

473
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,348
against Homelander.

474
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,518
Now, that contingency don't work

475
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,146
if they're off playing
Ward and the Beav.

476
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,272
(water pouring)

477
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,440
I can fix that.

478
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,236
Thank you, Alvin.

479
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,823
Homelander's a friend.

480
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,909
Why would I betray him?

481
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,661
Because you're
a ruthless bastard.

482
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,540
That's hurtful.

483
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,125
You turned a racist
piece of shite

484
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,127
into America's sweetheart.

485
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,379
What word would you use?

486
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,091
(clears throat)

487
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,265
Stormfront's good
at making people angry.

488
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,976
Angry people want Compound V.

489
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,562
Compound V
raises our stock price.

490
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,107
Look, I'd have preferred
V remained a secret,

491
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,068
but we play with the cards
we're dealt.

492
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,404
It's not ruthless,
it's prices per share.

493
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,031
That's all.

494
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,034
Maybe you should take a look
in the mirror, mate.

495
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,161
'Cause that bitch
should bother you.

496
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,705
Of course she does.

497
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,583
But it's not about me.

498
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,502
I can't lash out

499
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:43,381
like some raging,
entitled maniac.

500
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,466
That's a white man's luxury.

501
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,388
So, it's just business,
then, eh?

502
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,307
When, Mr. Butcher, in history,

503
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,394
has it ever been
about anything different?

504
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,230
And what makes you think

505
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:02,400
that you can control
that racist bitch?

506
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,820
(sighs) Look,
I've got to get across town...

507
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,197
Look, I can get the boy away
from Homelander, all right?

508
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,907
How?

509
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,952
That's my business.

510
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,915
When I got him,
I'll call your people,

511
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,500
they zero in
on this cell signal,

512
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,669
and then come and scoop him up.

513
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,838
And then you
do a better fucking job

514
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,464
of hiding him this time, yeah?

515
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,968
You have my word.

516
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,012
I will get Rebecca and Ryan
somewhere safe.

517
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,430
No.

518
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,891
Not Becca.
Becca stays with me.

519
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,976
But that's the whole point.

520
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,270
That he's raised by his mother.

521
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,605
Find him a new fucking mum.

522
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,399
I'm taking my wife back.
That's the deal.

523
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:47,069
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up on my doorstep,

524
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,989
begging to be reunited
with her boy?

525
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,369
You say it's the only way

526
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,414
you can guarantee Ryan's
protection from Homelander.

527
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,375
'Cause as you know,

528
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,754
a mother will do anything

529
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,006
to protect her son.

530
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,760
And you call me
a ruthless bastard.

531
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,387
You tell me where he is...

532
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,307
...and I'll do the rest.

533
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,983
(birds chirping)

534
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:32,949
Where's Ryan?

535
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,326
He's, um, he's inside.

536
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,869
He doesn't want to talk.

537
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,996
-So, go in anyway.
-No, no, no, no. I've tried.

538
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,123
He... he wants to be left alone.

539
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,167
You are the strongest man
in the world,

540
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,420
and you're scared
of a little boy.

541
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,880
He's your blood.

542
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,549
Just talk to him.

543
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,593
Be the man I know you are.

544
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,431
RYAN:
New York. North Carolina.

545
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,060
North Dakota. Ohio.

546
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:05,314
Oklahoma. Oregon.

547
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,066
(sighs)

548
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,527
I'm sorry.

549
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,320
HOMELANDER:
No, no, no, no. Buddy,

550
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,738
don't you be sorry.

551
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,490
I... I should've known better.

552
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,915
There were just...
so many people.

553
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,959
Yeah, there was.

554
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,588
(sighs)

555
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:37,430
You know, I remember
the first time I was in a crowd.

556
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,473
Probably didn't bother you.

557
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,267
I was terrified.

558
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,020
All these people staring at me

559
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,063
and reaching out,
trying to grab me,

560
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,690
and egging me on
to use my powers.

561
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:51,819
I just-- I felt
like I was... drowning.

562
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,655
Well, what'd you do?

563
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,949
Well, I took off.

564
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,870
I flew away.

565
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,789
They found me 80 miles
down the I-9.

566
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,708
Crying my little eyes out.

567
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:12,298
You? Cry?

568
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,511
Yes.

569
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:25,519
But I'm a man,
so, not in a long while. But...

570
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,230
who knows, maybe, uh...

571
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,900
maybe next time,
you'll fly away.

572
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,944
Maybe... with me.

573
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,909
Look...

574
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,370
I know you want me
to be like you.

575
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,163
But, Dad, I'm not.

576
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,380
Son... (exhales)

577
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:56,300
I didn't just wake up one day
and fly out the door.

578
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,095
That's not how it works.
I had to learn.

579
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,097
Only I didn't have anyone
to teach me,

580
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,350
'cause the doctors that-- um...

581
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,436
(chuckles)
The people that raised me,

582
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,897
uh, were scared of me,

583
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,899
so they kept their distance.

584
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:15,194
And I had to figure it all out
by myself, see?

585
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,905
Well, you-you don't have
to go through any of that.

586
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,907
I'll teach you.

587
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,700
Really?

588
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,162
I love you.

589
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,269
Hey, did you find anything?

590
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,272
They got him in a cabin
up in Rochester.

591
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,400
-What?
-I mean... Becca!

592
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,986
She's great.
We-we talked earlier.

593
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,946
And, um, she's-she's
really great. She's--

594
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,198
-You're really-- you're great.
-All right, easy, tiger.

595
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,117
How'd you get on?
I guess you got fuck all?

596
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,537
No witnesses. But we definitely
found fuck all.

597
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,081
I'm not sure I'm using that term
properly, but, uh...

598
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,125
here.

599
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,171
Fuck me.

600
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,047
This is a jackpot.

601
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,758
Well done, you two.

602
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,969
This'll do nicely.

603
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,554
All right, listen up, you lot.

604
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,181
Getting the kid back,
it ain't your fight,

605
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,765
and I ain't gonna ask you
to come along.

606
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,768
Lick my big black balls,
Butcher.

607
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,978
Sorry, Becca.

608
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,563
You done asked us to lie,

609
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,108
spy, do all kinds
of fucked up shit for you.

610
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,402
Now we finally get a chance
to do something good,

611
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,446
and you think we're gonna
take a pass on that?

612
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,031
We're in.

613
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,699
Of course we're in.

614
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,036
All right.

615
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,622
Let's get a shift on.

616
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,665
♪ ♪

617
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,464
(camera clicking)

618
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,361
What?

619
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,072
You remember the range
at Fort Bragg?

620
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,366
I was a better shot than you.

621
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,994
Well, you had a bloody
good teacher, didn't you?

622
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,413
I like your friends.

623
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,874
Especially Hughie.
He's, uh... (chuckles)

624
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,292
He's good for you.

625
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,880
Look, Becca...
you ain't coming with us.

626
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,340
Bullshit.

627
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,050
Ryan doesn't know you,
he'll never come to you.

628
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,177
It's too dangerous, and I ain't
gonna lose you again.

629
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,346
He's my son, and I'm coming.

630
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,525
I need you
to promise me something.

631
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,528
I need you to promise me
that you will save him

632
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,905
no matter what
and you will get him back to me.

633
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,034
Yeah. Of course.

634
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,536
You realize this isn't
just about me, right?

635
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,496
Like, h-he can't grow up
like Homelander.

636
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,373
You have to think
of all of the people

637
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,251
out there that he would...

638
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,965
Swear to me, then.

639
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,009
You swear to me

we have authenticated photos

including Goebbels and Goring.

709
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:33,048
Based on the photos, it is now
believed that she was the wife

I give you my word,

967
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,550
-no one will ever...
-(exhales)

968
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,386
(TV turns off)

969
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,846
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

970
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:28,307
Always happy to see you, sir.

971
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,517
ALASTAIR:
I'm afraid we had

972
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:32,186
an incident at the Archives.

973
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,398
Someone broke in
and stole PDR on Stormfront.

974
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,109
Hmm. PDR?

975
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,318
Private data reserve.

976
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,947
No one saw the thief come or go.

977
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:46,367
Isn't that right, A-Train?

978
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,954
That was you? Dude.

979
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,081
I didn't know, sir. Fuck him.

980
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,083
-I would never go
behind your back.
-Please,

981
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,503
-just let me explain.
-I think it showed initiative.

982
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:00,339
Stormfront's been critical
of the Church for a long time,

983
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:03,718
and Vought needs to take a firm
anti-Nazi stance right now.

984
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,344
A-TRAIN:
Wait.

985
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:08,347
-D-Does that mean...
-I just spoke to Stan Edgar.

986
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,849
You're back in.

987
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,851
-Fuck yeah!
-What? Yeah!

988
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,894
-Yeah! A-Train is back, baby!
-(whoops)

989
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,646
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

990
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,440
-(laughs) All right!
-Whew!

991
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,109
-Finally! (laughs)
-Yeah.

992
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:23,362
I'm back too, right?
Right? I'm anti-Nazi.

993
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:27,199
I'm sorry, Deep,
but they only had one slot.

994
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,869
One hero is redemption,
two is weakness.

995
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,287
So they took him?

996
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,289
Fuck yes, they did!

997
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,125
Well, shit! Peace out, bitch!

998
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,793
Ha ha!

999
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,048
ALASTAIR:
You have to be patient, Deep.

1000
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,550
We'll get you into a few more
courses, up to Level Seven.

1001
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:46,177
No, I don't want to pay
for any more fucking courses!

1002
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,678
Deep, please calm down.

1003
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,430
I signed over my bank account
to you.

1004
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,974
I filled out all those
fucking children's workbooks!

1005
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:55,227
I married some weirdo
who gives terrible blowjobs!

1006
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,606
I-I did everything you asked,
and when I found out that

1007
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,900
we're all just fucking
space spores, I didn't laugh.

1008
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,818
I did everything you asked.

1009
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,862
Because you said you'd get me
back in The Seven.

1010
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:07,281
-You fucking promised.
-I'm sorry, Deep,

1011
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,742
but you are acting
like a toxic personality.

1012
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,410
I think you should leave.

1013
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,581
(scoffs)

1014
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,751
Fuck Fresca.

1015
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,177
Look at you.

1016
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,971
I know. I know...

1017
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:34,892
But if Billy Butcher
can do the right thing,

1018
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:39,605
then there's got to be
some kind of higher power.

1019
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,484
You know?

1020
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:47,238
Are you sure it's safe for you
to go back into the Tower?

1021
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,240
No.

1022
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:52,326
No, I'm not. But...

1023
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:55,079
If you jump ship
and you let the assholes steer,

1024
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:59,083
then you're part of the problem.

1025
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,670
-And...
-Hmm.

1026
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,465
...someone taught me something
about hanging in there.

1027
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,093
(laughs softly)

1028
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:22,398
I've been thinking
about that lately...

1029
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,942
the hanging in there.

1030
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:28,362
And I think maybe I am
too clingy.

1031
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,447
-No, you're not.
-Sticking with people

1032
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,325
just because I'm terrified
of losing them?

1033
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,743
I-I...

1034
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:38,205
I can't do that anymore.

1035
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,168
I think it's time I go off,

1036
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,420
stand on my own two feet
for once.

1037

We'll just be friends, then.

Oh-- oh, God, no. No, no, no.
