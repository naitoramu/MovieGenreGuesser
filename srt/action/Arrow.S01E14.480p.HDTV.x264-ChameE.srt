1
00:00:00,332 --> 00:00:02,588
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,737
For 5 years I was stranded on
an island with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:08,806
survive.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,342
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,961
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:15,314
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:18,150
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,353
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:25,024
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,525
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,777
Slade Wilson.
There's an airfield

12
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,146
10 clicks from here.
It's key off this island.

13
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:32,537
I think Yao Fei sent you

14
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:34,707
because he knows I cannot
take the airstrip alone.

15
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:38,203
You bugged my mother?
Just listen.

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,855
I made it clear
to him persuasively

17
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:43,075
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

18
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,693
What are you going to do?

19
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,546
I need to have another chat
with my mom.

20
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,883
And I'll need the Unidac merger
finalized by the end of the week.

21
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,885
We're on something
of a clock here.

22
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,267
Moira Queen,

23
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,903
you have failed this city.

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,492
Stand still!

25
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,078
Please don't kill me.

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,332
Do you know anything about
your husband's disappearance?

27
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,784
What?!
Is Walter Steel still alive?!

28
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,569
I don't know
where my husband is.

29
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,621
I swear.

30
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,674
Do you know anything
about the Undertaking?

31
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,793
I said don't move!

32
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,129
I'm--I'm a mother.

33
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,014
I have a son--Oliver.

34
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,916
A daughter,
her name is Thea.

35
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:43,095
She's just a teenager.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,909
Please don't take me
from my children.

37
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,522
They lost their father.

38
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,442
They can't
lose me, too.

39
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,095
Please, whoever
you are, please.

40
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:56,231
Okay.

41
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:01,770
I'm not going to hurt you.

42
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,114
This is Moira Queen,
I'm on the 39th floor,

43
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:14,783
I need help.

44
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,785
There's an intruder.

45
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:19,504
Please!

46
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:34,206

48

Ohh!

49
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:51,753
I'm not going to hurt you,
Felicity.

50
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,372
How do you know my name?

51
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,624
Because you know my name.

52
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,711
Oliver, oh...

53
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,329
Wow.

54
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,249
Everything about you just
became so unbelievably clear.

55
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,884
You're bleeding.

56
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,302
I don't need to be told that.

57
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,854
You need a hospital.

58
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,690
My--my father's old factory,
in the Glades.

59
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,725
No, you-- you need a doctor,
not a steelworker.

60
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,278
Felicity...You have
to promise me

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,814
that you are going to take me
to my father's factory

62
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:20,599
and nowhere else.

63
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,684
Yeah, promise.

64
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:29,324
Something tells me blood stains
are not covered under my lease.

65
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:31,827
So far the police
are unwilling to comment,

66
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,712
but unsubstantiated
eyewitness reports

67
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,915
claims that the Starling City
vigilante attacked Mrs. Queen

68
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,583
in her office earlier tonight.

69
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,086
She was unharmed
in the assault.

70
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,804
Excuse me.

71
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,307
Can you help me?
He's really heavy!

72
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:55,066
Oh, damn it.

73
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,768
He just missed
a carotid.

74
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,404
It's a zone two wound.
Press there.

75
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,239
I should have taken
him to a hospital.

76
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,075
No, Felicity, that's why he
asked you to bring him here.

77
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,126
Because he knew the police

78
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,361
would want to know how
and why he got the wound.

79
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,285
I'm guessing how and why
are Oliver Queen's

80
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,033
least favorite questions.

81
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:15,420
Yeah, well, there's also when
and where, he's not too fond of.

82
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,539
So if we can't bring him
to the hospital...

83
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,342
We bring
the hospital to him.

84
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,760
Is that...

85
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,796
Yeah. His blood.
He stored it for a rainy day.

86
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,965
And I say right now,
it's pouring.

87
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,416
I got it.
Over there.

88
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,135
Do you know what you're doing?

89
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,853
Yeah, I had some
medical training

90
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,438
in the army.

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,257
I just hope
it's enough.

92
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,227
Remember playing "Operation"
when you were a kid?

93
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,780
Yes.

94
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,782
And it never made me
want to throw up.

95
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,535
Hey, Felicity, listen, trust me.
He'll be fine.

96
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,098
He's been through
a lot worse than this.

97
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,710
Ah, damn.

98
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,007
How did you survive here
for six months?

99
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,227
I know girl scouts who
have more fight in them.

100
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,962
Fighting girl scouts now,
Slade, huh?

101
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:15,263
Oww!

102
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:16,998
What the hell?!

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,767
Listen, kid.
We have ten days

104
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,519
until the supply
plane lands.

105
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,872
Ten days to turn you
into at least half a soldier.

106
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:27,025
So start taking it
seriously.

107
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,999
What is the point of this?!

108
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,251
These soldiers
don't carry bamboo!

109
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,119
They have guns!
So what am I supposed to do

110
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,372
if one them jams
a gun in my face, huh?

111
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,374
Threaten them with my stick?!

112
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,760
Jam this in my face.

113
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,297
Do it.

114
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,477
I give up.
I give up.

115
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,031
There is no giving up
to these guys!

116
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,985
No crying, or buying
your way out of it!

117
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:12,954
You have two choices--

118
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,408
escape, or die.

119
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,743
So choose.

120
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,245
Escape.

121
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,197
Then let me show you

122
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,250
how not to die.

123
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,778
Lian Yu.

124
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,364
It's the name
of the island, I know.

125
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,016
It's Mandarin for "Purgatory".

126
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,768
It is? Wonderful.

127
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,887
Is that the air strip?

128
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,441
A.S.I.S. took satellite images
of the whole island.

129
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,159
This is Fyers'
main camp,

130
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,611
where I was held
for almost a year.

131
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,480
Do--do you think
that's where Yao Fei is now?

132
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,082
'Cause we could get
a message to him.

133
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,867
We can tell him we found
a way off the island.

134
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,669
Forget about him.

135
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,188
This is the airstrip.

136
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,757
And these infrared
images show

137
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,008
there are at last
ten soldiers guarding

138
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,610
the perimeter
at any given time.

139
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:10,045
Too many of 'em
for you?

140
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,047
No.

141
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,649
My problem is the guy
here in the tower.

142
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:17,602
It's a PTAC. A portable
air traffic control tower.

143
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,604
The U.S. government
set up these for disaster zones,

144
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,906
like Thailand
after the Tsunami.

145
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,976
So what's the problem?

146
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,978
The glass is bulletproof.

147
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,898
I can't take out the tower guard
with my sniper rifle.

148
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,549
And if he suspects
anything's wrong,

149
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,819
he'll radio Fyers
and we're cancelled.

150
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,489
It'll be up to you
to take him out.

151
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,557
Up close and personal.

152
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,576
Are you ready for that?

153
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,479
Do you think
I'm ready?

154
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:48,667
What I think is there's only
one supply plane every 3 months.

155
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,720
We leave tomorrow,
or we die soon afterwards.

156
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,789
I pick leaving.

157
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:59,678
So get some sleep.
We leave at 0600.

158
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:09,654
Don't worry.

159
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,190
You'll be back with your girlfriend
soon enough.

160
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:38,400
Morning.

161
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,138
Please don't hate me.

162
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,391
Why would I hate you?

163
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,477
For cheating on you with Sarah.

164
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,949
Did it hurt, Ollie?

165
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,234
Did what hurt?

166
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,953
When they killed you?

167
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,657
Rise and shine.

168
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,642
Come on.

169
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,995
We're moving out.

170
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,795
All clear.

171
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,748
Hey, can we, um, can we rest
for a second?

172
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,051
You can rest on the plane.

173
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,303
Gosh, well, really
looking forward

174
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,888
to that
in-flight movie.

175
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,758
Oh, God.
Don't move.

176
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,478
Is it a mine?

177
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:23,621
Yeah.

178
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,106
The soldiers
mine the island?

179
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:26,407
No, it's probably Japanese,

180
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,159
left over from World War II.

181
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,245
Still active.

182
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,779
Impressive.

183
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,499
Can you disarm it?

184
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,168
Without disarming you?

185
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:43,578
Soldiers.

186
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:52,366
Can they see us?

187
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,618
They can only see you.

188
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,787
Wait! Stop!

189
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:10,434
What are you doing
so far from camp?

190
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,236
I got separated
from my unit.

191
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,704
Come with us.

192
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,724
I--I can't.

193
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:20,394
I'm kind of having
a bad day, you know?

194
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,242
Be still.

195
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,920
Thanks.

196
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:55,763
Yao Fei.

197
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,566
Come in. Sit.

198
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,353
Now the first time

199
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:06,157
I saw you with
this contraption...

200
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,527
I thought you looked
utterly ridiculous.

201
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,746
That is, until you took out

202
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:15,116
three of my best men
with it.

203
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,985
25 compound bows
will be arriving

204
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,221
on tomorrow's supply plane.

205
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:24,675
I'd like you to train a few
of my men on how to use them.

206
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:28,963
Archery can take years
to master.

207
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:32,766
Well, I trust you'll be
a proficient instructor.

208
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,386
That'll be all.

209
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:44,277
I hope you are steadfast

210
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:46,378
in your commitment
to our cause, Yao Fei.

211
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,983
For her sake.

212
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:52,069
I am.

213
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,160
Obviously you were never
a boy scout.

214
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:01,829
Yeah? What
tipped you off?

215
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,431
We better hurry.

216
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,467
The wolves come out at night.

217
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:09,720
There are wolves here?

218
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,039
Right. Of course
there are.

219
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,757
Because what would
the worst place on earth be

220
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,509
without wolves.

221
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,229
The only thing that will
keep them out is fire.

222
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,014
Well, you know,
you're welcome to help.

223
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:30,241
Seriously?

224
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,193
I've been working on
this for two hours.

225
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,828
I know. I was watching you.

226
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,398
Thank you for the entertainment.

227
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:51,712
You're going to wear that thing out
just by looking at it.

228
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,347
Don't worry.

229
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:56,684
She'll be waiting for flowers
when you get back.

230
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,719
I doubt it.

231
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:02,022
Remember how I told you
I was shipwrecked here?

232
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:05,259
Her sister was with me
when the boat went down.

233
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,861
That's funny. I never took you
as being the bad boy.

234
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,030
You seem to lack the spine.

235
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,533
That's why I've got
to get home.

236
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,235
To make this right.

237
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:17,321
If you think you can sleep
with your girlfriend's sister

238
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,323
and still make it right...

239
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,710
You're dumber than I thought.
And believe me when I tell you

240
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:25,462
that is saying something.

241
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,298
Yeah, well, you don't really
strike me as the type of guy

242
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,550
who accepts
apologies, so.

243
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:32,469
Well, everybody is in
this life for themselves.

244
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,389
Learn that at Australian
spy school?

245
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:39,009
No. I learned that here.

246
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,894
Do you remember I told you
that I had a partner?

247
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,896
Yeah.

248
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,766
Do you remember
the guy who tortured you?

249
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:53,941
That freak show
was your partner?!

250
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,609
His name's Billy Wintergreen.

251
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,077
Oh. Ok.

252
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,979
Our mission was
to exfiltrate Yao Fei

253
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,815
and to find out why Fyers and his men
were so interested in him.

254
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,618
But our bird got shot out of the sky
before we even saw the airstrip.

255
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,154
That's where
I found you.

256
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,924
When Fyers took us prisoner,

257
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:13,177
he asked if we would
join him and his men.

258
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,263
Billy accepted
Fyers' invitation.

259
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,549
I declined.

260
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:23,270
He was the godfather
to my son Joe.

261
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:26,940
And yet, he turned
his back on me

262
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:30,894
without even thinking twice
about it.

263
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,448
Everybody is in this life
for themselves!

264
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:53,917
If you let him radio camp,
we're done.

265
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:58,872
What about the others?
You worry about your one.

266
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,641
I'll worry about my ten.

267
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:25,999
Good job.

268
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,234
I think.

269
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,836
His heart rate's elevated,

270
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,170
but at least
the bleeding stopped.

271
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:32,005
Thanks for your help.

272
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:33,340
You kept your head on.

273
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:35,342
Well, I always wondered
how I'd react

274
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,429
if I found my boss shot
and bleeding inside my car.

275
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,130
Not that I helped
because he's my boss.

276
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,016
I'd help anyone
who was shot

277
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:45,686
and bleeding
in my car.

278
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,972
I was thinking all of this
would be more of a shock.

279
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,142
What, are you saying
you called this all along?

280
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,528
I'm not saying
anything.

281
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,314
Except Oliver brought me
a laptop riddled with bullet holes,

282
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,099
had me trace
a black arrow,

283
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,703
and research a company involved
in armored car heists.

284
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:05,656
I may be blonde,
but I'm not that blonde.

285
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,659
Yeah, Oliver's not too great with
the cover stories.

286
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,461
Neither are you.

287
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,962
The two of you
with that whole

288
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,332
energy drink hangover cure?
Please.

289
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,135
What was really
in that vial, anyway?

290
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,255
Vertigo.
I knew it!

291
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,457
I mean, I didn't know
it was Vertigo for sure,

292
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,009
but I definitely knew it wasn't
something that could cure a hangover.

293
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,371
Yeah, we needed it analyzed
so we could take down the count.

294
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:31,798
That was you and Oliver?

295
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,650
And you, Felicity.

296
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,570
Without you, we never
would have found him.

297
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:40,023
But why come to me?

298
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,279
Hard as it probably is
for him to admit,

299
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:49,082
even Oliver
needs help sometimes.

300
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:42,899
What's happening?!

301
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,067
There's a syringe
labeled Ativan.

302
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:45,869
It should stop
the seizure. Go.

303
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,655
His heart stopped.

304
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,446
I'm calling 9-1-1.

305
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:53,148
No. Wait, you can't.

306
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,167
You know how to use
one of those?

307
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:58,837
We are about
to find out.

308
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:02,207
You didn't say clear!

309
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,793
I heard the charge.

310
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:07,179
That's good news.
How's that?

311
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:08,663
It means it might not
be the machine,

312
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,432
it could be the wiring.

313
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:12,000
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

314
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,519
Try again.

315
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:15,354
Clear.

316
00:20:29,702 --> 00:20:33,322
What the hell
did you do?

317
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:35,991
I've been building computers
since I was seven.

318
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:37,876
Wires are wires.

319
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:39,995
What do we do now?

320
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:42,664
Pray we don't have
a heart attack ourselves.

321
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:59,231
One job to do,

322
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:02,184
and you manage
to screw up even then.

323
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:09,557
I'm going to go make sure that
everything is clear.

324
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,826
Stay here,
keep the door locked.

325
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:13,362
Do not let anybody in
except for me.

326
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:15,697
You got that?
Yeah.

327
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:19,501
Here. Keep this.

328
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:22,537
And try not to shoot
yourself by mistake.

329
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:59,241
Hello?

330
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:04,162
Hello?

331
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,752
Is anybody there?

332
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:15,757
Have you lost
your mind?

333
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,926
They might be
monitoring the calls.

334
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:22,791
Island tower.
This is Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot,

335
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:25,608
we are 700 kilometers
southeast of your position.

336
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:29,603
ETA, three hours,
22 minutes, over.

337
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:36,777
Island tower,
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

338
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,496
Acknowledged.

339
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,618
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

340
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,220
Acknowledged.

341
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:49,289
Of all creatures that breath
and move upon the earth.

342
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:52,926
What is that?

343
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,395
It's a challenge code.

344
00:22:54,397 --> 00:22:58,148
They're trying
to verify our identity.

345
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,802
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

346
00:23:01,804 --> 00:23:03,354
Please repeat.

347
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:07,408
Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the earth.

348
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,277
Wait.
What?

349
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,579
Wait, I know this.
I know this.

350
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:16,650
They picked the one book
that I read in college.

351
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:18,168
What the hell are
you talking about?

352
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,621
A quote, from "The Odyssey".

353
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,589
Ohh.

354
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:27,994
Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the earth,

355
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,680
nothing--nothing is born

356
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:32,599
that is weaker than man.

357
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:34,868
Are you sure about this?
Because if you're wrong,

358
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,169
this plane
will turn around.

359
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,806
Yes, yes. I'm positive.

360
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:41,975
Nothing is born

361
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:43,360
that is weaker than man.

362
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:45,195
Say it.

363
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,148
Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

364
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,683
Sorry. Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

365
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,852
Bred.

366
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:54,020
Not born, bred.

367
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,573
Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

368
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,692
That's it.

369
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:02,796
Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

370
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,833
Roger that.
See you in a few hours.

371
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:07,918
Out.

372
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,387
"The Odyssey".

373
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,090
Yeah! It's, uh, well,
it's a story about a guy

374
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:16,393
who's trying to get home, so.

375
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:17,456
Well,
after a few days

376
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,205
at Langstughl Airbase,

377
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:21,738
you'll be
on your way home.

378
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,940
But you sound like
you're not coming with me.

379
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,542
I'll be coming
with you.

380
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:29,713
After I radio in an airstrike
on this location.

381
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:34,635
I'm going to send Fyers and
all his men straight back to hell.

382
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:43,604
Wait.

383
00:24:44,764 --> 00:24:47,629
You can't blow up the island.

384
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:49,764
Yao Fei is still out there.

385
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,886
He is not my concern.
Really?

386
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:53,387
He's the only reason
you came here.

387
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:55,657
Rescuing him
was your mission!

388
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:56,891
Well, the mission
has changed.

389
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,893
Edward Fyers
is a mercenary

390
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:01,062
and he is not on
this island by mistake.

391
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,730
He has plans
for me and you

392
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:03,898
that involve Yao Fei.

393
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,918
And whatever they are,
they must end.

394
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,422
Yao Fei saved my life.

395
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,875
That is your debt
to repay,

396
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:16,594
not mine.

397
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:22,300
Where are you going?!

398
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,438
All my life,

399
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,091
all that I've ever
thought about is myself.

400
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:33,061
I took my family
for granted.

401
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:35,396
I betrayed people
that I loved.

402
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:41,486
And I'm not going to be
that person anymore.

403
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:47,942
I can't leave
Yao Fei here to die.

404
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:49,827
I won't.

405
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:53,464
The plane leaves
in three hours.

406
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,583
If you and your friend
are not on it,

407
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:58,119
I am going to leave
without you.

408
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:10,481
If I don't make it
back in time,

409
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:14,736
and you get out
of here...

410
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:18,973
I want you
to call my family.

411
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:21,492
Call my family.

412
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,163
Sure, kid.

413
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:54,309
He's going into
cardiac arrest again.

414
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:55,693
No.

415
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:58,029
Ah. The leads
just came loose.

416
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:00,281
Arghh!

417
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:03,651
It's less stressful when
he's jumping off rooftops.

418
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:08,156
Ohh.

419
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:12,243
This bow has put arrows
in quite a few people.

420
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,696
Yeah, bad people.

421
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:19,017
That doesn't bother you?

422
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:22,036
Because...

423
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:24,205
And I mean this
in a good way,

424
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:27,508
you seem like the kind
of guy it would bother.

425
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,946
When I was in
Afghanistan,

426
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:36,067
my unit was tasked
with protecting this local war lord.

427
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:39,070
Gholem Qadir.

428
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:41,272
Qadir was less than
human, sold opium.

429
00:27:41,274 --> 00:27:42,907
Sold children.

430
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:44,809
One day,

431
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,944
we were accompanying
him to Mosul

432
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:50,081
when my convoy
was ambushed by insurgents.

433
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,699
We had them outgunned.

434
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:53,084
Fire fight didn't last more
than a minute.

435
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:55,370
When the smoke cleared,

436
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:57,238
I moved in
on their position.

437
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,592
They were all dead.
I knew which one I had killed.

438
00:28:02,895 --> 00:28:05,079
When I pulled off
his keffiyeh,

439
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:08,049
I could see it was just
a kid, no more than 18.

440
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:11,119
Shot him in the throat.

441
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:13,871
I killed this kid
to protect

442
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:15,390
this human piece
of garbage,

443
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:17,892
and I thought,
am I still good?

444
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:21,612
Am I still
a good man?

445
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:27,101
Doing this with Oliver;

446
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:29,620
doing what we do,
I feel good again

447
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:32,206
for the first time
in a long time.

448
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:36,577
And that's worth
all the collateral damage?

449
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,746
I haven't killed anyone, if that's
what you're asking.

450
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:40,748
But he has.

451
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,085
Unfortunately,

452
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:48,005
there are always casualties
when you're fighting a war.

453
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:36,437
How did you...

454
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:38,839
Come on, let's go.
I'll explain on the way.

455
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:40,775
Stupid boy. You should never
have come back here!

456
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:43,194
I found Slade Wilson
and he has a way off the island,

457
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:45,196
but we have to go
right now.

458
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,198
No. No!

459
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,016
What? What
do you mean, no?

460
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:50,671
This is our chance.

461
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:52,037
What--what reason
could you possibly have

462
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:53,538
for staying here?!

463
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,491
Not what. Who.

464
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,032
Ah, Mr. Queen,
I think it's past time

465
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:08,219
you left this island.
Permanently.

466
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,437
Island tower,
Seahawk 801 Foxtrot.

467
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:26,139
We are 5,000 feet
and holding, over.

468
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:29,943
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

469
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:31,695
This is island tower.

470
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,365
You're clear to land.

471
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,945
Simply to satisfy
my own curiosity,

472
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,130
why aren't you
already dead?

473
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:52,132
I saw Yao Fei
choke you to death.

474
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:54,702
I guess he's not as strong
as he looks.

475
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,355
Still,
you return for him.

476
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,491
So you're either a fool,

477
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:04,111
or is it possible you now think
yourself a hero?

478
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,780
I'm not a hero.
Of course not.

479
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,148
It's not possible
to be a hero

480
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,168
when there's nobody
worthy of saving.

481
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:15,039
Is this what you want?

482
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,658
Did you want me
to fight him again?!

483
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,959
Oh, no, Mr. Queen.

484
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,495
That's where
you're mistaken.

485
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:23,330
This is not a match.

486
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:25,366
It's an execution.

487
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:28,218
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,063
It's Wintergreen, right?

489
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,598
Bill Wintergreen?

490
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,490
I know all about you.

491
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,743
I know you work
for the Australian government.

492
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,895
And that you used
to fight for your country.

493
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:58,398
You used to stand
for something!

494
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,465
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll triple it.

495
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,558
How many of them
are there?!

496
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:38,104
Slade. Come back to die?

497
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:52,836
Was it so easy
to betray me, Billy?

498
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,691
You know, Billy...

499
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,279
You always had a good kick.

500
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:08,050
There goes our plane.

501
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:20,635
Wow.

502
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:23,521
I'm impressed.

503
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:25,473
You didn't puke.

504
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:27,308
I swallowed it.

505
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,561
You can
untie me now.

506
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,516
Why'd you want me
to tie you up in the first place?

507
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:38,036
A man in pain is unreliable.

508
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:41,573
I was afraid
I might kill you.

509
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:44,075
Thanks.

510
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:45,994
What?

511
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,361
It's just...

512
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:49,030
What?

513
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:50,715
I'm trapped
on an island

514
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:54,085
and my only friend
is named Wilson. So.

515
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:59,007
What now?

516
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:01,142
We hope my fireworks
show set Fyers back,

517
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:03,061
maybe enough for those
who hired him in the first place

518
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,679
to call things off.

519
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:05,980
Hired him?

520
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:09,017
Well, Fyers is a merc.
He follows the money.

521
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:12,487
So he's on this island
under someone's employ.

522
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:14,773
Then what do we do?
We have to make sure

523
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:17,992
that neither of us dies on this
godforsaken island.

524
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:20,412
I though you said
if we didn't get on the plane...

525
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:22,914
We weren't going to make it.

526
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:26,334
Well, that dumb kid
that I trained,

527
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,402
he would never
have made it.

528
00:35:28,404 --> 00:35:30,705
You?

529
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,261
You might just
have a chance.

530
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:39,848
Yep, it's Fyers.

531
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,684
Satellites showed
multiple heat blooms on the island.

532
00:35:42,686 --> 00:35:44,018
What the hell
is happening there?

533
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,471
There was a complication.
Slade Wilson?

534
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:47,922
I'm handling it.

535
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:49,590
Well, handle it better.
I've worked too hard

536
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:52,093
and planned for too long
to have complications arise

537
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:53,528
so close to the end.

538
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,896
I assure you,
it won't happen again.

539
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:55,930
What about Yao Fei?

540
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:58,199
I've ensured his cooperation.

541
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:00,935
Good. Paid you a lot
of money, Fyers.

542
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:03,822
I expect a return
on my investment.

543
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:06,124
You sent for me.

544
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:08,126
I'm a man of my word.

545
00:36:08,128 --> 00:36:11,579
You made the right call today,
turning in your young castaway.

546
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:15,083
And for that,
I'll grant you five minutes.

547
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:23,758
Shado? Shado!

548
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,261
Shado!

549
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:36,821
Shh, shh, shh.

550
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:07,018
I guess I didn't die.

551
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,354
Again.

552
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,506
Cool.

553
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:21,699
It's not bad.

554
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:24,402
So how am I going
to explain this one?

555
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:26,187
Hickey gone wrong?

556
00:37:27,738 --> 00:37:31,144
The police collected a sample
of your blood at Queen Consolidated.

557
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:35,032
I just hacked the crime lab and
ordered the sample destroyed.

558
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,000
Oops. Heh.

559
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:42,039
I hope it's all right.

560
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,656
Your system looked like it was
from the eighties,

561
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:45,676
and not the good part
of the eighties,

562
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:48,962
like Madonna
and, well, legwarmers.

563
00:37:48,964 --> 00:37:51,465
It's a lot of work.

564
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,350
Does that mean you're in?
You mean in

565
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:56,219
as in I'm going
to join your crusade?

566
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:59,189
Well, you're practically an honorary
member of the team already.

567
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:01,558
Hmm. So Mr. Diggle said.

568
00:38:02,676 --> 00:38:04,844
No.

569
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:06,146
Then why'd
you upgrade my system?

570
00:38:06,148 --> 00:38:07,814
First, because
seeing a network

571
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:11,184
that poorly set up
hurts me. In my soul.

572
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:14,571
And second...
I want to find Walter.

573
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:17,374
My stepfather.

574
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:19,692
He was nice to me.

575
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:22,162
And Mr. Diggle told me that
the notebook you use

576
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:25,332
to fight crime is the same notebook
that got Walter abducted.

577
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:29,336
I'll help you rescue him,
but that's it.

578
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,724
Then I want to go back to my
boring life of being an I.T. girl.

579
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:37,377
That's my offer.

580
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,930
Ok.

581
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:44,651
So I've been
meaning to ask...

582
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:47,904
Is there a bathroom? 'Cause
I've had to pee since I got here.

583
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:49,889
It's upstairs to the left.

584
00:38:49,891 --> 00:38:52,225
Great.
Felicity.

585
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,083
Thank you.

586
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:02,536
Yeah.

587
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:12,879
Oliver, I know you don't
want to hurt this girl

588
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:15,682
and you didn't have any choice
in telling her who you really were,

589
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:19,519
but we're asking her to get involved in
some pretty dangerous stuff.

590
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:21,754
We can protect her.
How?

591
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:23,890
Your mother
just shot you, Oliver.

592
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:25,559
You can't even keep
yourself safe.

593
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:27,927
She was scared.
She was defending herself.

594
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:31,565
Or, she was hiding something.
Like maybe her involvement

595
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,650
in Walter's disappearance,
or worse.

596
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:37,237
Diggle, we don't always know
why people do what they do.

597
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,072
But what I do know

598
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:40,940
is that when I was
standing in her office

599
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:42,876
with an arrow
aimed at her heart,

600
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:45,212
she begged me
to spare her,

601
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:50,417
all on behalf
of me and Thea.

602
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:53,086
Now, I've taken down
a lot of bad people.

603
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,755
None of them brought
up their kids, Dig.

604
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:58,809
Oliver, she had the list.
Now she may not be in charge

605
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:00,393
of whatever "it" is,

606
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,962
but she's definitely involved.
Involved in what?!

607
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:06,016
We don't even know
what "it" is,

608
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:07,601
and until we do,

609
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:10,170
she is off limits!

610
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:13,857
Am I clear?

611
00:40:25,786 --> 00:40:28,268
But Oliver, are you saying
this because you truly

612
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:31,277
believe she's innocent?
Or because you don't want

613
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:33,442
to face the fact that
your mother might be guilty?

614
00:40:50,345 --> 00:40:51,978
6'1,

615
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,231
and a deep voice. I--

616
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:55,699
Hey.

617
00:40:55,701 --> 00:40:56,700
What's going on?

618
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:58,017
Where have you been?

619
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:59,536
I've been calling you
all night.

620
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:01,321
I was at the club. I get
zero reception in there.

621
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:02,989
Maybe it's time
you invest in a land mine.

622
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:05,208
Thea.
Your mother was attacked last night.

623
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,528
By the Vigilante.
What?!

624
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,963
He came after me
at the office.

625
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,464
Did he hurt you?
Are you ok?

626
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:12,999
Actually, she hurt him.
She shot him point blank

627
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:15,252
with a gun hidden
in her office.

628
00:41:15,254 --> 00:41:16,553
That should help
with your investigation.

629
00:41:16,555 --> 00:41:18,138
Did you get
any evidence,

630
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,675
like a blood
sample, or...

631
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:24,394
There was a screw-up
at the lab.

632
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,729
That's too bad.

633
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:27,597
Hmm.

634
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,350
We'll be in touch.

635
00:41:30,352 --> 00:41:32,602
Thank you.
Yes.

636
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,942
Oh, sweetheart.

637
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:40,160
I was so scared.

638
00:41:40,162 --> 00:41:42,061
I'm just glad
you're ok.

639
00:41:42,063 --> 00:41:45,115
I thought he was
going to kill me.

640
00:41:45,117 --> 00:41:48,067
Hey.

641
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:52,427
I promise you,

642
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,564
he's never going
to bother you again.
