1
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,961
We're going to request
unconditional and isolated imprisonment.

2
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:12,361
The convoy has been assaulted
by a group of Eastern subjects,

3
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,921
Silene Oliveira has escaped.

4
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,721
Río, it's Tokio. I'm going through
the heaven's gate. In a minute.

5
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:23,681
Tokio is coming!

6
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,481
We have to open the door, dammit!

7
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,521
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

8
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,441
No, we have to cover it up, damn it!

9
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:34,161
- Dad, look out!

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,201
Wait, wait.

11
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,321
He's bleeding out.

12
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:48,281
You're being held for
collaboration in the hostage assault.

13
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:51,001
to the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda.
You want me to believe

14
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:53,441
that you have feelings for me?
- It's happening to both of us.

15
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,641
From now on what you have to say

16
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,481
you say it directly to the judge.
- I'm so sorry, Raquel.

17
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,881
Keep going...!

18
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,161
How are we going to get out?
- Through a tunnel.

19
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:07,281
You're gonna have the hostages
digging in the boiler cellar.

20
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,481
We'll go out through another tunnel,

21
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,961
just take it from vault number three...

22
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:14,921
Soil!

23
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,081
to a hangar I already have planned.

24
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:20,321
That wall's got three blows.
Start digging,

25
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,481
I'll take care of imyself.
- We're going to dig

26
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,361
from this side too. Anyway,
we have to get out as soon as possible,

27
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,761
I've been discovered, Andrés.

28
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:28,921
Any news?

29
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,761
- Did you know that Sergio Marquina,
aka the Profesor, is Salva,

30
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,721
the brain from the heist?
- You got a call from that man,

31
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:37,201
minutes later you went
and destroyed the record with his fingerprints.

32
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,561
- I didn't know who that man was.

33
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,121
- Hand over your badge and gun.

34
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,041
Will you marry me, Ariadna?

35
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,561
- He wants me to marry him
when we get out.

36
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,961
And you're gonna do it?
- I'm going to keep all his money.

37
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,121
When he's by my side and he
can't even move anymore,

38
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,201
I'm gonna tell him
what a son of a bitch he is

39
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,681
and all the damage he's done to me.

40
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,201
Denver!
- What?

41
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,241
Go upstairs. You have to go upstairs now.

42
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:01,081
Agustín Ramos.
It has been a pleasure. I love you.

43
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:03,081
- I love you too, Dad.

44
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,761
Sergio, I'm only going in there if you promise.

45
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,921
that if things go to hell,
you won't let yourself get caught, you'll escape.

46
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,881
You're not gonna be waiting in the hangar.

47
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,761
Nothing will go wrong, we're the resistance.

48
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,801
We know it's close. Stop complicating things

49
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,481
and surrender.
- Surrender was never an option.

50
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:23,641
I'll wait for you.

51
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:25,721
It would be easier if Ángel was here.

52
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,721
- He's the only one who knows
the exact location of the hideout.

53
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,961
Inspector Murillo. I need the recordings

54
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,321
from the security camera out there.
Thank you.

55
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:55,321
Shall we cover him?

56
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:04,241
- Just like that?
We'll have to say a few words
or something, won't we?

57
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,641
Our Father who art in heaven,

58
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,481
hallowed be thy name.

59
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:32,281
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

60
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,801
- Thy kingdom come.
- Huh?

61
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,001
- That you skipped a paragraph.
After hallowed be thy name

62
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,401
It comes...
- What the fuck does that matter now?

63
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:44,761
- If you want to pray, you have to do it right.

64
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:47,641
- Do you think God will be there
seeing if you say it right or wrong?

65
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:57,081
Give us this day our daily bread.

66
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,561
And forgive our trespasses, as we forgive

67
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,761
those who trespass against us.

68
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,561
Lead us not into temptation

69
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:14,481
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

70
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:31,881
"There are times in life
when you should have

71
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,241
a damn remote control so you can stop it.

72
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:38,801
Even if it was only five minutes.

73
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:43,481
But sometimes things happen
with a reverent obscenity.

74
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,081
and there's nothing you can do about it.

75
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,841
On one side, we had just buried Moscú;

76
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:57,601
on the other, we were opening
the way to our freedom."

77
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,681
All the shops in the area match,
Inspector Murillo

78
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,081
has requisitioned security camera footage

79
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,881
crucial to the investigation.
- The undeniable proof

80
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,601
that she collaborates with the robbers.
- The intervention protocol

81
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:48,241
must be activated immediately.

82
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,201
Gather your best men.

83
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:53,921
- What about the hostages?
What about Alison Parker?

84
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:57,161
And international protocol?
What about citizen safety?

85
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,201
Colonel, they have large caliber weapons,

86
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,321
controlled access with explosives,

87
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,601
hostages dressed in overalls
and masks just like the muggers,

88
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,721
we won't be able to tell them apart.
Going in is going to be a slaughter

89
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,281
and you know it.
- And what do you propose?

90
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,401
Let those criminals get away
with Inspector Murillo

91
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:16,041
holding hands?
- Yes, let them out

92
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,281
and catch them once they're out.

93
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:23,201
- Do you know where public safety has taken us?

94
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,521
You want me to tell you?

95
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,361
To be a laughing stock. But not only from Spain,

96
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,681
from the whole fucking globe.
The news of half the world

97
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,681
follow the minute by minute of this heist

98
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,961
as if it were the World Cup.

99
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:39,881
Do you like being on TV with the headline:

100
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,081
"The assholes of the Spanish police

101
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:45,161
let in a runaway prisoner at the
Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

102
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,401
on a motorbike"?

103
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:48,521
On a motorbike!

104
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,321
Do you like being the fucking fool?

105
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,041
- Sorry...
- I didn't ask for your opinion.

106
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:01,001
The government just gave the order to intervene.

107
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,001
Those motherfuckers have been in there for 125 hours

108
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,561
and if, by any chance, they escape,
the discredit of this country

109
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,121
will be absolute.
- Sorry...

110
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,241
- What?

111
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,761
- The prosecution has issued an arrest warrant

112
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,561
against Inspector Raquel Murillo.
From this moment on

113
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:17,441
she is in search and arrest.

114
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,521
Where is he?
- In the warehouse.

115
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,441
I'm so sorry.

116
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,041
I'm so sorry.

117
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:53,281
Come here, come on.

118
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,001
The one from the cell phone.

119
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:01,921
Hi.

120
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:07,081
You can call her Stockholm, if you want.

121
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,001
It's not all gonna be crying, is it?

122
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:17,001
Go ahead.

123
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,561
984 million euros.

124
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:55,321
984 million euros.

125
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:01,281
984 million euros.

126
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,241
984 million euros. Yes.

127
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,881
Colonel, I've got my men ready to go in.

128
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,441
- Okay.
- There's something new in the tunnel.

129
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:50,921
- Data from the georadar indicate
that they are only a few meters

130
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:53,721
from the sewage network. We have an elite unit

131
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,001
in the sewers.

132
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:59,561
- Entering the main collector.
Distance to target:

133
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:02,641
300 meters north.
- Copy that. We're holding.

134
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,401
Suárez, we're going
to perform this operation

135
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,001
together, we'll make an engulfing tactic

136
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:20,321
harassing them from the flanks to force them

137
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:22,801
to get into the hole.
Which is a fucking sandwich.

138
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:25,081
- Push them from the inside out.

139
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:28,001
and wait for them in the sewers,
so they can't go back.

140
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:29,121
or hide and seek.

141
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,641
- We got them in a mousetrap
they can't get out of.

142
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,881
Now all that's left for us to do
is find Inspector Murillo

143
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:36,921
and her boyfriend.

144
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,441
Lieutenant.

145
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,561
Unit.
- Sir!

146
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,281
Are you ready?
- Yes, sir!

147
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,881
Berlín, get everyone to transport the money,
we have to leave now.

148
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,081
All right.
Assault units are arriving.

149
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:21,641
and they're going in.
Let's get on with it.

150
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:25,121
- We're already in.

151
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:45,361
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch!

152
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,441
Helsinki, I'm going to ruin you, I swear.

153
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,161
As soon as I get out of here
I'm going to sue you

154
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:55,841
for cruelty, torture
and crimes against humanity,

155
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:56,961
you bastard.

156
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:09,841
Arturito, let's go to the tunnel.

157
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,841
Your mission is very important, okay?

158
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:16,801
It was a fake.

159
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:20,281
It was a fake.

160
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:26,481
Get up, slowly.

161
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:32,561
Turn around.

162
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,041
And now you're coming to the police station.

163
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,841
And you're not gonna move a fucking hair,
because this time

164
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,161
I'm gonna shoot you.
You know why?

165
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:48,321
Because I've taken a little walk in the countryside

166
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,841
and I've had time to think and to regret

167
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,241
not having shot the biggest son of a bitch

168
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,601
that's ever crossed my path.
- Raquel, please.

169
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,721
And I don't kill you because I want to see you
in a prison for 30 years.

170
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:02,201
And there you could ask whoever you want

171
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,521
what they're wearing.

172
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,121
Don't move.

173
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,601
Don't move.

174
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,321
- Don't move!

175
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,441
- Stop there!

176
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,001
He was born on Labor Day.

177
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:25,441
All his birthdays,
ever since he started at the mine,

178
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:30,881
he said he had the party ready,
a good picket.

179
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:33,721
And that the rubber balls were his gifts.

180
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,321
And this year they were bullets.

181
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,561
I guess if you're born on the wrong side,

182
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,401
you die on the wrong side.

183
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,481
What's your name?

184
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,641
No, Mónica.
- I need to know your name.

185
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:58,641
Because I'm gonna get out of here with you.

186
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,041
I don't know if through the back door,
through the tunnel or with a machine gun,

187
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,561
but I don't want to be separated from you.

188
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:10,361
And if I have to learn to shoot, then I learn.

189
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,081
Besides,

190
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,401
this kid's gonna need a father.

191
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:24,081
Come on, tell me your name.

192
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,401
This is underfloor team, we're moving forward

193
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:52,601
through the sewers.

194
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,641
What's that noise?
- Quiet.

195
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,881
- It's the subway. Line six, it's passing over us.

196
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:03,401
- We go on.

197
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,361
Come on, gentlemen, don't let it go!

198
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:13,161
Let it be known that here we continue
to distribute magic

199
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,521
until the end!

200
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,801
In there we will take radio signal
and telesatellized video,

201
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,121
this way we will avoid the frequency inhibitors.

202
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:28,481
The bomb squad will breach the cargo door,

203
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:32,041
300 grams of termite explosive,
you know what that means.

204
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,201
Lobo, Ruiz, you'll make us cover fire

205
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:37,281
if necessary.

206
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,721
The rest of us, we'll line up one by one,

207
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:40,961
no one's left behind.

208
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:43,201
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

209
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:46,401
Gentlemen, we're going to find
some trouble in there,

210
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,001
so we're gonna be close, together.

211
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:52,961
All right?
- Yes, sir!

212
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:10,241
The only order

213
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:11,841
is not to shoot first if they're wearing masks.

214
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:15,961
But let's repel any shots

215
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,201
from anyone who opens fire on us.

216
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:20,721
- The only instruction is there's no order

217
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,241
for any of those motherfuckers to get out alive.

218
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:24,881
Is that clear?

219
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:36,561
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

220
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,121
We're ready, so let's go get them.

221
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,401
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

222
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,881
We shut down the machines
and delete all the records.

223
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,761
Then you take out the hard drives,
we'll take them.

224
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,201
- We have very little left to reach a billion,

225
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:28,761
is print some plates and that's it.
How much time do we need, Torres?

226
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,121
- Eleven minutes.
- Eleven minutes.

227
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:33,361
- You're rounding the figure, Nairobi.
What do you think this is?

228
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:34,881
'Wanna Bet'?

229
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,481
- You go pack, I'll take care of the money.

230
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,521
And if I say a billion, it's a billion.

231
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,281
- If I say stop, stop!

232
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,361
Do you know why I'm in charge?

233
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,401
Because you have cork inside your head.

234
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:52,441
You want to stay in this mousetrap
to reach a billion.

235
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,041
You know what that reminds me of?

236
00:21:57,121 --> 00:22:01,441
A mother who leaves her child,

237
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,881
a baby, to go sell pills.

238
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,761
And they get her, of course.
And they take away her child.

239
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,401
Under my command these things
don't happen, Nairobi.

240
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:21,481
No, no, under your command,
hostage weddings are planned.

241
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:25,041
What? Are you going to get married,
on the beach, dressed in white?

242
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,881
And you who control everything, do you know

243
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,001
how this woman feels about you?

244
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,521
To retch. I heard it in the bathroom.

245
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:39,881
The only reward she' s got left
is to keep your money.

246
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:43,201
Hold on until you have a seizure

247
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,561
and when you're dying, tell you to your face

248
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,321
that every time you raped her,

249
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:50,961
because you're raping her,

250
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:53,601
she went to the bathroom to puke.

251
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:59,761
That's all she's got left,
to spit at you on your deathbed.

252
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,121
That's what you turned her into.

253
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:10,121
Torres, turn off the machines.

254
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:13,201
- Miss Nairobi.

255
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,641
- Go turn off the machines, Torres.
- All right.

256
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:37,481
Río, are you there?
- Yes, Profesor.

257
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:40,361
The frequency is code encrypted.
- How long does it take

258
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,601
to decode it?
- At least two hours.

259
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,881
It's perfect. Place the explosive charges.

260
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,121
Pass the intercall to Berlín.
- Right now.

261
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:50,641
- Hey.

262
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,081
Come here, please.

263
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:03,881
Tell me.
- I don't feel well.

264
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:08,721
What do you have?
- My chest hurts a lot.

265
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,521
It could be an anxiety attack.
Do you want an anxiolytic?

266
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,001
It would have been a lot easier for me, too.

267
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,601
if none of this had happened.

268
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:03,121
You've been the only real crack in a perfect plan,

269
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:05,401
a plan that was perfect and no longer is.

270
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:06,521
Do you know why?

271
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:09,601
Because even if all this goes well,

272
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:16,761
even if all this goes well, I already...
I'm going to be fucked.

273
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:21,761
Because I'm not gonna see you again.

274
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:25,881
Do you think it was within my plans

275
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,161
to fall in love with the inspector
in charge of the case?

276
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:29,361
I don't want to hear you any more.

277
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:34,641
You don't want to hear me?

278
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:38,641
Why don't you want to hear me, Raquel?

279
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,761
Because l' m one of the bad guys?

280
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:50,041
You've been taught to see everything
in terms of good and bad.

281
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,041
But what we're doing is fine with you

282
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,081
if other people do it.

283
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:57,001
In 2011 the European Central Bank

284
00:25:57,161 --> 00:26:01,441
created 171 billion euros out of nowhere.

285
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,841
Out of nowhere.

286
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,361
Just like we're doing.

287
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,641
Only in a big way.

288
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:12,241
185 000 in 2012.

289
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:15,521
145 billion euros in 2013.

290
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,521
Do you know where all that money went?

291
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:22,121
To the banks.

292
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:27,241
Directly from the factory to the richest.

293
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:33,121
Did anyone say that the European Central Bank

294
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:34,481
was a thief?

295
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,721
Provision of liquidity they called it.

296
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,961
And they got it out of nowhere, Raquel, out of nowhere.

297
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:56,001
What's this?

298
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,521
This is nothing, Raquel, this is paper.

299
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:02,161
It's paper, see?

300
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:04,521
It's paper.

301
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,161
I'm making a provision of liquidity.

302
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,641
But not to the bank, I'm doing it here,

303
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:19,761
in the real economy of this group of unfortunates,

304
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,161
which is who we are, Raquel.

305
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,121
To escape from all this.

306
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,361
Don't you want to escape?

307
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:45,961
Ángel is calling you.

308
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:49,321
What's the meaning of this?
Has he woken up?

309
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:53,121
If he's conscious, he will send the colleagues

310
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:55,321
and they're gonna show up
in five minutes, for fuck's sake.

311
00:27:56,561 --> 00:28:00,321
Okay, all right, you're gonna answer it, Raquel,

312
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:02,841
but no nonsense. Please, please.

313
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:06,641
You're gonna answer and you're gonna make sure

314
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:08,641
if he's awake, okay?

315
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:11,561
Please.

316
00:28:12,681 --> 00:28:13,641
Please.

317
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:16,081
No, don't pick up.

318
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:18,561
Don't pick up.

319
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,161
My phone's bugged.

320
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:27,401
Do you have another one?

321
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:44,041
Who's that?
- Raquel, Raquel Murillo.

322
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:48,921
- Ángel's awake,
he doesn't want us to call anyone

323
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,481
before he talks to you.

324
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:59,241
- Raquel.

325
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:04,881
How's it going?

326
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:11,801
It's okay.

327
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:13,601
Come on.

328
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:16,401
It's okay.

329
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,721
Come on, Raquel.
- How are you?

330
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:24,801
- Me? Like floating. I can't even feel my ass.

331
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:36,321
Listen, I've seen on TV that you've been relieved

332
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:37,761
of the investigation.

333
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,361
- Yes, it is.

334
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:44,641
- Don't tell anyone I woke up, okay?

335
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,601
I need you to come see me first.

336
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:51,881
- Okay.

337
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:01,321
Colonel, we've detected a call
to Raquel Murillo's cell phone,

338
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:03,681
but there's been no communication.

339
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:06,601
- Trace the origin of this call.
I want the holder of the mobile

340
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,841
and the repeater. Now!

341
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:12,201
You have to let me go talk to Ángel.

342
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,641
If not, in 15 minutes he'll talk to the police

343
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,881
and tell them where you are.
And I can stop him from doing it.

344
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,601
It's your only chance. Please.

345
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,601
It's about your plan,
that your perfect plan

346
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:27,001
doesn't get fucked up.
- Let me think, please.

347
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,121
There's nothing to think about, Sergio.

348
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:47,721
I'm with you.

349
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:52,161
A minute ago you were yelling at me
and biting me like an animal.

350
00:30:56,601 --> 00:31:00,361
Can I trust you?
- Come, come closer.

351
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:13,921
Colonel.

352
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:16,801
We have the call to Raquel.

353
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:20,081
It's been done from Ángel's phone.

354
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,561
- What?
- The sub-inspector Rubio.

355
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:33,081
Call to the hospital and find out
if he's awake from the coma.

356
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:35,401
If so, send three men at full throttle.

357
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:38,881
That bitch could show up there any minute.

358
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:48,201
Well, that's it, timers and sensors in place.

359
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:51,481
This'll keep the police entertained for a while,

360
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,361
they' Il have to deactivate them one by one.

361
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:58,801
What's your plan tomorrow?

362
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:01,481
Tomorrow?

363
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:06,521
Tomorrow I'll be sailing in a merchant ship,

364
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:08,521
sunbathing with my tits in the air.

365
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,161
The tits in the air.

366
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,561
So I don't get any marks.

367
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:18,081
And you're gonna be there, naked,

368
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:21,481
with all those lonely sailors who didn't see

369
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,721
a woman for months?

370
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,961
You think I can't defend myself or what?

371
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:30,601
Or do you want to defend me from the voyeurs?

372
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,401
No, it's not that.
- No?

373
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:35,361
That journey is our last journey.

374
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:39,001
And I don't know what the fuck you're gonna
do when we get to port,

375
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,441
I don't know if you're gonna hook up a jet ski

376
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:44,441
or what the hell you're gonna do, I don't know.

377
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:50,081
So I want you to be quiet with me.
And in the cabin.

378
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:55,961
Hey, we just ran into a brick wall.

379
00:33:58,441 --> 00:33:59,401
Hold it.

380
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,641
Open that wall, faces the sewer.

381
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:15,521
That's where we're going out.

382
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:17,161
Go.

383
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,561
Take this.

384
00:34:22,721 --> 00:34:24,321
Have you seen all those bombs?

385
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:27,361
Fucking hell.

386
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:33,281
20 years of my life, 20 years.

387
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,481
Jesús, give me the hammer.

388
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,841
We're 200 meters from the mouth.

389
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,841
Estimated time: six minutes.
- Let's go.

390
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:50,361
We will warn of any seismic movement.

391
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:05,201
Berlín, stop the chain right now.

392
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:08,441
Nairobi, we're leaving.
- There is still money to carry.

393
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:09,961
- We'll be right there with the luggage.

394
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:12,201
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure robbing you,

395
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,961
but it's time to enjoy a well-deserved vacation.

396
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:47,681
Raquel.

397
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,481
- How are you?

398
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:56,121
- You see.

399
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:58,561
- I'm glad you got out of this.

400
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:03,201
I think I owe you an apology.
- Stop apologizing.

401
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:08,401
Although what you called me,
flirt from bingos and Don Pimpón,

402
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:11,201
was the most humiliating thing
I've ever been told in my fucking life.

403
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,321
I couldn't rest easy in the coma.

404
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:18,601
- I'm so sorry.

405
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:24,041
- Why were you relieved of the case?

406
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,961
- Because they think I belong
to that gang of robbers.

407
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,681
- And you belong?

408
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:34,961
- No!

409
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,201
- But you've had a relationship
with that guy, haven't you?

410
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:42,201
- Yes.
- And you're in love with him.

411
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:58,561
I'll give you the information
on where the hangar is.

412
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:02,121
From there that guy controls the whole heist.

413
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,121
In case you want to clean up your reputation,

414
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:09,201
solve the case and beat them.

415
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,361
- I know where that hangar is.

416
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,441
But I'm not going to give them the information.

417
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,041
- Why not?

418
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:26,001
- Because I don't know
who the good guys are

419
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,521
and who the bad guys are anymore.

420
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:31,921
Don't move!
- Hands up!

421
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:43,521
Put your hands up.

422
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:47,681
- López.

423
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,161
Arenas.

424
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,041
Gómez.

425
00:37:58,841 --> 00:37:59,841
Aah!

426
00:38:06,321 --> 00:38:07,441
Ángel...

427
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,401
You know there's gonna be laws
on our island, don't you?

428
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:44,641
You have to go naked all day long,
although I'll be able to wear loincloths.

429
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,601
Go put explosives in the warehouse, go on.

430
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:11,441
Tokio!

431
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,121
Forward!

432
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:33,441
Come on, fuck!

433
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,521
Shit!
Here!

434
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:40,801
Get up!
Aah!

435
00:39:56,881 --> 00:39:57,841
What the fuck do we do?

436
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:06,921
Fucking armored shields.

437
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:08,801
You have to shoot them in the feet.

438
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,241
Cover me!

439
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:23,241
Motherfuckers!

440
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,201
Corporal, count!

441
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:28,281
- They've hit several agents, sir!

442
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:29,401
I'll cover you.

443
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:38,201
We evacuated wounded, come on!
We evacuate the wounded and go forward!

444
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:43,081
If we get out of here,
I'll hang up the machine gun, I swear.

445
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,201
Really?
- I'll never take a shotgun again,

446
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,361
not even at the fair.

447
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:54,441
Come on, everybody!

448
00:40:57,921 --> 00:41:01,041
Besides, we'll have to pick out things
for our island, won't we?

449
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:06,161
Curtains, sofas...
- Did you say our island?

450
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:09,681
Motherfuckers!

451
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:14,041
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
With everything!

452
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:17,521
Fuck. Lobo, now!

453
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:21,881
They're coming. Let's go! Fuck!

454
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,201
Let's go! Let's go!

455
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:25,681
Come on, come on!

456
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:29,721
Come on, come on!

457
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,681
Fucking hell. Let's go.

458
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:36,841
We've got to get to that door.

459
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,001
Hold your fire, don't shoot!

460
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:42,361
Aníbal.
- What?

461
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:45,601
Give me your badge.

462
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:47,241
The engagemt plate?

463
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,641
- One, two... Now.

464
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:52,801
Take cover!

465
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:04,161
I love you.

466
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:09,161
Okay.

467
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:16,041
Tokio!

468
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:20,681
Tokio!

469
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,161
Tokio!

470
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,561
Tokio.
- You're under arrest. Stay still!

471
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,201
Río, Río.
- No, don't shoot!

472
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:35,681
- Get away from her, hands up!

473
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:36,961
- Río, down, down!

474
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:45,561
Shit!

475
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,441
Fucking shit!

476
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:07,921
We're leaving now!

477
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,441
Run, run, run!

478
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:13,401
- Lobo, Ruiz! How are you?

479
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:16,841
Ruiz, for fuck's sake! We evacuated Ruiz!

480
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:20,441
Río, Denver!
What?

481
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,161
Go get the Browning, see you in the vault.

482
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:25,081
Come on!

483
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:32,561
Formation and we'll go on, now!
Come on, let's go get 'em!

484
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,041
Yes, sir.

485
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:40,321
I'll pass it on.

486
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:46,041
CNI has taken over, it's Colonel Prieto.

487
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:48,561
- Ángel, how are you?

488
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:52,161
- Well, I've been better by Christmas to be honest.

489
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:54,841
- Hey, I'm curious, why did you call

490
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:57,121
Inspector Murillo as soon as you woke up?

491
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:59,441
- Because we're friends.

492
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:03,881
- Don't fuck with me.
Come on, tell me, why did she come to see you?

493
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,361
- He came because we're friends.

494
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,561
- She humiliated you like a shitbag
in front of the whole team

495
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:12,481
and almost killed your career and your life,

496
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:15,721
so stop breaking my balls
with the fucking friendship thing.

497
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:19,441
I'm going to repeat the question, Ángel.

498
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:23,041
Why did you call Inspector Murillo?

499
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,721
- Because she's my friend.

500
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:28,881
- You were in the hideout
of that guy, the Profesor,

501
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,241
I know you took a spoon out of his lair

502
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:34,001
and gave it to the scientist for analysis.

503
00:44:34,161 --> 00:44:35,201
Tell us the address.

504
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:37,961
- I don't remember anything.

505
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:41,961
I don't remember a fucking shit.
- Yeah.

506
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,881
You know that any information
you withhold from us

507
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:48,361
will make you commit a cover-up crime,

508
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,401
you might end up sharing a cell
with the kidnappers

509
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:53,921
or with your friend.

510
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:57,681
Tell us the address.

511
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:02,681
- Prieto.

512
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:10,081
You really know how to treat
a guy who just came out of a coma.

513
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:28,921
No one's left behind, let's go!

514
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:35,841
All with masks!

515
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:39,361
They're inside. You have to take the Browning

516
00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:41,961
to vault three.
- Denver is doing it.

517
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:44,201
What do we do with the hostages?
- Hand them over.

518
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:47,081
Everybody disorderly, on your back and knees, now!

519
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:48,761
Come on!

520
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:52,561
Well, not everyone.

521
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,841
Ariadna's coming with me.

522
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,321
Let's go, Helsinki!

523
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:06,961
They're in the museum.

524
00:46:10,721 --> 00:46:12,801
Attention, hands up, where I can see them!

525
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,841
Everybody, hands up!
- Don't shoot, we're hostages!

526
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:17,361
- Everybody, masks, out!

527
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:24,041
They're hostages.

528
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:26,201
- They're hostages, get them out now!

529
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:30,921
- Prepare rescue protocol.
Hostages released.

530
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:34,361
- Suárez, we go on with the plan,
we go to the basement.

531
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:38,321
We have to get them out through the tunnel.
- You two, with them.

532
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:40,561
The rest of you, with me, to the basement!
Let's go, now!

533
00:47:36,961 --> 00:47:38,041
We got Parker.

534
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,161
Get me the ambassador.

535
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:45,121
Have them count and identify the hostages.

536
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:48,121
- Colonel, we're advancing through the basement.

537
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:54,201
Open up.

538
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,721
What the fuck is that?
- Let TEDAX advance,

539
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,561
the basement is full of explosives.
- Bastards.

540
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:17,361
Can you deactivate it?

541
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:21,641
- Yes, but I need time, sir.

542
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:26,481
The detonator may be very close to the RDX,
there may be trapping wires.

543
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:29,561
- My men are detecting movement in the tunnel, sir.

544
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:34,001
- Reaching target.

545
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,921
They're on the other side of the wall.
- Five, five robbers.

546
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:55,601
No, wait, they' re six robbers.

547
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:57,401
- That's them.

548
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:00,081
- They're about to come out of t
he hole into the sewer.

549
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:04,881
- Underground agents, stand by,
they're on top of you.

550
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:06,081
- Received.

551
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:10,241
- We got you, motherfuckers.
- In six seconds.

552
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:14,481
Five, four, three,

553
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:17,961
two, one.

554
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:20,961
- Hold on, hold on.

555
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:23,761
Hang in there.

556
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:28,441
Don't shoot!
- Hands up!

557
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:31,081
Don't shoot, please don't shoot!

558
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:32,201
Turn that light off!

559
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:36,201
Don't shoot, I'm Arturo Román!

560
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,521
They're hostages, don't shoot!

561
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:40,881
- Confirmed, they're hostages.

562
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:43,321
- Fucking hell!

563
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:48,121
I may not always have known
how to understand women,

564
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,641
maybe because I'm egocentric.
But with you it's different,

565
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,321
I know perfectly well the way you feel.

566
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:55,561
I know that even if there was no money,
you'd come with me to the end of the world,

567
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:58,321
because you're completely in love, aren't you?

568
00:49:58,481 --> 00:49:59,441
- Yes.

569
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:02,081
- That's why I want you to know that I love you too.

570
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,321
- Berlín, "presto"!

571
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:08,921
- And the little time remaining, it' s gonna be fireworks.

572
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:28,321
Wonderful little toy.

573
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,441
Wonderful little toy, Helsinki!

574
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:35,081
Nairobi, how's it going?
- The trench is in place,

575
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:38,841
only remains the last batch of money.
Helsinki, come on!

576
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:40,841
- Come, on.

577
00:50:42,241 --> 00:50:44,881
Colonel, they've got another tunnel.

578
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:49,281
- What do you mean?

579
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:51,721
- They're taking the money to the vault.

580
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:52,921
We've seen it.

581
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:55,681
They've made a hole in the ground
and they get everything out there.

582
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:56,961
Come closer.

583
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:03,641
There are four vaults,
two on either side of the corridor,

584
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:06,401
would you tell me which one it is,
could you point it out on the map?

585
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:12,201
- Vault number three.

586
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:14,961
- Are you sure, Alison?

587
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:19,441
- Yes.

588
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:22,241
- Suárez, Suárez, do you receive me?
- I copy, sir.

589
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:24,241
- Change of plan, vault three,

590
00:51:24,401 --> 00:51:26,561
top priority. Repeat, top priority,

591
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:28,681
they've got the tunnel there.
- Received, colonel.

592
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:31,641
To vault three, come on, come on, come on, come on!

593
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:34,081
Do you have any idea where that tunnel ends?

594
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:37,601
- They don't know it, but I do.
They're going to take the money to the hangar

595
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,601
from where the fucking Profesor speaks.

596
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:42,201
And they're thinking of escaping that way.

597
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:46,761
Have Inspector Murillo brought in now!

598
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:51,281
- Gómez, we need Inspector Murillo here now,

599
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,401
immediately.

600
00:51:57,601 --> 00:51:59,401
Are you gonna go after your son when you get out?

601
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:02,121
- No, not yet.

602
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:05,001
I've run out of plan.

603
00:52:09,281 --> 00:52:10,601
- We can share a flat.

604
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:13,761
- Helsinki

605
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,201
Let's go now, now!
- They're in the basement.

606
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:21,121
Come on, come on, get out now!
- And Denver?

607
00:52:21,281 --> 00:52:23,441
They're on their way to the hangar.
I said get out.

608
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:26,401
That's an order.

609
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:39,401
- Berlín, let's go.

610
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:57,961
Berlín, they're coming down the stairs,
they're all over you.

611
00:52:58,121 --> 00:52:59,201
Okay, heard.

612
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:03,401
You know where we are, go away.
- Let's go now or we won't go out anymore.

613
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:05,761
- Helsinki, take Nairobi. I resist.

614
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:08,201
- What do you mean?
- I said go out!

615
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:10,521
If they go into the tunnel, we're all dead.

616
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,001
What are you doing, Berlín?
- Someone has to stay

617
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,161
in the trench.
- No.

618
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:22,521
- Yeah, they're on our heels!
- Well, we're all leaving together!

619
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:23,641
- Nairobi

620
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:27,681
You and I agreed that I was
a male chauvinist, didn't we?

621
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:33,201
Well, women and faggots first.

622
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:35,041
- Let's go.
- I hate you.

623
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:36,161
- Let's go.

624
00:53:37,161 --> 00:53:38,201
- I hate you! I hate you!

625
00:53:40,961 --> 00:53:43,681
Come on, come on.
I want each of you in your place, let's go.

626
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:49,961
Hey, hey.

627
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:54,801
Where are you going, honey?

628
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,441
We had agreed that you and I,
here, together until the end.

629
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:00,601
- No!

630
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:03,161
Berlín, please.

631
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:06,601
No, no. Let me out, let me out!

632
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:08,561
Fuck, let me out!

633
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,041
- Don't move!
- You bastard!

634
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:13,441
Motherfucker, motherfucker!

635
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:19,601
- You and I are the resistance.

636
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:40,361
It's a shame to see you.

637
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,721
Where's the hangar?

638
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:50,401
- I don't know.

639
00:54:51,801 --> 00:54:54,641
- Not only does you know where the hangar is,
but you know perfectly well

640
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:57,241
I know you know, so let's save this part.

641
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:21,961
Big caliber, take cover!

642
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:32,201
We have to go back.
- No, Nairobi, no.

643
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:34,201
There's no time, let's go, come on.

644
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:37,081
Ariadna, charge!

645
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:39,361
Charge!
- Now!

646
00:55:44,561 --> 00:55:45,521
Let's go!

647
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:59,481
This is a custody claim lawsuit.

648
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:04,441
And it was presented by the hero of the case,

649
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,241
the policeman who managed to identify

650
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:08,681
the brain of the operation.

651
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:10,761
Your ex-husband.

652
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:14,881
Hold on, hold on!

653
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:19,561
Charge!
- Now!

654
00:56:23,961 --> 00:56:26,801
We're Romeo and Juliet, we're Bonnie and Clyde!

655
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:29,561
We are the lovers of Teruel!

656
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,521
He's applying for full custody of your daughter.

657
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:38,601
And the moment a judge finds you guilty

658
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:41,161
of any of the charges you are charged with,

659
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:43,641
it will automatically be granted.

660
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:47,121
And if your ex-husband is an abuser,
as you claim,

661
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:49,081
your daughter has a problem.

662
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,561
Charge!
- Now!

663
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:05,601
Son of a bitch, you son of a bitch,
you fucking bastard.

664
00:57:06,921 --> 00:57:09,201
- Intelligence can drop all your charges.

665
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:13,161
And I'm Intelligence.
But don't ask me for more guarantees

666
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:15,401
than my word, because
the offer will disappear

667
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:17,521
if the kidnappers manage to escape.

668
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:21,321
And that can happen in a few minutes.

669
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,041
Come on, let's go!

670
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:33,681
So choose, or your daughter

671
00:57:34,561 --> 00:57:37,001
or a guy you didn't know a week ago.

672
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:45,481
Lobo, we can't stop that machine gun,

673
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:47,001
that position must be lowered!

674
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:49,281
Grenade!

675
00:57:53,521 --> 00:57:55,041
Charge!
- Now!

676
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:57,521
Take cover!

677
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:01,161
- Now, we're going!

678
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:04,121
Come on, move, jump!

679
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:07,321
Take cover!

680
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:20,041
You're here, you're here.

681
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:23,681
Where's Berlín?
- He has remained inside.

682
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:30,761
What do you mean, he's inside?
- We had the GEOS on top of us

683
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:32,601
and he has insisted on covering the tunnel.

684
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:36,081
- He saved our lives.

685
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:42,601
We're clear. Formation.

686
00:59:05,321 --> 00:59:06,921
- Surprise!

687
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:25,921
You don't have much time left.

688
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:28,801
Raquel, not only are you going
to lose your daughter,

689
00:59:28,961 --> 00:59:30,681
you' re gonna throw your whole life away.

690
00:59:30,841 --> 00:59:32,201
Tell me that address.

691
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:37,081
Tell me that address!

692
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:41,281
- Alcántara, 33.

693
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,801
- Alcántara, 33!
I want everybody there!

694
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:00,161
Andrés?

695
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:05,561
Andrés.
- Profesor.

696
01:00:08,961 --> 01:00:11,081
Right now you're catching me a little busy.

697
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:16,641
Get in the tunnel.

698
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:19,561
Negative!

699
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:25,721
Andrés, we're going to blow the tunnel,
you have to get out of there.

700
01:00:27,281 --> 01:00:29,441
They're on me, it's late.
- Forward!

701
01:00:30,881 --> 01:00:31,961
- Go now!

702
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:36,801
I'm not leaving here without you, you know that.

703
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:38,641
Charger.

704
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:45,401
Decadence is not meant for me.

705
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:51,201
Can you imagine me drooling or losing control

706
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:52,401
of my sphincters?

707
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:56,121
No, it takes courage to do that. I prefer this.

708
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:03,441
Come out, please.
- Sergio, don't screw me!

709
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:06,401
You promised me you wouldn't stay if things got ugly.

710
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:07,641
And they've gotten ugly.

711
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:12,521
Helsinki, blow the tunnel.

712
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:15,561
No, no.

713
01:01:19,201 --> 01:01:20,161
Get down! Get down!

714
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:23,201
Helsinki, that's an order!
Soldier, blow the tunnel!

715
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:25,521
No, don't.

716
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:28,561
Helsinki, that's an order!
Soldier, blow the tunnel!

717
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:31,001
No, no, Helsinki, no!

718
01:01:31,361 --> 01:01:34,041
I love you so much,
little brother, don't forget it.

719
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:35,561
- No, Profesor, no!

720
01:01:38,201 --> 01:01:40,201
Don't do it, Helsinki! Andrés!

721
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,281
Ari, Ari.

722
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:46,801
Andrés, please!

723
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:49,281
I've spent my life being a little bit
of a son of a bitch,

724
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:50,441
but hey...

725
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:55,441
I think I want to die with dignity.

726
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:04,761
Fire, with everything!

727
01:02:18,521 --> 01:02:19,561
Andrés.

728
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:35,601
Open up!

729
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:53,041
Fonollosa down.
Repeat, Fonollosa down.

730
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:16,401
Profesor, listen to me.

731
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:20,401
Let's keep going.

732
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:23,041
Let's keep going.

733
01:03:25,841 --> 01:03:26,801
Let's keep going.

734
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:33,441
Colonel, units on their way to Alcántara, 33.

735
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,041
300 meters from target.

736
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:43,321
Change your clothes.

737
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:00,441
Entering Alcántara Street.
Colonel, reaching the target.

738
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,201
We're inside the hangar.

739
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:27,361
Let's comb the area.
Velero and Sanz on the left.

740
01:04:27,521 --> 01:04:28,481
Rivero, with me.

741
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:31,241
Velero?
- Clear.

742
01:04:34,721 --> 01:04:36,001
- Sanz?
- Clear.

743
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:41,001
- Rivero?
- Clear.

744
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:52,561
Confirmed, Colonel, there's no one here.

745
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:55,241
The hangar's empty.

746
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:14,441
Profesor.

747
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:18,921
Profesor!

748
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:21,401
Aah! Aah!

749
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:33,121
One year has passed since the assault on the
Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

750
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:36,121
The one considered as the biggest robbery

751
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:38,361
of history is still unresolved.

752
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,361
Just as the whereabouts
of the kidnappers are unknown,

753
01:07:41,521 --> 01:07:45,001
that were made with a loot
of more than a billion euros.

754
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,281
Although, of course,
the forces of law and order

755
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:50,121
condemned the heist,
a large part of public opinion

756
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:52,681
continues to see in their
performance a legitimate act,

757
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:55,681
a form of protest
against the established order,

758
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:58,401
generating an intense
debate on social networks.

759
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:01,241
One of the most publicized cases
was that of the inspector in charge

760
01:08:01,401 --> 01:08:03,961
those days, Raquel Murillo, who left the police

761
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,081
after some controversial statements

762
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:08,641
to the media in which
she showed her disagreement.

763
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:11,481
with crisis management
by the National Corps

764
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:12,601
of Intelligence.

765
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:16,561
Let's go,

766
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:18,921
you and I are going to a Caribbean country.

767
01:08:19,081 --> 01:08:21,401
But are you crazy or what?

768
01:08:23,161 --> 01:08:24,961
I can't imagine doing anything else.

769
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,521
Pick one.

770
01:08:30,601 --> 01:08:31,561
Palawan.

771
01:11:00,001 --> 01:11:02,081
If it's important,

772
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:07,841
you can use mine.
