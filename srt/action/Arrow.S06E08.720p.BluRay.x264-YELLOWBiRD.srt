1
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:10,921
Oh, my God...

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,177
Oh, my God what? Who is that?

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,182
That's Tommy Merlyn.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,185
He died over four years ago.

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,101
Oliver, who's Tommy Merlyn?

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,519
Thea's other brother.

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,028
And my best friend.

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,207
We're gonna need a moment alone.

9
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,342
He's a crony.

10
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,504
- Anachronism.
- That's what I said.

11
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,554
Lately, we've been dealing
with Anachronisms.

12
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,304
It's people and things
displaced throughout time.

13
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,762
Okay, but why would Nazis from 1945
want to crash my wedding?

14
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,598
Crab legs. They were delicious.

15
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,191
Well, Iris has a point though.

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,317
If they're out of time,
they would have targeted

17
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,066
the military or law enforcement.

18
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,856
Tommy was plucked from five years ago
and put in the Prometheus wardrobe.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,940
That doesn't make any sense.

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,321
It does if we're not dealing
with an Anachronism.

21
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,911
Visitors from another Earth?

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,196
What, there are more than one?

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,156
There are 52, actually.

24
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,793
Though I'm hard-pressed to think
of one where Nazis are ascendant.

25
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:27,952
I can.

26
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,750
There's a 53rd Earth.

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,211
And it's called Earth-X.

28
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,179
It doesn't have a designation

29
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,809
because it's a place so awful,

30
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,061
so horrific,

31
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,609
no sane person
would ever travel there.

32
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,604
It's basically our Earth,

33
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,940
same history, same timeline with

34
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,951
one crucial and critical difference.

35
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>Let me hypothesize.</i>

36
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,411
The Nazis developed the atomic bomb
before the United States did

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,866
and they were more than happy
to use it?

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,043
Yes. The Nazis won the war.

39
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,501
And New York, London, Paris
and Moscow were all obliterated.

40
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,925
The SS set up outposts not only
all throughout Europe

41
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,798
<i>but also all throughout the Americas,</i>

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,847
and Hitler continued his brutal reign,

43
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,593
aided by prime ministers
and presidents sympathetic to him,

44
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,059
until his death

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,016
in 1994.

46
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,474
Now they're not happy ruling
just one Earth.

47
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,648
God, this is making me
physically ill.

48
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,399
Yeah, line starts behind me.

49
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,777
We have to find them.

50
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,072
I mean, do you think they're using
the breach to hop between worlds?

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,154
That, or they're operating
from a staging area,

52
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,909
somewhere in Central City
or close by.

53
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,916
Well, good thing we have a metric ton
of smart people in this building.

54
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,208
And Rory.

55
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,545
Let's get to work on finding
our new friends from Earth-X.

56
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,707
- Earth-X.
- That's right.

57
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,920
And I'm dead on this Earth?

58
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,176
That's right.

59
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,099
I'd almost prefer that.

60
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,349
I was born into the Reich.

61
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,019
The whole world is the Fatherland.

62
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,352
We don't have elementary schools
and summer camps.

63
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,062
We have youth groups

64
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,151
and military training.

65
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,780
We all grow up without choice.

66
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,323
You have a choice now.

67
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,665
You can tell me where to find
the others from Earth-X.

68
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,999
On my Earth, you are my best friend.

69
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,375
I would die for you.

70
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,628
I would have died for you.

71
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,097
- "Would have"?
- You beat me to it.

72
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,929
I lost you. It was like...

73
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,103
It was like losing a limb and...

74
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,687
You weren't just my best friend.

75
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,523
Tommy, you were my brother

76
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,357
and you sacrificed yourself
for a woman that we both loved

77
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,568
and I was there
and I had you right here.

78
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,084
You were a good man here.

79
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,664
And I believe
that you still can be.

80
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,083
No, you don't understand.
If I talk...

81
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,089
If I break, the FÃ¼hrer will kill

82
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,056
my father. He'll kill my mother.
Everyone that I love...

83
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,303
I will not let that happen.

84
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,177
I will stop him.

85
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,015
Do you think you can do that?

86
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,483
I promise you that I can do that.

87
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,489
Then you really are
a special kind of idiot.

88
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,164
Your naivete would be charming

89
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,002
if your weakness wasn't so pathetic.

90
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,792
Is this how it is on your planet?

91
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,170
Everybody's swayed by sentiment?

92
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:10,053
Is everyone here really so weak?

93
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,970
The Reich will change that.

94
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,309
<i>The weak will be eliminated.</i>

95
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,767
Your entire world will be enslaved.
But you, you...

96
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,275
You won't be around
to witness it.

97
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,819
He is going to feel your skull crack

98
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,868
under the weight of his boot.
Everyone you care about,

99
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,332
<i>everyone you love,</i>

100
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,581
they're gonna die badly.

101
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:47,008
In ways that would give
even monsters nightmares.

102
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,349
I really wish that I
could live to see it.

103
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,646
No! Tommy, don't!

104
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,221
He's gone.

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,767
Who? Merlyn?

106
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,150
The biosensor in his suit indicates
his heart stopped.

107
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,028
He always seemed kinda soft to me.

108
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,157
- Oliver...
- He died for you.

109
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,907
And we will make
his death worthwhile.

110
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,752
That doesn't change the fact
that now we're down a man.

111
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,872
Keep your focus where it belongs.

112
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,549
And get to work on locating
that Prism.

113
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,717
Watch your tone.

114
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,553
Or I'll watch it for you.

115
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,349
Oliver!

116
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,900
Did you just tell me
to watch my tone?

117
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,942
You're angry...

118
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,407
- And I like it.
- Don't you mock me.

119
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,610
Don't threaten me.

120
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,653
Or have you forgotten...

121
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,246
I could end your life
before you birth your next thought.

122
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:47,541
Try it, once I break
every bone in your body.

123
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,375
Okay.

124
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,680
We're all a little emotional.
Here's what I suggest.

125
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,725
I will stop vibrating my hand,

126
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,350
you stop breaking my wrist,
and you...

127
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,105
Be 10% less brooding.

128
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,737
We accomplish nothing by arguing
amongst ourselves.

129
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,198
It's the accomplishing nothing
that has me concerned.

130
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,750
We came here to conquer this Earth,
or have you forgotten?

131
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,998
Locate the Prism.

132
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,539
Please.

133
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,585
Once we have identified
the location of the target,

134
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,966
I will devise a plan of attack.

135
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,558
I'm sorry about Merlyn.

136
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,607
He should've died in the church

137
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,434
before he allowed himself
to be captured.

138
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,897
Kara, we need that Prism.
We are running out of time.

139
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,983
You have to trust
in the plan, Oliver.

140
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,577
You should. It's yours.

141
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,326
And do you trust me?

142
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,795
Yes, with all of my heart.

143
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,472
<i>You're kidding me?
Are you kidding me?</i>

144
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,265
<i>This feels like a really bad
wedding prank.</i>

145
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,343
- No, I wish.
<i>- Do you want us to come there?</i>

146
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,599
<i>I mean, Digg's on the mend
but Dinah, Rene, and I</i>

147
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,897
<i>can be up there in a...
What's another word for "flash"?</i>

148
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,099
No, I need you guys in the bunker,

149
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,855
expanding our search
for the Earth-Xers.

150
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,857
I linked S.T.A.R. Labs' system
up with ours

151
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,482
so you can know what's going on
as we do.

152
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,649
<i>Copy that.
I will get to work on hacking</i>

153
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,953
<i>Palmer Tech's spectrometers
to help the search for Nazis.</i>

154
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,237
See you soon.

155
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,668
Hey, Caitlin and Wells are trying
to track down the Earth-Xers

156
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,838
using some sort of
dimensional something.

157
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,039
Vibrations.

158
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,543
I told Curtis to do the same thing
with quantum field analysis.

159
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,719
- I'm sorry about Tommy.
- That wasn't Tommy.

160
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,719
He said that they are trying
to mount some sort of invasion.

161
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,679
I guess the silver lining
to Black Siren

162
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,810
is that we have experience
with doppelgangers.

163
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,525
So, if it's not Tommy I'm reading
on your face, what's up?

164
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,030
You know what it is.

165
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,535
Well, maybe we should wait
until we repel invaders

166
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,034
from another Earth
to have this conversation.

167
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,332
Remember when we got back from Ivy Town?
Do you remember Ivy Town?

168
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,659
Mmm. So fondly.

169
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,962
When we got back,
you said that we could do this

170
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,337
and we could still have our lives.

171
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,461
- That was you.
- Yeah.

172
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,758
So, um...

173
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,341
This impending invasion
notwithstanding,

174
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,013
may we take two minutes
and talk about this?

175
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,891
Yeah.

176
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,404
So maybe what wasn't fair was me
saying I didn't want to marry you.

177
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,735
I mean, not the way I did.

178
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,695
Not with the most terrible timing
in the world.

179
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,121
Well, was it how I said it?

180
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,166
Because I know that it was really...
I mean, it was spontaneous.

181
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,584
It was so lovely.

182
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,870
It was so sweet.

183
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,171
I love you.

184
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,752
I just don't want to be married.
I don't...

185
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,380
Want to be married to anyone.

186
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,965
You didn't feel that way when we got
engaged two years ago.

187
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,052
Right, and then 10 minutes later,
I got shot and paralyzed.

188
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,975
Barry and Iris have a wedding
and Nazis crash it.

189
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,055
You didn't know that was going
to happen

190
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,482
when you said you didn't want
to marry me.

191
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,275
My point is...

192
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,937
We have something so good.

193
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,023
We have something so great going.

194
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,743
Let's not change that.
Let's just stand pat

195
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,991
with the cards that we're holding.

196
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,617
I want to move forward.

197
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,953
Felicity, I love you

198
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,374
and I want to marry you.

199
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,043
I love you.

200
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,501
I love you. I will always,

201
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,758
always, always love you.

202
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,220
Please respect me on this.

203
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,017
Okay.

204
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,190
Thank you.

205
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,162
Felicity's got her friend working

206
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,740
on Palmer Technologies'
spectrometry satellites...

207
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,994
Okay, but what about the <i>Waverider?</i>

208
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,917
I mean, a time traveling space ship
must have some sort of

209
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,460
tracking technology that we can use.

210
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,914
Yeah, not exactly.
It's in the Stone Age.

211
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,880
Like, literally in the Stone Age.

212
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,260
Okay, well, Parallel Earth jumping
is kind of Cisco's specialty.

213
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,932
Well, since he's so busy being
unconscious right now, I guess

214
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,468
we're on our own.

215
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,264
Oh, perfect timing, man.

216
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,767
We're trying to find the guys
from Earth-X and

217
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,973
we're coming up with nothing.

218
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,775
I'm sorry. Would you excuse us
for a moment?

219
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,816
Happily.

220
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,442
We don't wanna step on whatever...

221
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,116
- Come on, Harry. It's not about you.
- ...awkward, awkward thing that is.

222
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,737
Grey, we got Nazis
from a parallel Earth running around.

223
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,618
- We don't have time...
- Which is precisely why

224
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,826
we cannot afford to be at odds
with each other right now.

225
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,162
I hardly need a psychic connection
to know that you're upset with me.

226
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,543
- But I could stand to know why.
- Just forget about it, man.

227
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,876
It would make some sense if my
decision to be with my family

228
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,087
forced you to leave the <i>Waverider.</i>

229
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,720
But I accounted for that variable
and yet you're still upset.

230
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,017
- You just don't get it...
- No, I don't get it.

231
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,105
My retirement requires you
to give up nothing.

232
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,024
It requires me to give up you, Grey.

233
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,686
Look, I thought I made
my peace with it.

234
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,240
I thought, okay, fine,
I'll stay on the <i>Waverider.</i>

235
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,319
Maybe I can't be Firestorm,
but I can still be a Legend.

236
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,324
But then it hit me.

237
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:56,242
I still can't be Firestorm,
and I can't be a Legend with you.

238
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,788
I never knew my father.

239
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,582
But I got to know you.

240
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,591
You're the closest thing
I've got to a dad, and...

241
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,011
Now you're leaving.

242
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,107
Hey.

243
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,436
- Hey.
- How are you?

244
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,236
Well, punching Nazis.

245
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,031
That was definitely as satisfying
as I imagined it would be.

246
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,985
You okay?

247
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,534
Yeah. Oh, me?
No, I'm okay.

248
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,705
I'm completely okay.

249
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,658
- I'm okay, okay. Okay.
- Okay.

250
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,247
Okay.

251
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,168
This isn't going to be
a thing, right?

252
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,716
Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm okay, I'm good.

253
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,546
Hey, I was looking for you.

254
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,472
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

255
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,015
Why is everybody asking me
that question?

256
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:58,350
Well, you sort of look like
you just killed someone's puppy.

257
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,391
Uh, no. I'm fine.

258
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,649
It's just this whole thing
with Sara.

259
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,819
God, it was a mistake.

260
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,776
A mistake? But...

261
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,905
You came here to have fun
at a wedding and...

262
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,908
Okay, Nazi invaders aside,
you had a good time, right?

263
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,993
No. I mean,
this was all kinds of wrong.

264
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,629
Waking up with a strange woman
in a strange bed?

265
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,958
I have never had
a one night stand before.

266
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,301
And this whole thing is just...

267
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,340
It's got me spinning.

268
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,678
Kara, I mean, what...

269
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,386
What if I made a huge mistake?

270
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,012
- No...
- Okay, no, no, no. I mean, look,

271
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,470
I know, I wanna have kids.

272
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,436
But Maggie was real.

273
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,892
I mean, what we had, that was real.

274
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,943
And now, with everything,
I just...

275
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,489
I chose to let her go.
I chose that.

276
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,570
I mean, what was I thinking?

277
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,747
Alex, Maggie was amazing.

278
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,917
And you two were amazing together
but the best part about her

279
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,170
was that she showed you
how to be true to yourself.

280
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,506
You want kids. She doesn't.

281
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,007
You just had to do
what was right for you.

282
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,472
What if I was wrong?

283
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,063
How long till you brainiacs
find these Nazis?

284
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,820
My answer hasn't changed in the two
minutes since you last asked me.

285
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,735
Sorry.

286
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,901
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

287
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,579
Dealing with some Oliver stuff.

288
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:45,707
Not "Nazis ruined the happiest day
of our life" stuff, but stuff.

289
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,041
Stuff like, "You don't want
to marry him" stuff?

290
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,299
You might've said it a little loudly
at the rehearsal dinner.

291
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,470
What happened?
I thought at the salon,

292
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,638
you said you guys were good.

293
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,808
We are good. We're great.
We're just as...

294
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,845
We're just as good as we were
the last time we got engaged

295
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,055
and I got shot.

296
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,526
That was the beginning
of the end for us.

297
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,441
I don't want to tempt fate again.
You know?

298
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,413
Break-in at Dayton Optical Systems.

299
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,202
I know this sounds terrible,

300
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,749
but maybe we should let the police
handle it.

301
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,373
I mean, we need our peeps
to focus on the Nazis.

302
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,167
- This is Nazis.
- How do you know?

303
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,337
I'll go get Barry.

304
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,669
Yeah, okay.

305
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,444
Just a quick reminder.

306
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,153
Super-speed.

307
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,868
I don't have it.

308
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,911
Noted.

309
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,127
So, what do we know about this place?

310
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,204
Why are the Earth-Xers targeting it?

311
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,713
<i>Because...</i>

312
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,628
They had something we need.

313
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,550
Whatever you stole...

314
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,850
We're gonna want it back.

315
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,394
Your confidence is predictable.

316
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,477
You've faced some of the greatest
evils known to man.

317
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,100
And you've defeated them.

318
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,480
<i>But if you think so highly
of yourselves,</i>

319
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,732
that you can defeat any threat

320
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,688
that comes your way...

321
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,620
How do you feel about us?

322
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,001
This is sick.

323
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,428
To be looking at your reflection
and seeing only weakness?

324
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,468
I agree.

325
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,719
- Thawne.
- Direct from Earth-1.

326
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,846
Do you like my face?

327
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,769
It's the face you were wearing
when I became the Flash.

328
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,066
I thought I'd put it on again.

329
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,613
You know, for old times' sake.
Plus, handsome.

330
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,731
- I watched you die.
- Or did you?

331
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,859
It's time travel, Barry.

332
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,617
So very confusing. I always seem
to be saying that to you, don't I?

333
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,744
Tommy killed himself.

334
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,700
I heard your Tommy died years ago.

335
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,585
That's what this Earth does.

336
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,380
Makes people soft.

337
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,503
We've been watching you.

338
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,585
<i>We've been watching all of you.</i>

339
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,385
And how you've squandered
the potential of two worlds.

340
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,301
On our Earth, we've developed
a meritocracy.

341
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,848
We've accomplished greatness.

342
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,225
You're perverse.

343
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,602
No, Kara, you're the perversion.

344
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,186
The most powerful being
on the planet

345
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,273
rendered weak by
saccharine Americana.

346
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,618
My pod was blessed to crash
in the Fatherland.

347
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,785
Then go back there.

348
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,908
This is not your Earth.

349
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,618
Leave.

350
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,325
I don't answer to the likes of you.

351
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,126
My allegiance is to the Fatherland
and to my wife.

352
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,420
His wife? Gross.

353
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,338
No offense.

354
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,887
Last chance.

355
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,763
Go home.

356
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,966
And stay there.

357
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,258
All of you.

358
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,062
And what do you think
that's going to do?

359
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,893
Bullets bounce off of me.

360
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,441
No, this arrow won't.

361
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,454
Is that a Kryptonite arrow?

362
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,629
Why do you have a Kryptonite arrow?

363
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,958
In case an evil you ever showed up.

364
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,145
Get the Prism out of here.

365
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,232
- Are you all right?
- I'm pissed.

366
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,360
Take it out on that.

367
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,752
It's gonna fall.

368
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,000
All right, get me over there.

369
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,353
Get the workers to safety!

370
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,403
We need to stabilize the building.

371
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,149
- Site's clear.
- And stabilized.

372
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,227
- Nice work.
- Let's not celebrate just yet.

373
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,733
We gave those doppelgangers
the window they needed to escape.

374
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,939
<i>Escape with what?</i>

375
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,568
Dayton Optical Systems
calls it "the Prism."

376
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,868
What on Earth do they need
a sub-light generator for?

377
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,240
It's basically a spectral emitter...

378
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,787
Which uses quantum entanglement.

379
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,491
They could also use it to create
a stable fusion reaction.

380
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,834
Okay, which all means what?

381
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,666
No, guys, really, I'd like to know
what you're talking about.

382
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,840
You got this.

383
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,930
Well, basically the device they stole
can be converted into a neutron bomb.

384
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,006
Boom...

385
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,716
I take it back.

386
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,847
The bottom line is
that we have to catch

387
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,473
these parallel Earth goose-steppers.

388
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,680
This might help.

389
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,273
Is that a Kryptonite arrow?

390
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,566
- Yup.
- I know I shouldn't have to ask

391
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,813
this question, but I have to ask
this question.

392
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,021
- Oliver didn't shoot Kara, did he?
- Sort of.

393
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:32,113
The other archer and flying woman
are Oliver and Kara of Earth-X.

394
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,403
When you said that Earth-X
was "horrible,"

395
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,532
you might've been under-sold it.

396
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,956
Wait a minute.
How could there be another Kara?

397
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,283
There are 53 Karas.

398
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,502
Just like there's 53 Kryptons
and 53 Earths.

399
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,043
And the Thawne from our Earth
is working with them.

400
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,669
He's an idiot.

401
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,175
If that arrow has Not-So-
Supergirl's blood on it...

402
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,924
We could track it using
quantum analysis.

403
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,050
- We could.
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>

404
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,676
<i>I think I might have a quicker way.</i>

405
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,271
These red blood cells are suffused
with short-wave radiation.

406
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,349
- Solar radiation?
- Yeah. Incredibly high amounts.

407
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,728
Like nothing I've ever seen.

408
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,808
Can you track it?

409
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,819
Well, I once caught a deranged serial
killer off his face cream, so...

410
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,277
- No joke.
- Let's just do it. Fast.

411
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,529
Okay.

412
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,493
Will it work?

413
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,790
It will.

414
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,081
With a few adjustments.

415
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,834
And a significant power source.

416
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,257
My husband's on his way
to handle that as we speak.

417
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,836
Your husband has a choice to make.

418
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,304
Me or the Reich?

419
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:35,964
That's right.

420
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,516
Because we have two goals.

421
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,680
And my worry is,

422
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,807
if we can't accomplish them both,
he's gonna choose you

423
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,855
over a second Earth flying
under our banner.

424
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,235
Oliver will not abandon our mission.

425
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,566
I've seen this before in 1945.

426
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,868
Hitler and his men
were equally short-sighted.

427
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,573
Hitler was driven by passion
and childish need.

428
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,124
Oliver is 10 times
the man Hitler ever was.

429
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,873
Not when he's blinded
by his love for you.

430
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,918
If it comes to Oliver choosing
between me and the Reich,

431
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,463
I'll make sure he chooses
the Fatherland.

432
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,681
- How?
- If it comes to it,

433
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,264
by taking the choice
out of his hands.

434
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,142
Maybe tracking her off of face cream
would have been easier.

435
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,817
Supergirl-X's blood

436
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,987
is filled with solar radiation,
more than it should be.

437
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,942
But if I can try to get that to act
as a kind of beacon...

438
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,610
Hey, um...

439
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,243
- How do you do it?
- Do what, Rory?

440
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,916
Bring the other you out of you.

441
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,003
- You don't wanna know.
- Sure I do.

442
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,504
It happens when I'm scared or angry.

443
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,513
So, if I were to, um... Boo!

444
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,845
Nice try.

445
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,768
Boom.

446
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,853
Whatever's going on
with Kara-X's blood,

447
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,101
- it's intensifying.
- Worse for her is better for us.

448
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,683
Better for us for tracking her,
at least.

449
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,234
We should have her location
any minute.

450
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,493
I can't believe he's back.

451
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,788
I don't know if I'll ever be
rid of him.

452
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,657
I know.

453
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,334
I know how much you're hurting.

454
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,586
I just keep looking for closure

455
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,797
but every time I see him,
all I see is...

456
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:33,919
Your mother dying.

457
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,631
You're going to stop him.

458
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,971
- How do you know?
- Because you always do.

459
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,728
And because we're not going
to let you do it alone.

460
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,898
Getting close on a location.

461
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,524
Look, guys. I'm sorry. This is not
how this week was supposed to go.

462
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,063
We can't think about that right now.

463
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:01,572
You should. We fight to protect
the people that we love,

464
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,779
so you guys, recognize what you have.

465
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,665
Recognize it and cherish it
and let it make you stronger.

466
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,583
'Cause if you do that,

467
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,495
you'll always find
your way back to one another.

468
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,921
It's the same for you
and Felicity, man.

469
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,467
I don't know, Barry. I...

470
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,384
She told me she doesn't believe
in marriage.

471
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,016
I'm not feeling sorry for myself,
I just...

472
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,887
I think that if she loved me
the way I loved her,

473
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,097
she would wanna marry me.

474
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,147
Oliver, I've known Felicity
for five years.

475
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,692
And I'm here to tell you,
as sure as I'm standing here,

476
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,861
- she loves you.
- Felicity...

477
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,904
- I appreciate that, guys.
- Just turn.

478
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,573
She's right there.

479
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,200
We got 'em.

480
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,323
They're at a shipping depot
outside Danville.

481
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,406
All right. We'll get the band
back together.

482
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,535
Yeah.

483
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,376
- Oliver...
- It's okay.

484
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,754
We can talk when I'm back.

485
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,253
Right now I need to have my head
in the game.

486
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,755
Get your head in the game.

487
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,270
Supergirl and Firestorm
are sweeping the perimeter.

488
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,731
It's done.
It's wall-to-wall Nazis in there.

489
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,401
Alex and I will take up breach
positions on the northwest corner.

490
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,948
If that's okay with you?

491
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,825
S.T.A.R. Labs thinks they converted
the sub-light generator,

492
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,124
the Prism that they've stolen,
into some kind of super-weapon.

493
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,001
Speaking of "super,"
theirs is our biggest threat.

494
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,579
Agreed. Let's take her out first.

495
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,169
Hey.

496
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,139
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

497
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,469
Yeah.

498
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,600
No.

499
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,561
- You know?
- Yeah.

500
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,645
It's gonna be okay.

501
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,985
Mustard. You people have breaches
but no mustard.

502
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,736
Um, what are you even doing here?

503
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,287
Yeah, why didn't you go with them?

504
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,618
Go where?

505
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,747
<i>Halt!</i>

506
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,388
Couldn't have left one for me?

507
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,140
I'm saving Nazi you for you.

508
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,717
There's no sign of the Prism.

509
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,594
Well, it's gotta be here somewhere.

510
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,145
We got incoming.

511
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,565
Stay where you are!

512
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,498
I see...

513
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,004
Their Flash, their Supergirl.

514
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,182
Yeah, I see them.

515
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,391
Where's their Arrow?

516
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,451
It was in the fridge.

517
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,621
- Did you check the fridge?
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

518
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,456
Any word from the team?

519
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,088
No, they're at the shipping depot
but it's just radio silence.

520
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,598
Oh, God.

521
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,471
There is no God.

522
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,528
You and you, hide.

523
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,026
What about Caitlin?

524
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,654
It's gonna get a lot colder in here.

525
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,215
Burn.

526
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,577
Afraid of a little heat?

527
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,460
No.

528
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,998
I'm afraid of nothing.

529
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,553
Bet you're pretty angry
and scared right now!

530
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,552
I told you. I don't fear anything.

531
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,091
<i>Actually...</i>

532
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,595
He was talking about me.

533
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,980
Didn't think this through, did you?

534
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,350
Just you. Against us.

535
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,565
I don't need to think to kill you.

536
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,110
Anyone else want to be a hero?

537
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,334
They wanted to wait,

538
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,753
but I don't think we'll ever get
a better entry line than that.

539
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,425
Thanks.

540
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,521
What the hell is that?

541
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,779
Metallo.

542
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,722
Hate to do this
to that handsome face but...

543
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,901
Is everyone all right?

544
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,866
We're gonna have to work on your
definition of "all right," Oliver.

545
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,868
Yo, Grey, you good?

546
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,704
It seems my "retirement"
was somewhat tardy.

547
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,917
Well...

548
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,586
Here we are.

549
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,597
This is fun for me.

550
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,517
Not so much for you.

551
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,347
All the times you've killed me,
and now here,

552
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,855
all I have to do is kill you once.

553
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,777
<i>Enough, Eobard.</i>

554
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,522
Enough.

555
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,907
Hey, you might wanna listen to her.

556
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,612
We know that if you wanted to kill us

557
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,911
you wouldn't have put
these dog collars on us first.

558
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,826
Now I know what it feels
like to hate myself.

559
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,620
<i>Well done.</i>

560
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:35,952
It wasn't a problem.

561
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,216
The pain... The pain.

562
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,635
I don't know how much longer
I can bear it.

563
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,968
It's all right. It's all right.

564
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,095
<i>You're gonna be all right
because we found her.</i>

565
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,347
We found her.

566
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,178
And now we have her.

567
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,479
I love you.

568
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,820
Now, very soon,
this nightmare will be over,

569
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:04,946
and I'll take you home.

570
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,276
So stand.

571
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,825
S.T.A.R. Labs is secure.

572
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,537
- If you hurt my friends...
- I did hurt your friends.

573
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,590
I really enjoyed hurting
your friends.

574
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,380
Are they alive?

575
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,170
Yes. Yes, for now.

576
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,640
We need your Kara's cooperation.

577
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,843
<i>Well, we don't need it.
It would be preferable.</i>

578
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,521
But for the time being,
you're more valuable as leverage.

579
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,808
- What do you want my sister for?
- To save my life.

580
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,108
That's your little mission statement,
isn't it?

581
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,532
Help people, save lives.

582
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,577
Well, now's your chance.

583
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,330
The General is dying.

584
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,289
Her blood. She's been exposed
to too much solar radiation.

585
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:03,373
Yes. Like Icarus,
I flew too close to the sun.

586
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,875
But we can save her.

587
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,960
We're going to save her.

588
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,296
All we need is a new heart.
And luckily,

589
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,175
on this planet we found
the perfect donor.

590
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,013
You stay the hell away
from my sister.

591
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,097
Hmm.

592
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,058
Such loyalty.

593
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,855
My sister tried to kill me.

594
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,771
That's why you stole the Prism?

595
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,648
So you can duplicate a red sun,

596
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,073
weaken Kara and cut into her?

597
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,401
You can't make an omelette
with invulnerable eggs.

598
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,027
Hey...

599
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,031
I'm going to kill you.

600
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,163
No, you won't.

601
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,415
You're weak.

602
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,165
And all of you choose the high road.

603
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,709
You're heroes.

604
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,354
I thought we were gonna die.

605
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,697
If I had a dime for every time
I thought that...

606
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,483
I'd have two dollars and forty cents.

607
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,863
I really thought I'd have
more than that.

608
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,491
It was Oliver. But it wasn't Oliver.

609
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,789
- Is Oliver in the High Castle?
- I just mean...

610
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,326
There's so much out there
for us to be afraid of.

611
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,415
Multiple Earths. Aliens.

612
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,791
Doppelgangers from the Third Reich.
I mean, what else is coming?

613
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,252
And that thought
wakes me up at night.

614
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,754
How do you ever
get back to sleep?

615
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,673
- Barry's by my side.
- Shut up.

616
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,426
- I'm sorry, I know you and Oliver...
- No.

617
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,015
Shut up.

618
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,104
We're not alone.

619
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,285
Stalag S.T.A.R. Labs.

620
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:06,954
What are we gonna do?

621
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,840
Kara... Where's Kara?

622
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,801
They're going to kill her.

623
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,260
It's okay. We're gonna get her back.

624
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,266
We need to figure out
where we are first.

625
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,351
Yeah. About that...

626
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,102
This is somewhat disconcerting.

627
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,901
I don't think this is our Earth.

628
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,241
We're on Earth-X.
