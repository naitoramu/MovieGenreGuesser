1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,083
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,251
The Quadrant.

3
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,421
You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover,

4
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,544
I never could get anyone to confirm
their existence.

5
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,795
Yeah, well, they are real.

6
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,922
<i>High-end cartel,
ruled by moneyed families</i>

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,674
<i>with ties to all things black market.</i>

8
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,256
<i>We think Diaz may be
helping her with that operation.</i>

9
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,554
You said you were an honorable man.

10
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,388
Now, I think you know Diaz isn't.
Help me stop him.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,646
I'm moving on to Plan B.
Killing Oliver Queen,

12
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,148
<i>and everyone he cares about.</i>

13
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,319
Uh, Dad, there's a shell in this one.

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,992
Uh, yes, there is.

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,615
Oh, isn't the pan hot?

16
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,038
Ow, it's immensely hot,

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,284
but when we are doing breakfast
for dinner at <i>Chez</i> Queen,

18
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,414
we do it right.

19
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,417
- Salt me, please, Felicity.
- What?

20
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,541
Can you pass the salt, please,
quickly, when you get the chance.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,179
I cannot put salt on this

22
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,508
if it's gonna put that expression
on your face.

23
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,553
- It's not about the salt, Oliver.
- Okay.

24
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,307
Call me when dinner's ready.

25
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,270
Okay, well, you have officially
scared him away, so...

26
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,651
Do you wanna
tell me what's going on with you?

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,609
Oliver, it's just... You're in here
pretending like you weren't almost

28
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,410
put in prison for the rest of your life.

29
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,079
Okay, we almost lost you
and the man who tried put you there

30
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,406
is still out there controlling the city,

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,457
and you're just in here
scrambling eggs, Oliver.

32
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,248
Yep.

33
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,416
Okay, first, I'm gonna stop him.

34
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,797
Second,

35
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,420
I am in here scrambling eggs

36
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,881
because I just wanted a night, one night

37
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,763
to remind myself what I'm fighting for.

38
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,769
Okay, yeah,
I guess I can departmentalize that.

39
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,142
I can help you with that.

40
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,522
Arm's strength back.

41
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,270
Motor function's restored.

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,448
All signs of the nerve damage you had
are gone.

43
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,073
Do you mind telling me how you did this?

44
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,824
Sorry, Doc, NDA.

45
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,074
So, if he's in the clear,
does that mean no more check ups?

46
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,288
Well, you guys are good to go.

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,036
- Enjoy date night.
- Thank you.

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,246
Thank you, Doctor.

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,001
I'll take care of the paper work.

50
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,048
I think we still have time
to make the shabu-shabu place.

51
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,216
Good.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,848
And over here
is the polymerase inhibitor.

53
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,266
Felicity and I had to take out, like,
three big loans

54
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,639
just to buy it, but it's...

55
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,517
You know, when you asked me
to meet you at your work...

56
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,933
You thought that I had a fantasy
about fooling around in an office?

57
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,191
I thought it was your way of milking
another hour out of work.

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,820
Well, I just thought that
you'd like to see how I spend my days.

59
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,572
I mean, this is some pretty
cutting edge tech.

60
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,154
Which is gonna make us late
for our reservation.

61
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,205
Okay, Mr. Punctuality.

62
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,203
Let me just shut down the rest
of the equipment.

63
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,503
No, off the post.

64
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,260
Oh, damn.

65
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,681
Okay, you know what,
when everything settles down,

66
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,134
I'm getting us the best seats
in the house.

67
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,185
You do know it's like $400 a ticket.

68
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,807
And they will have obstructed views.

69
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,731
Nah! Anything for my baby, okay?

70
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,104
Dad, quiet.

71
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,565
At least wait for a whistle
if you wanna talk.

72
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,400
Okay, okay.

73
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,618
I'll give you the courtesy of putting
that back in before we start this.

74
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,082
Does it have to be in that order?

75
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,873
- You work for Ricardo Diaz.
- Who?

76
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,875
You wanna play that game? Good.

77
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,673
I need to blow off some steam.

78
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,179
My mom and I used to eat
breakfast for dinner all the time,

79
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,262
except it wasn't ironic
'cause she worked nights, so...

80
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,813
I mean, not like that.
At least I hope not like that.

81
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,689
Are you gonna get it, Dad?

82
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,155
No, it's one of the perks of being
impeached, no interruptions.

83
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,527
Oliver, get the phone.

84
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,367
The phone.

85
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,614
Okay.

86
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,292
- Who is it?
- Anatoly.

87
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,122
Get down!

88
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,972
When I move, get William to the bedroom,

89
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,344
and shut the door, okay?

90
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,389
Are you two okay?

91
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,603
Yeah.

92
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:23,358
- Are they dead?
- No, but they're down.

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,052
- What?
- Trouble.

94
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,344
Down.

95
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,226
You know, you're gonna wake up
in a couple of hours,

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,777
your head's gonna be throbbing,

97
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,321
you're gonna regret not talking.

98
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,195
Oh.

99
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,110
You were just the bait.

100
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,366
Go. Go. Go.

101
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,833
Lyla, behind you.

102
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,297
- I had him.
- I know you did, honey.

103
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,559
No. Look at me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

104
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,817
- Don't look, peanut.
- Okay.

105
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,941
One bullet, back of the head,
you won't even feel it.

106
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,368
You know the cool thing
about sound waves?

107
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,158
They bounce.

108
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,635
Mr. Oliver.

109
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,638
Oh, thank God you are all right.

110
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,473
Thank you for coming so quickly.

111
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,395
I was close. Where are the men?

112
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,314
I tied 'em up, they're unconscious.

113
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,648
Hey, I just spoke to Rene, Dinah
and John, they're okay.

114
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,775
Good. And what about Curtis?

115
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,524
He's okay. His boyfriend isn't.
He has to go into surgery.

116
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,904
Starling General's not secure.

117
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,532
No, Lyla sent them to the A.R.G.U.S.
med bay, they're gonna be okay.

118
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,112
Quentin?

119
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,119
Quentin said that Diaz
isn't gonna attack the mayor.

120
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,871
That's too much in the public eye.

121
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,243
But Laurel's in the wind.

122
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,914
What about us?

123
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,543
That's why I called Raisa, okay?

124
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,967
We're gonna put you into A.R.G.U.S.
custody. They're gonna keep you safe.

125
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,589
You're not coming, are you?

126
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,175
No, I have to stay here.

127
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,801
I have to finish this.
You're gonna go

128
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,508
with Raisa and Felicity.

129
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,598
Actually, buddy, I'm not coming either.

130
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,023
I would like you
far away from here and safe.

131
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,476
Oliver, this is my fight
as much as it is yours.

132
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,689
I'm not going anywhere.

133
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,071
As the Green Arrow,

134
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,326
I have gone up
against some terrible people

135
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,578
who have tried to do terrible things.

136
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,162
Hey, look at me.

137
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,619
And I'm still here.

138
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,045
That doesn't mean you always will be.

139
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,584
You're right.

140
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,796
William, I just started
being your dad, okay?

141
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,551
I love being your dad.

142
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,180
And nothing is gonna take me away
from you,

143
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,432
especially not Ricardo Diaz.

144
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,477
Kick his ass.

145
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,031
John and Lyla are on their way?

146
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,025
Yeah, but why you having them come here?

147
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,244
Because our bunker is not secure.

148
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,864
Yeah, but why would Diaz
do all of this now?

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,662
He could have moved on us months ago.

150
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,243
Diaz wanted me in prison

151
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,044
to avoid making a martyr
of the Green Arrow.

152
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,918
With me out of the picture,
he would have come after you.

153
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,844
- Didn't go that way.
- Well, I'm not liking his Plan B.

154
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,091
This is the feed
from our surveillance cameras.

155
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,760
Son of a bitch.

156
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,312
What are we doing just watching?
Let's go there now.

157
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,639
There's no time, Rene.

158
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,975
Diaz has numbers.

159
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,560
Which means he has technical advantage.

160
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,689
John's right.

161
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,276
Bunkers and equipment can be replaced.

162
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,573
We need to look at the big picture.

163
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,446
Our families are on the way
to the safe house.

164
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,570
Better. NORAD bunker in Colorado.

165
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,116
Oh, no, no, no. Not the...

166
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,543
I should have done this months ago.

167
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,664
Torch it.

168
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,935
We leave now, we could snag a couple.
Send a message.

169
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,479
Don't worry you'll get your chance.
Just have patience, Rene.

170
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,733
Dinah's right.

171
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,608
Diaz is making his move.

172
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,205
We will make ours carefully
and precisely.

173
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,709
End this tonight.

174
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,470
How much support can we expect
from A.R.G.U.S.?

175
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,141
I had to stretch the rules to get
what little resources John has now.

176
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,723
As big a problem as Diaz is
for Star City...

177
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,600
A.R.G.U.S. is small potatoes.

178
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,521
What John means is A.R.G.U.S. isn't
chartered for law enforcement.

179
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,647
It looks like it's just up to us then.

180
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,069
Curtis.

181
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,231
Hey.

182
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,533
- How's Nick?
- He's resting.

183
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,236
Post-op.

184
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,948
It was pretty bad,
but he's gonna be okay.

185
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,043
- We got lucky.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

186
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,669
He took those bullets for me.

187
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,835
Don't worry, we'll give him payback
times 10.

188
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,961
Where do we start?

189
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,668
Well, we've gotta get a direct intel
on Diaz's location.

190
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,843
I'm working on that.

191
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,466
All right, and we need some
major league ordinance.

192
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,843
That, A.R.G.U.S. can help with.

193
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,304
Bennett and I,
we are a force multiplier.

194
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,352
You know, if we keep going this way,
we're gonna die out there.

195
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,266
It doesn't matter how much
weaponry Lyla provides,

196
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,901
how angry we are,
how much adrenaline we have,

197
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,730
if we just...
If we just press ahead like this,

198
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,194
we're all gonna die out there.

199
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,984
We haven't worked together in months.

200
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,993
You know, Diaz is not expecting
that, at least.

201
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,745
He's planned for everything.

202
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,956
Us getting back together,
working as a team.

203
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,079
It's a start,

204
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,668
but this guy has got an army.

205
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,587
He has city officials,
he's got the police,

206
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,663
he's got everything.

207
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,839
Please tell me there's a "but" coming
at the end of this pep talk.

208
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,211
Anatoly can get us in.

209
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,841
I thought he hated your guts.

210
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,673
I think we've come to an understanding.

211
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,343
I also think that he might be
the one move

212
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,099
Diaz does not see coming.

213
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,681
But, Oliver, if that's our tactical
advantage, we need to press it.

214
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,896
Let me set a meet with him. Okay?

215
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,194
Let us make a move off of his intel,

216
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,612
but until we have it,

217
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,321
I want you guys to stand down
and I...

218
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,035
I'm asking you to trust me.

219
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,453
I know that that trust
does not come easy

220
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,124
after everything's that's happened.

221
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,083
Let's put all of that aside

222
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,336
and get this done.

223
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,683
Thank you very much.

224
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,552
My family is alive thanks to you.

225
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,354
Please save gratitude for
when I'm sipping on

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,022
umbrella straw on beach,

227
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,691
safe and sound in Maldives.

228
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,607
I don't know how long your family's
safety is going to last.

229
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,785
SCPD has instructions, kill on sight.

230
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,121
Diaz's base of operations is too secure.

231
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,450
We can't move on it
without losing people.

232
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,043
Agreed.

233
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,420
Best bet to get him on move.

234
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,797
In transit, so to speak.

235
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,087
Well, but he's gonna expect us
to hit back.

236
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,464
I'd expect him to stay
where he's secure.

237
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,423
Perhaps I can think of something
to motivate him.

238
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,182
I'm asking a lot of you.

239
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,682
I appreciate it.

240
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,563
You cannot wage revolution

241
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,603
in white gloves.

242
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,021
Lenin had many faults,

243
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,528
but he was right about that.

244
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,205
You wanna stop pacing?
Giving me a headache.

245
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,537
Funny, I was going to say
the same to you.

246
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,584
Your pitch to the Quadrant
was that you controlled this city.

247
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,789
And I do.

248
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,458
Then why have you turned it
into a war zone tonight?

249
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,462
I thought we couldn't let the vigilantes
be turned into martyrs.

250
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,299
The judge kicked the case
and let Oliver Queen walk.

251
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,476
So you switched gears
from careful and precise

252
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,061
to loud and messy?

253
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,150
Your attitude is what I find...

254
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,688
...to be unwanted.

255
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,023
Be careful, Ricardo.

256
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,608
You've already given us the city.

257
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,451
Are you suggesting that

258
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,162
I'm replaceable?

259
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,915
I'm suggesting no such thing.

260
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,004
Miss Cassamento does not appear
to be pleased.

261
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,927
- What happened tonight?
- You underestimate your enemy.

262
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,633
They're strong and motivated.

263
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,219
They got lucky.

264
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,850
Luck, strength, what does it matter?

265
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,017
You did not kill bees.
You merely poked the hive.

266
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,227
Bees will be agitated.

267
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,359
You think they're gonna come here?
That's fine.

268
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,565
Let them bring it on.

269
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,900
Bring them here?

270
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,447
This place, lovely,

271
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,449
but not secure.

272
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,534
At least not enough

273
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,790
for what you know
they're going to come after you with.

274
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,295
Anatoly did it.

275
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,305
Diaz will be on his way
to the SCPD in an hour.

276
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,634
A.R.G.U.S. doesn't have the authority
to arrest Diaz,

277
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,724
so once you have him in custody,
what's the next step?

278
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,851
Yeah, Lyla's right. We can't just
hand him over to the police.

279
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,894
And, no offense, but your Lian Yu
super max is kind of blown up.

280
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,191
One problem at a time.

281
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,775
All right, we need to end this

282
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,732
and that means
solving our first problem.

283
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,200
Getting Diaz.

284
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,284
Can I say it for old times sake?

285
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,115
Suit up.

286
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,671
In Russia, we travel in nicer cars.

287
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,433
This girl ain't pretty,
but she's bullet proof.

288
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,356
What's that?

289
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,903
Construction?

290
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,866
Hold up, guys.
We gotta move this forklift.

291
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,959
Get this under control now.

292
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,874
You forget your gun?

293
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,894
Curtis, don't!

294
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,823
You hurt someone I care about!

295
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,654
You want some more?

296
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,531
You...

297
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,944
Quadrant reinforcements with SCPD
and more are on the way.

298
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,111
We gotta pull out now.

299
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,918
We almost got that son of a bitch.

300
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,628
How's Curtis?

301
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,797
He's resting with Nick.

302
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,301
One inch either way,
he would have bled out. He got lucky.

303
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,431
- It wasn't just luck.
- What do you mean?

304
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,262
Diaz could have killed Curtis,

305
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,436
but he went for some sort of
necklace instead.

306
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,688
Must be one damn important
piece of jewelry.

307
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,064
More like a piece of tech. Look.

308
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,782
It's a GRV-657. Solid state drive,
military grade, dynamic encryption.

309
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,027
Whatever is on it,
Diaz has gone through some major trouble

310
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,577
to keep it secure and close though.

311
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,404
This looks like something we should
have our hands on.

312
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,911
Wait, how do we know?
There could be nothing on it.

313
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,867
You just said so yourself.
I mean, Diaz went after this

314
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,042
instead of going after Curtis.

315
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,792
Your digital sniffer,
can it read the drive?

316
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,498
Yeah. If you get me close enough,
for sure.

317
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,003
But Diaz is headed to SCPD.

318
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,504
I'm sure he's gonna let us
stroll right in.

319
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,756
They'll let me.

320
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,760
What do you mean? Diaz knows that
A.R.G.U.S. is working against him.

321
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,225
The police still have to
keep up appearances.

322
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,639
Wouldn't look good if the decline

323
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,891
a visit from the head of
a federal agency.

324
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,608
And if things go south,
I've got you to back me up.

325
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:17,149
I think that this is a big gamble
for an unknown pay off.

326
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,696
It probably is, Oliver,

327
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,533
but it might be our only shot.

328
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,868
So, we're all on board here?

329
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,742
Yeah.

330
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,290
Double perimeter security.

331
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,289
Next time I see Oliver Queen,

332
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,378
I want his head on a spike.

333
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,792
You got it, boss.

334
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,874
Where's the tech kid?

335
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,208
Cosby's over there.

336
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,305
Oh, Mr. Diaz.

337
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,013
I need to know if what's on this
is still intact

338
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,099
without you looking at the data.

339
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,598
- Can you do that?
- Uh...

340
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,105
Your grandma's life depends on it.

341
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,771
Yes, sir.

342
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,036
Close the door.

343
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,041
They knew!

344
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,089
Who? Knew what?

345
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,669
That I was moving!

346
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,466
That my men were coming
for them tonight!

347
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,980
Laurel, she's buttoned up, right?

348
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,142
Who could've told them?

349
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,818
I do not know.

350
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,190
Hmm?

351
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,775
You and Queen,

352
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,240
you go way back.

353
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,574
Yes.

354
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,995
Which is why his betrayal hurts so much.

355
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,372
If it wasn't you,

356
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,175
then who?

357
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,634
Hmm?

358
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,510
Who brought men and police
to help us tonight?

359
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,688
- Cassamento.
- How did she know we'd be attacked?

360
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,724
I did not ask for backup.

361
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,392
Did you?

362
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,154
Why would she tip off Queen

363
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,859
and then drag our asses

364
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,237
out of the fire?

365
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,285
That doesn't make sense.

366
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,584
Yes, it does if she wants leverage
over you.

367
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,544
To make you grovel.

368
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,672
Truth be telling,
I do many times before in Bratva.

369
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,344
I don't grovel.

370
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,266
How's it going with the sniffer?

371
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,719
Oh, just snifferific.

372
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,554
I am programming it to specifically

373
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,685
couple with the digital signature
of Diaz's drive.

374
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,524
I'll have to do some
on the fly programming

375
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,068
just to cut out the noise,
but totally in my wheelhouse.

376
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,564
Does this absolutely
have to be done on site?

377
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,117
It absolutely does if you would
absolutely like it to work. Why?

378
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,657
Oliver, you do know I have been
on the field before, right?

379
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,742
Russia. Twice.

380
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,412
Nanda Parbat, Merlyn Global.

381
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,418
That all happened
before you were a parent.

382
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,424
Well, if it will
make you feel any better,

383
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,752
I will not be the one
infiltrating the precinct.

384
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,462
That'll be Lyla.

385
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,263
The same Lyla who's also a parent.

386
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,756
And whose husband didn't blink twice

387
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,218
when she volunteered
to go into Diaz's dragon den.

388
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:35,848
Lyla's a soldier.

389
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,804
Yeah, which is why
she's the one infiltrating

390
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,355
and I'm the one hacking remotely.

391
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,605
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

392
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,989
- Do we have a problem here?
- No.

393
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:49,983
Ready when you are.

394
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,580
All I have to do is position this
some place central?

395
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,132
Yes, if Diaz's drive is in that
building, the sniffer will find it.

396
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,800
I can monitor the transfer from here,

397
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,344
but I need this back for the full pull.

398
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,966
How much time do you need
for the transfer?

399
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,013
- A couple of minutes, max.
- Copy that.

400
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,678
- Everybody in position?
- In position.

401
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,728
First hint, if anything's wrong,
signal us.

402
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,310
Copy. We move in five.

403
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:25,940
Everything okay?

404
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,773
Yeah, it's just that it's so nice to
see how you and John, you know, work.

405
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,779
When you're on the field,
you guys are so in sync.

406
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:32,985
How do you do it?

407
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,491
You're asking for marital advice now?

408
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,992
Sorry. Yeah, totally terrible timing.

409
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,699
It's just that Oliver doesn't even
want me here,

410
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,410
so I just thought maybe a tip
or two would work.

411
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,747
We always knew our lives
would be high risk.

412
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,500
Eventually, we got to a point where

413
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,756
worrying about that seemed
less important

414
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,712
than enjoying the time we have together.

415
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,839
Even if that was on a battlefield.

416
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,012
Also, getting divorced helps.

417
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,162
Can I help you with something?

418
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,784
Lyla Michaels.

419
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,328
Where can I find your captain?

420
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,286
We're kind of between captains

421
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,832
since our ex-mayor fired the last one.

422
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,376
What's A.R.G.U.S. doing here?

423
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,587
Investigating Ricardo Diaz.

424
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,879
Never heard of him.

425
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,178
Be that as it may, I'm gonna need
to see you CompStat reports

426
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,379
for the last six months.

427
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,589
Hmm.

428
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,765
You do not wanna make me
come back with a warrant.

429
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,596
Wait here.

430
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,694
- You're on, Felicity.
- All right, locked on.

431
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,491
Give it a few minutes.

432
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,028
Data all seems intact, Mr. Diaz.

433
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,619
We got a problem?

434
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,826
I'm not sure.

435
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,161
You better get sure.

436
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,664
Yes, sir.

437
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,047
Guys, the encryption rate,
it's Corto Maltesean in origin.

438
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,253
What does that mean?

439
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,134
I mean, I don't know,
but if I was betting, financial records.

440
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,346
What if these are all Diaz's books?
Everyone he has on his payroll?

441
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,177
We could liberate the city.

442
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,971
Take down his whole operation.

443
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,520
The data is being copied.
Cloned actually.

444
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,355
- What?
- It's happening on site somehow.

445
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,233
Some bitch from A.R.G.U.S. is here.

446
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,493
She wants to look
at our CompStat reports.

447
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,662
No, she doesn't.

448
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,414
Lyla, we're done. Grab the sniffer.

449
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,918
Agent Michaels, can I talk to you
for a minute?

450
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,082
They're on to us.

451
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,874
Forget the device.
Just get out of there.

452
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,015
Director Michaels,

453
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,222
I heard you're interested in me.

454
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,561
Honey,

455
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,605
you better get in here.

456
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,434
Oh, frack it.

457
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,090
Hey!

458
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,388
Sorry! I'm sorry!

459
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,369
That was an all-out fight with the SCPD.

460
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,992
Totally nuts, even by my standards.

461
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,119
Yes, but it was the only option though.

462
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,666
I mean,
this was too important not to get.

463
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,914
How would you even know?
This is supposed to be encrypted.

464
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,212
Well, you can just call me an optimist
because I'm thinking

465
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,789
in two to three hours,
all of us are gonna be extremely happy.

466
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,966
Can you gather information
as it decrypts?

467
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,338
It would be nice
to get a jump on things.

468
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,714
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

469
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,592
This is an all or nothing
type deal, okay?

470
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,642
We go in mid-decryption
and the whole drive wipes.

471
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,761
- Nothing.
- Felicity, may I speak with you?

472
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,266
Yes.

473
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,109
I'm just gonna take a wild guess

474
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,774
and say that this isn't
one of those conversations

475
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,780
that starts with like,
"I love you, you were brave,

476
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,986
"you go, that was awesome."

477
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,447
No, this is a conversation that
happens because I love you.

478
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,911
Okay.

479
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,495
You promised me you would stay put.

480
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,077
Well, I didn't exactly promise.

481
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,037
Fine, you promised me
that you wouldn't do anything stupid.

482
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,963
You charged into a firefight.

483
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,460
Which was a calculated risk.

484
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,251
Did you calculate how close
Ricardo Diaz came

485
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,086
to shooting you in the back of the head?

486
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,422
We got what we wanted.

487
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,801
It's not...

488
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,597
And if I'm right, what we wanted

489
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,724
has the list of everyone in the city
that Diaz controls.

490
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,775
This could help us get our home
back from Diaz, Oliver.

491
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,937
We could actually save our city
this time around.

492
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,281
I think that's a little bit more
important than what ifs.

493
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,108
This is why I started working
alone again.

494
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,364
Yeah.

495
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,695
You know what?
I tried convincing myself

496
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,700
that that was the right move too,
but it's not

497
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,997
because we're married.

498
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,915
And we're supposed to be
each other's strength.

499
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,373
So there is no alone for us anymore.

500
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,170
It's not that simple and you know it.

501
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,373
God, I'm really gonna start needing
you to see it that way.

502
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,469
Hey. What the hell are you doing here?

503
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,724
I heard Felicity might have got hold
of Diaz's payroll,

504
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,350
so I hitched a ride back with John.

505
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,689
I can help with the decryption.

506
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,813
Whoa, whoa, Curtis. Hey, are you crazy?

507
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,485
You are in no shape to be up and about.

508
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,609
A deranged madman attacked everyone
I hold dear and near to me.

509
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,444
I'll nap later.

510
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:09,112
He also made you almost bleed out,
so I need you to stop, okay?

511
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,451
Curtis.

512
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,700
How is me resting gonna help
anything, Dinah?

513
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,628
Okay. But being reckless isn't
gonna help anything either.

514
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,834
He almost killed my man.

515
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,040
What do you expect my reaction to be?

516
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,008
Exactly the same as mine.

517
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,177
I'm sorry, I...

518
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,506
I wasn't thinking about Vincent.
I'm so sorry, Dinah.

519
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,763
You shouldn't be thinking about Vincent.

520
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,684
You need to be thinking about Nick.

521
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,773
Just please don't go about this
the same way that I did, Curtis.

522
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,774
Blind with rage.

523
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,815
Remember how you had to talk me down?

524
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,443
I remember my advice not really taking.

525
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,650
Yeah.

526
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,947
But you're a lot smarter than me.

527
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,789
Look, Nick is lying
in a hospital bed right now.

528
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,833
If you don't take it easy,
you're gonna end up right back in one.

529
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,498
We got this. Go be with him.

530
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,334
That's absurd. Why would I tip off
the Green Arrow

531
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,669
only to save you from him?

532
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,170
You tell me.

533
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,174
You're delusional.
You ought to be thanking me.

534
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,929
I hacked, and I hacked,

535
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,520
and I back-traced where
Felicity Smoak took your clone data.

536
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,392
We can get there before she decrypts it.

537
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,734
Good work. Call everyone.

538
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,108
- We're going to war.
- War?

539
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,027
You've already shot up two apartments
and a hospital.

540
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,609
To say nothing about what happened
in your own police station.

541
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:30,864
Your point?

542
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,372
You're out of control
and out of your depth, Ricardo.

543
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,541
We accepted you
into the Quadrant because...

544
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,249
So sorry, I couldn't hear you.

545
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,249
You have something stuck in your throat.

546
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,797
Clean this up.

547
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,302
Felicity says that the decryption
is only at about 40%.

548
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,558
I'm sure she's working
as fast as she can.

549
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,684
Well, I'm quite sure she is,

550
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,391
but maybe we need to come up
with a backup plan

551
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,351
just in case this doesn't pan out
the way we think.

552
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,936
I agree.

553
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,817
And I'm open to suggestions.

554
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,442
The first thing is

555
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,153
figuring out what is going on
in your head.

556
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,368
Yeah, what else you guys talk about?

557
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,245
I may have prodded her a bit,

558
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,327
but, Oliver, I really didn't need to.

559
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,162
Everyone can see the tension
between the two of you.

560
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,418
Well, John, I asked her
not to go into the field.

561
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,334
And she did.

562
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,045
And I'm sorry that she thinks
I'm changing the rules for her,

563
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,008
but I am changing the rules for her
because things have changed.

564
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,559
William.

565
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,054
Diaz's people attacked us in our home.

566
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,099
Sitting down for a meal in our home.

567
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,064
So don't ask me to sit here and pretend
like things aren't different.

568
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:51,733
And you told me
that I had spread myself too thin,

569
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,318
and I listened to what you said.

570
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,029
And I took it to heart
and I made some changes.

571
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,576
She went into the field tonight,
she split my focus

572
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,660
and it could have gotten
both of us killed.

573
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,835
- But it didn't.
- Well...

574
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,086
The truth is, you were there
for her tonight.

575
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,301
The same way she's been there
for you as Overwatch.

576
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,722
And look, when I said
that your focus was split,

577
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,973
I didn't mean throwing away
everything and everyone

578
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,519
that gives you strength.

579
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,780
Diaz is here with an army.

580
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,503
Oliver Queen doesn't make it out alive!

581
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,512
Tricyclic gas is filling the building.

582
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,965
This is Diaz.

583
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,594
His men breached
the northeast entrance.

584
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,347
Between that and the gas,
we don't have a lot of time.

585
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,473
Are there any other ways out of here?

586
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,680
South corridor, there's a secret
stairwell that leads to street level.

587
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,312
If anything goes sideways, Curtis rigged
the whole place to go boom.

588
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,109
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
All right, we gotta go.

589
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,654
- Not yet.
- Felicity, we have to go now.

590
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,072
The decryption is not done.

591
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,070
I'm not leaving until it's done.
Do not fight me on this.

592
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,111
Everyone else has to go.
We will catch up.

593
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,030
Just in case.

594
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,173
I'll cover you. Go!

595
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,529
Get out of here!
Go, get out of here!

596
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,662
Come on! Come on!

597
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,518
I had him, honey. Let's go.

598
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,895
- How much time do we have?
- Five minutes.

599
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,231
We don't have five minutes, Felicity.

600
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,441
- You have to get out of here.
- No chance.

601
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,618
Once the decryption is done,
I'm gonna e-mail it to you

602
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,911
and basically to the entire world.

603
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,865
Hey, hey. You okay?

604
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,912
This is our last chance, Oliver.

605
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,370
This could be our only chance
to stop him.

606
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,334
Let me try. William needs you.

607
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,210
William needs us.

608
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,677
I'm gonna find another way.

609
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,639
Come on.

610
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,974
- How may flights are there?
- A lot.

611
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,771
Where's Oliver and Felicity?

612
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,363
Okay, we're almost there, Felicity.

613
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,657
You can do this. Hey!

614
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,166
I was just coming to kill you.

615
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,717
Looks like you met me halfway.

616
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,806
What hurts more, do you think?

617
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,937
Me killing her in front of you,

618
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,814
or you in front of her?

619
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:05,074
You'll do anything to keep her safe,
won't you?

620
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,579
Love, that's the real king killer.

621
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,333
Click it.

622
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,938
Oliver! Come on,
let's get them out of here!

623
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,996
I'm so sorry about your men, Lyla.

624
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,506
Bennett was a good soldier.

625
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,668
They all were.

626
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,886
We should go back.

627
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,671
I wanna see Diaz's body.

628
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,924
I sent in a forensics team.

629
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,221
He wasn't there.

630
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,306
Son of a bitch has nine lives.

631
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,516
I'm sorry.

632
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,360
Did Felicity finish the decryption?

633
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,237
No.

634
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,279
No, she had to leave it.

635
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,868
Where does that put us?

636
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,988
Absolutely nowhere.

637
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,122
I know, buddy. We miss you too.

638
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,585
Well, it's gonna be a few more days,

639
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,666
but we're safe, okay?

640
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,884
We're both safe.

641
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,595
Hey, we love you, William.

642
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,720
Bye, kiddo.

643
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,437
- Is he okay? How's he doing?
- He's okay.

644
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,231
He's scared, but, you know, he's safe

645
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,519
and just wants all of this to be over.

646
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,899
Yeah, yeah.

647
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,068
Don't we all.

648
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,948
Hey, I'm, uh...

649
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,615
I shouldn't have pushed you away.

650
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:17,751
I should have trusted you
to keep yourself safe,

651
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:22,798
and I should have trusted my abilities
to help keep you safe.

652
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,501
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

653
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,469
It's good to know after all these years
that you can still learn something.

654
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,678
You know, I still have ways to go.

655
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,052
That's true.

656
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,313
So what now?

657
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,977
I have an idea.

658
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,275
Thank you for coming.

659
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:55,286
I asked you here because we lost
another Quadrant member last night.

660
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,956
You see, I don't mind partners

661
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,001
when they're loyal.

662
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,548
It turns out Miss Cassamento wasn't.

663
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,756
So what I have to decide right now

664
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:17,812
is whether you two
fall into that same category.

665
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,647
You wanted in the Quadrant, you're in.

666
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,313
This doesn't have to be adversarial.

667
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,144
See, that's the thing.

668
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,654
Me wanting in,

669
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,699
I always thought

670
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,868
that I wanted that.

671
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,949
And I realized,

672
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,699
it's just not enough.

673
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,080
You don't want a partnership.

674
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,372
You want a controlling stake.

675
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,967
Guilty.

676
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,307
Let's try this again.

677
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,301
May I?

678
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,559
We have the Quadrant's resources.

679
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,565
We got its muscle,

680
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,102
its connections.

681
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,650
All I need

682
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,369
is loyalty.

683
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,575
The Quadrant's running out of members.

684
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,661
Do I have it?

685
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,269
So far,
Ricardo Diaz has been unstoppable.

686
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,680
He has aligned himself

687
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,893
with the most powerful
criminal organization in the country.

688
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,196
He controls Star City's government,
its infrastructure

689
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,988
and its police force.

690
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,490
I can't stop him on my own.

691
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,707
And when you say you can't stop him,

692
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,035
are you speaking as the former mayor

693
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,420
or as someone else?

694
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,046
You want my help,

695
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,093
I'm gonna need two things from you.

696
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,263
The first is,

697
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,011
I'm gonna need you to say the words.

698
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,012
I am the Green Arrow.

699
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,315
And the truth shall set you free.

700
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,187
What's the second thing?
