Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:03,887
These people,
they're volunteers?

3
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:05,054
True believers.

4
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:06,255
Thank you
for your service,

5
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,657
your mind,
and your belief in me.

6
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,263
What happened?

7
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:14,098
The prisoners were out
of their cells.

8
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:20,515
Miss Lance, I want you to give
your father a message.

9
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:21,550
Err!

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,620
Help! Help
in here, please!

11
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:29,624
And, Ollie, I know that
I am not the love of your life...

12
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,426
But you will always be
the love of mine.

13
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:32,894
Out of the way!

14
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,531
- What happened?
- I don't know. She was fine.

15
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:41,203
Time of death 11:59.

16
00:00:57,654 --> 00:01:01,890
A life that hasn't
had a chance to fully grow

17
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,658
and live out its purpose
in this world

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,662
is a life that has been taken
from this earth too soon.

19
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:11,867
Oliver Queen, whom I'm told
is practically family,

20
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:14,102
will be delivering the eulogy.

21
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:16,771
Mr. Queen.

22
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:18,773
Mr. Queen, are you ready?

23
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:24,646
Um, I could probably
say a few words.

24
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:41,162
Tommy Merlyn was--was one
of the greatest people

25
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,231
that I've ever known.

26
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:47,903
He was--he was
so much more than just...

27
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,971
A billionaire playboy.

28
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:54,376
I loved him.

29
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:00,448
I loved him in--
in every way

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,717
you could possibly love someone.

31
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,596
And so did Oliver...

32
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,935
And I'm sure if Oliver
could be here today

33
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:21,636
he would say so...

34
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,006
But clearly,
it's too painful.

35
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,114
I don't understand.

36
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,019
I'm sorry. I...

37
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,567
Ok.

38
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:02,644
Excuse me.
Are you a relati--

39
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:05,647
Oliver, softly:
Doctor, he's her father.

40
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:12,554
I'm, um,
terribly sorry for your loss.

41
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,822
These are
her belongings.

42
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:16,291
I'll--I'll take care
of those.

43
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:23,798
Laurel.

44
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,168
Baby.

45
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,974
We should get you
out of here.

46
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:39,514
I love you, too.

47
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,383
Give that baby girl
a kiss for me.

48
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,724
Didn't expect to see
you standing there.

49
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,726
Where else
would I go?

50
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,401
How's Lyla?

51
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:04,005
She and baby Sara are
at a Argus safe house.

52
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:07,308
I have an army buddy
looking after Carly and Andy Jr.

53
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,543
You worried
about your brother?

54
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:09,944
I don't think he would
do anything

55
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:13,581
to hurt my family,
but...I don't know.

56
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,216
Clearly, I never
knew him.

57
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,219
All right, John.
As the...

58
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:23,124
World's leading expert
in blaming yourself,

59
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:24,592
please don't do it.

60
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:27,462
You warned me,
Oliver.

61
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,230
Straight up,
you warned me.

62
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:33,268
If I'd listened to you
instead of trusting my brother,

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,803
Laurel would be
alive right now.

64
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:37,205
You can't know that.

65
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:38,440
On behalf of Mayor Adams

66
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:40,275
and everyone at city hall,

67
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:42,377
I'm very sorry
to announce the death

68
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,547
of assistant district attorney
Laurel Lance.

69
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:48,650
Miss Lance was conducting
a deposition

70
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,552
of Damien Darhk prior
to tonight's incident

71
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:52,387
in Iron Heights
correctional facility.

72
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,956
I'm informed
by the Department of Corrections

73
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,558
that Mr. Darhk remains
at large

74
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,627
and is the leading suspect
in Miss Lance's death.

75
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,996
I'm gonna get
some air.

76
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:03,298
John.

84
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:43,237
Hi. I didn't know--

85
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,474
you called
for the team.

86
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,075
What's going on, Oliver?

87
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:49,810
Well...

88
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:52,780
Darhk is out there,
and he has his magic back.

89
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:55,016
As much as I'm sure
all of us want to

90
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:57,018
climb up inside
of our own grief--

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,286
We have to get
that son of a bitch.

92
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,755
Definitely,
but we haven't

93
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:02,290
even put her
in the ground yet.

94
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:06,227
Uh, Captain?

Page 3.
This was last night

96
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:10,364
a-a-after Iron Heights.

97
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,066
This article says that
she used a Sonic weapon

98
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:15,136
against the dealer
and--and the buyer.

99
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,541
Guys, CCTV footage
from last night's attack.

100
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,065
S-Sara came back.

101
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,845
All the crazy things
that we've seen.

102
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:27,915
Maybe my baby--
my baby girl, maybe she's not gone.

103
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:32,286
I--I mean, we--
we saw her...

104
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,155
Yeah,
but, you know,

105
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,423
I mean, ev-everyone
thought Oliver was dead

106
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:36,624
when the Gambit
went down.

107
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:37,958
Everyone thought
ray Palmer was dead,

108
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,060
your brother.

109
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:40,428
Captain, I know.
I know,

110
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,663
but this is different.

111
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:44,265
John's right.

112
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,833
This bag
from the hospital

113
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,601
was supposed to contain
all of Laurel's belongings.

114
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:48,969
Supposed to?

115
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,805
Sonic device is missing.

116
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:51,939
That explains it.
There were people

117
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,641
in and out
of Laurel's room--

118
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:55,843
doctors, nurses,
orderlies.

119
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:58,546
Wait. You think
someone took it?

120
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,648
Yeah.

121
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,516
Laurel.

122
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:04,485
Uh, Captain, let's not
go there just yet.

123
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:05,853
Now you don't think
that with everything

124
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:07,621
that we have seen,
that we have all seen,

125
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:10,091
that there is a ch-chance that
Laurel is back?

126
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:13,260
Cisco keyed the Sonic device
to Laurel's vocal cords.

127
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:14,862
No one else is supposed
to be able to use that.

128
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,630
Right, right.

129
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:18,132
What do you think?

130
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,225
Quentin.

131
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:50,664
Yeah.

132
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:02,610
Dr. Schwartz--ahem.

133
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:06,914
I'd like to thank you
for your discretion

134
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,682
throughout all
of this.

135
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:11,519
Doctor-patient
privilege,

136
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:15,489
and in any case,
she, uh, helped this city.

137
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:17,958
I mean, the least
I can do is help her

138
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,593
and you.

139
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,234
At least 12 staffers
saw me bring her

140
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:29,670
into the hospital
last night.

141
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,606
And they saw
the Black Canary,

142
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:35,776
but we operated
on Laurel Lance,

143
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,678
who I believe was
injured

144
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,183
during an Iron Heights
prison riot.

145
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:45,085
There was a Black Canary
sighting last night.

146
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:47,354
This person was wearing
a Sonic device,

147
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:50,024
the same Sonic device
that was taken

148
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,660
from Laurel's belongings
in her room.

149
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:53,961
Are you saying--

150
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,197
I have reason to believe
that someone

151
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:59,433
walked into her room
and took it.

152
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:01,735
Now can you put me
on a path?

153
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,440
There's
a frequent flyer.

154
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,743
Frequent flyer?
What does that mean?

155
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:13,380
A patient who pays
repeated visits to the E.R.

156
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:16,584
Now I've treated
her a few times,

157
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:17,785
and there's
something--

158
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:18,819
there's something
off about her?

159
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,454
Mm-hmm.

160
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:23,624
Would you give me
her name?

161
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,226
Doctor-patient
privilege applies

162
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:29,330
to all my patients,
Mr. Queen.

163
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:30,664
Yeah.

164
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,340
Oliver?

165
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:44,645
I'm sorry. I...

166
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:47,481
I didn't know
where else to go and, uh...

167
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,951
Do you want to
come inside?

168
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:54,154
I don't think that
it's the best idea.

169
00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:00,160
I'm sorry they didn't
let your mom attend the funeral.

170
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:05,266
It was a nice service.

171
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:09,103
Tommy would have
liked it.

172
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:10,671
He would have liked it more
if you would have

173
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:12,273
said a few words.

174
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:16,977
I stayed up
all night.

175
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:18,245
I was working
on a eulogy,

176
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:20,614
and...

177
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:25,219
I just filled
page after page with...

178
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:27,655
Stories of us,

179
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,023
but then I realized
that I just didn't

180
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:33,661
have the right to say any
of those things.

181
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:35,396
What are you
talking about?

182
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,169
Oliver, Tommy loved you.

183
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:46,840
Laurel,
I failed him.

184
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:52,313
I came back from that island
with another chance.

185
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,681
It was a chance
to help people.

186
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:57,117
It was...

187
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:59,720
It was a chance
to make this city better...

188
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:06,760
And I couldn't,

189
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:09,096
and now
Tommy's dead.

190
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:10,798
Ahem.

191
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,734
Oliver...

192
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,936
You can't blame
yourself.

193
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:21,942
You'd blame me, too,
if you knew the truth.

194
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:23,744
What truth?

195
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:28,916
That was Oliver.

196
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:32,019
Laurel's still,
you know, there.

197
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,954
So he thinks he has
a lead on some woman

198
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:36,757
who recently visits
the emergency room a lot.

199
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,125
I'm gonna try
and cross-reference

200
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,060
facial recog
with last night's attack

201
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:44,264
with the hospital
security footage.

202
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:45,666
Hey.

203
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,103
At the hospital,
you said that

204
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:51,605
you'd never forgive
yourself for what happened.

205
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:52,906
Andy's working
with Darhk,

206
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:55,075
has been
the entire time.

207
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:58,112
He helped him
find the idol,

208
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:00,814
helped him
out of jail.

209
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,249
Oliver warned me,
but I pretty much

210
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,084
told him
to go to hell.

211
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:08,622
Laurel is dead
because of me.

212
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:12,493
I don't know what happened.
I wasn't there.

213
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,728
I don't know what to say.

214
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,930
There's nothing
to say.

215
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:26,874
Thank you for everything
at the hospital.

216
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:30,444
I don't think any of us were ready
to talk to the media.

217
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:32,112
One of the few
advantages of dating

218
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:35,649
a political operative,
I guess.

219
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,851
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to joke.

220
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:42,990
Please. I could--
I could use some jokes,

221
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:45,225
anything to keep
my mind off of...

222
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:52,266
Everything.

223
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:55,369
Speaking of actually,
you--

224
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:58,439
you never told me why
you became

225
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:01,175
a political operative
anyway.

226
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:06,714
Alex Davis.

227
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:14,555
You work for them!

228
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,558
What are you
talking about?

229
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,056
Ollie.

230
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,257
What's going on?

231
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,059
Alex just got
attacked by some girl

232
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:53,660
wearing Laurel's
Sonic device.

233
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:55,028
Do you know
where she went?

234
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,417
You're dressed like
a friend of mine.

235
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,619
Why?

236
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:23,791
Why did you
abandon us?

237
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,893
We needed your help,
and all you cared about

238
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:27,227
were your friends!

239
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:29,396
You didn't care
about any of us.

240
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:30,564
What are you
talking about?

241
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,101
You left us.

242
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:36,670
You left us
at Reddington!

243
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:39,606
You left us there to die.

244
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,909
You failed this city.

245
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:01,400
It wasn't Laurel,
but it was sure like seeing a ghost.

246
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,067
And hearing one.
That Sonic device

247
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,502
has been modified.

248
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,371
My ear plugs did
not do a thing.

249
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,573
The Sonic device is what shouldn't
have done a damn thing.

250
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,742
You said Cisco keyed it
specifically to Laurel?

251
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,177
It should have
only worked with Laurel.

252
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,979
The crazy
part is that this girl is using it

253
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,215
at much higher decibels than
Laurel ever did.

254
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,883
Ok. So who
is this girl?

255
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,351
When she attacked Alex,
she accused him

256
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,586
of working
for someone.

257
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,321
Ruvé Darhk?

258
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,790
HIVE. She said
the Green Arrow left them

259
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,291
at Reddington to die.

260
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,659
What's Reddington?

261
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,194
Reddington
industrial is where

262
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,829
Darhk held you all
hostage over the holidays.

263
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,531
You think this girl is
one of HIVE's prisoners.

264
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,299
They weren't prisoners, remember?
They were volunteers.

265
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,136
Right, but still, let's check
missing persons

266
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,737
for a family with at least one
teenage daughter

267
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,439
who went missing
over Christmas.

268
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,511
The Sharp family.

269
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:49,747
Mom and dad's bodies
were found two days after Christmas.

270
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,048
Cause of death hypoxia.

271
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,950
Could be HIVE's
gas chamber.

272
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,385
What about
the daughter?

273
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,359
Class president,
academic decathlete, gymnast,

274
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,628
basically a 16-year-old
badass in the making.

275
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,396
She never even missed
a day of school.

276
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,598
Until her parents
met Damien Darhk, I'm guessing.

277
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,102
She said we left
them there to die, and we did.

278
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,270
What do you mean?

279
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,738
All those people
at Reddington.

280
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,072
There of their own
choosing, Oliver.

281
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,474
And we know that HIVE
drugs people

282
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,909
to make them susceptible
to suggestion.

283
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:21,245
She told me that
we failed this city.

284
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,181
She's not wrong.

285
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,324
Thanks for coming.

286
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,293
I fear I lack the words
to convey the true depths

287
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,462
of my sympathy.

288
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,664
To lose a child once
is unimaginable,

289
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,733
but for it to be
both children...

290
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,569
Look. I know you and I
haven't always been

291
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,270
on the same side
of things,

292
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:50,007
but, uh, Laurel, you know,
she thought of you as a friend.

293
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,410
Just as I thought
of her.

294
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,644
She brought me
comfort during

295
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,380
a difficult
time period,

296
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,483
the word will be
a darker place without her.

297
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,151
Yeah. Well, not for long.

298
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,587
Ok. I got all her things.
What else do I need?

299
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,754
I'm afraid I don't
understand.

300
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,490
What else do I
have to bring for her

301
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,192
when she comes out of this,
you know, Lazarus Pit thing?

302
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,462
I would do anything
for your daughter,

303
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,098
but I destroyed
the Pit months ago.

304
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,534
Um, ok. Well, there's
got to be,

305
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,503
uh, something else.

306
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,171
I am so very sorry.

307
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,039
So you don't want
to help me.

308
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:29,347
Fine. I'll find some other way
to bring her back.

309
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,159
I've been scouring traffic
cameras for Evelyn,

310
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,361
but I keep
striking out.

311
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,229
What are you
doing here?

312
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,998
Thinking.

313
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,799
Which is
Oliver-speak

314
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,868
for beating
yourself up.

315
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,503
Thought you were
reformed from that.

316
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,106
Feels like as good
a time as any to bring it back.

317
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,208
Because of Laurel or because of what
the girl said?

318
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,010
Bit of both.

319
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,681
I tried to do the right thing,
and I came up short.

320
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,985
I came up short
for that girl...

321
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,456
And for Laurel.

322
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,093
Maybe I shouldn't
feel responsible, but I do.

323
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,228
Yeah.
It's going around.

324
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,363
You mean John?

325
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,832
- I mean me.
- Hmm?

326
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,002
John was looking
for someone to absolve him,

327
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:28,639
reassure him that what happened
wasn't his fault,

328
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,142
and I couldn't
do it.

329
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,345
I think for a second
I let him blame himself

330
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:39,750
because for a minute
it saved me from blaming me.

331
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,987
I should have
been there.

332
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,189
I wasn't there with the team
in the bunker.

333
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,058
I know I would have just been
behind a keyboard.

334
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,426
I know it seems
like hubris,

335
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,027
but I've made
a difference before,

336
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,763
and I can't help
think that if I was there,

337
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,700
you know, maybe
she'd still be here.

338
00:18:55,702 --> 00:19:01,072
Do you know why
I always blame myself

339
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,140
in situations
like this?

340
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,745
Because at least
it's an answer.

341
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,317
Sometimes, we just
need a reason

342
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,154
when a situation is
completely unreasonable.

343
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,464
Hello?

344
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,132
Lyla called
asking for John,

345
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,668
except he's supposed
to be checking in on her.

346
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,670
I'm getting
a bad feeling about this.

347
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,071
I have trackers
on all of you.

348
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,673
I'll check, and I'll get
back to you.

349
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,148
Well, tell
those curious

350
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,683
that the city has
undertaken

351
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,918
to do a massive upgrade
of the sewage system.

352
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,654
I mean, what happens
below ground

353
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,589
is simply not
their concern.

354
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,863
Why are we stopping?

355
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,097
Get down!

356
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,604
Get out!

357
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,172
What do you think
you're doing?

358
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,940
I am the mayor
of this city.

359
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,709
I don't care who you are!
You're gonna be a lot less

360
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,345
if you don't get out
of that limo right now!

361
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,047
Move.

362
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,819
Can I help you
with something?

363
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,655
I mean, I always enjoy spending time
with my constituents.

364
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,391
Shut up!
You know who I am.

365
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,627
You know exactly
who I am,

366
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,195
and you know where
my brother is!

367
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,430
I don't know what
you're talking about.

368
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,832
Stop lying!

369
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,234
Fine. We'll do this
your way.

370
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,470
Maybe you can give your
husband a message for me

371
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:43,040
and let him know I'm not
playing games with him anymore.

372
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,577
Get away from her, John.

373
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,913
Agh! Stay out
of my way!

374
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,881
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

375
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,216
Trying to find Andy!

376
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,351
By attacking
the mayor of the city?

377
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,986
By going after
Damien Darhk's wife!

378
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,722
It doesn't matter if
she's Darhk's wife.

379
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,925
She is the mayor. She has the media.
She has the police.

380
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,694
I don't give a damn!
Ugh!

381
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,132
I'm so angry,
I can hardly breathe.

382
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,334
I know.

383
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,770
Every minute he's
out there is a--

384
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,541
is a--is another minute
he can hurt someone I love.

385
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,944
John...

386
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,579
I know...

387
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,751
But this isn't
who you are.

388
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,141
I don't know--

389
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,615
I don't know who
I am anymore, Oliver.

390
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,592
All I know is,
all I can hold on to is that...

391
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,530
I have to find
my brother.

392
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,365
And--and--and
do what?

393
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,934
Laurel's gone,
and finding Andy

394
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,237
and whatever you're
gonna do to him,

395
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,272
it's not gonna
bring her back,

396
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,442
but if she were
here,

397
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,779
she'd tell you the same thing that
I'm gonna tell you.

398
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:58,115
You cannot forget
who you are,

399
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,416
and we...

400
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,821
We can never
become them.

401
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:31,849
Where have
you guys been?

402
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,784
Doesn't matter.

403
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,653
Have we had any luck
tracking down Evelyn Sharp?

404
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,122
No. I keep hitting
dead ends.

405
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,323
Not the best choice
of words.

406
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,059
News alert.

407
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:45,296
Tonight, my security
detail and I were attacked

408
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:48,465
by one of these
lawless vigilantes

409
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,435
who claim to protect
this city.

410
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,939
This attack came
less than 24 hours

411
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:58,809
after another vigilante
named the Black Canary

412
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:03,013
assaulted my chief of staff
Alex Davis.

413
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,483
Now these same
masked criminals

414
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,453
were confirmed to be
at Iron Heights

415
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:13,490
when one of this city's
beloved civil servants

416
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,194
Laurel Lance was
fatally injured.

417
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,997
Well, tonight,
I say no more!

418
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,567
Tonight, I asked
district attorney Wallace

419
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:27,738
to issue arrest warrants
for these so-called vigilantes,

420
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,409
beginning with Mr. Davis'
attacker the Black Canary.

421
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:41,190
We will dedicate the arrest

422
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:45,727
and prosecution of this
so-called Black Canary

423
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:49,284
to A.D.A. Laurel Lance,

424
00:23:49,286 --> 00:23:52,921
one of this city's
brightest lights.

425
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,856
Shut it off.

426
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:56,124
Thank you.

427
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,259
She knows Laurel was
the Black Canary.

428
00:23:58,261 --> 00:23:59,727
And now she has
the whole police force

429
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,063
gunning for a scared,
frightened teenage girl.

430
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,898
I'll call Alex.

431
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:09,737
Ok. We need to find
Evelyn before the SCPD does.

432
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,772
Yes.

433
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:18,012
Yeah?

434
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,720
Mr. Lance's agony
is understandable,

435
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:28,923
but its pain is
sharpened by denial.

436
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,726
I fear that--
that refusal to accept reality

437
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:33,928
will lead Mr. Lance
to take desperate action.

438
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,163
Thank you for
letting me know.

439
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:36,698
I will keep
an eye on him.

440
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
Oliver.

441
00:24:39,502 --> 00:24:41,336
Are you all right?

442
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:45,840
Our friend was killed
at the hands of a man

443
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:47,909
that I am currently
powerless to stop,

444
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:52,614
and his wife is dragging her legacy
through the mud.

445
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,948
Nyssa, after everything
that she's done,

446
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,084
after everything that
she's stood for,

447
00:24:56,086 --> 00:24:58,052
it just doesn't
seem right.

448
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,798
I'm glad you finally
decided to come over.

449
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,834
Well, it's been a week.

450
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,669
I feel like Tommy
would be pissed at me

451
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:17,505
if I didn't eventually
come out of my self-pity.

452
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,374
Heh. Yeah.

453
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,881
He loved you
so much.

454
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:28,349
This was right
after you won

455
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:30,885
student body president
our senior year.

456
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:33,988
Do you remember
how I won?

457
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,825
Of course. You were
the most deserving candidate by far.

458
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,596
Well, gift baskets encouraging people
to vote for me,

459
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:43,564
that didn't hurt either.

460
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,600
That was Tommy's idea.

461
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:52,707
No, but seriously,
it's easy

462
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:53,841
to buy people off
with money

463
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:57,478
that you didn't
even earn.

464
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,347
You did all
the hard work.

465
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,617
Hmm. We always did
make a great team.

466
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,720
Yeah.

467
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:10,258
You know, I was thinking
about what you said

468
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,727
in the hallway
after Tommy's funeral

469
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:16,431
and wanting to help
make the city a better place.

470
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:20,735
We still can.

471
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:25,006
Laurel Lance always
trying to save the world.

472
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:27,575
Yeah, but it doesn't
have to be just me.

473
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:31,446
You can, too.

474
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:33,181
We can do it together.

475
00:26:46,796 --> 00:26:49,397
I'm really excited
about the future, Ollie.

476
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:57,071
Wha--ohh.

477
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,573
There's no one
in there.

478
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,974
It's where the League
of Assassins hang

479
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:01,576
their black hoods.

480
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,944
No. That's right,
but there is no Lazarus Pit

481
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:04,312
and no League in there.

482
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:05,546
No, but there might
be something,

483
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:06,748
just some clue,
all right?

484
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,915
Next step
on the trail.

485
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,517
There's no trail,
Quentin!

486
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,552
Laurel is gone, and there is no
bringing her back.

487
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:12,754
No, no, no.
To hell with that,

488
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,222
and if you don't
want to help me,

489
00:27:14,224 --> 00:27:15,590
to hell with you,
too!

490
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,924
I am helping you.

491
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,559
No, you're not
because you know why?

492
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,194
Because you do not
know what it is like to lose a child.

493
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:21,763
No idea!

494
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,699
But I have lost a father,
I have lost a mother,

495
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:25,933
and I have lost Laurel!

496
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,602
We have lost her!

497
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,040
We have.

498
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,342
If there was a way,

499
00:27:34,344 --> 00:27:39,113
if there was any way
to bring her back,

500
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,415
I would find it,
and I would do it...

501
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,022
But there isn't
for either of us.

502
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,296
You don't understand.

503
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,631
When we lost Sara,
when I became a drunk,

504
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,999
when no one else
believed in me, she did.

505
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,634
She's always been there.

506
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,835
She's my rock!

507
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:02,236
I...

508
00:28:06,676 --> 00:28:09,544
She was my rock.

509
00:28:09,546 --> 00:28:11,012
I can't do this.

510
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:14,182
Oh, God. Oh, no.

511
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:16,984
I can't do this.

512
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:24,058
Oh, God.
She can't be gone.

513
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,829
- John.
- You got something?

514
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,898
Yeah, an apology.

515
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,369
I never should have
let you think that

516
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:38,706
you could have prevented what
happened to Laurel,

517
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,374
not even
for a second.

518
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:42,343
I was just dealing with my own guilt
for not being there.

519
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,580
You have nothing to be
sorry about, Felicity.

520
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:50,685
If I had listened to Oliver and not
trusted my brother,

521
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,286
Laurel would be alive.

522
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:53,988
You don't know that.

523
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,389
Oliver keeps saying
the same thing,

524
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:56,657
except I keep going
through this

525
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:58,125
over and over again
in my head,

526
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,294
and it--

527
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:02,163
it's true.

528
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:03,931
The only thing
I don't quite get

529
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,700
is how I could have
been so blind.

530
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,735
Well, Andy's your
brother, you know?

531
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:09,470
We make exceptions
for family.

532
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:11,639
Yeah...

533
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:13,407
And I'm the one
constantly telling Oliver

534
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:15,343
not to have a blind spot
for family.

535
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:17,578
And here you are taking
the blame for something

536
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,747
that's not your fault.

537
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,083
You're just one
illegitimate child away

538
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:26,954
from a really awesome Oliver Queen
impersonation,

539
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:28,522
but just like
we tell Oliver,

540
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:31,893
what happened
was not your fault,

541
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,897
and Laurel would have
wanted you to know that.

542
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:39,567
- What's that?
- Evelyn Sharp.

543
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,968
Facial recognition
picked her up outside

544
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,237
of Star City Plaza hotel.

545
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,839
What's she
doing there?

546
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:46,874
That's where
Ruvé Darhk is.

547
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:48,576
She's getting
revenge for her family.

548
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,945
Well, if she's gonna
kill Ruvé Darhk, my vote is yes.

549
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,280
It's not just
killing Ruvé Darhk.

550
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:54,148
In that mask,
in that costume,

551
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,883
she'd be killing
Laurel's legacy.

552
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,325
Keep your eyes peeled.

553
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:18,596
She's out there somewhere.

554
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:20,739
I'm on site.
There's no sign of Evelyn.

555
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:26,044
Yeah. So is the anti-vigilante
task force,

556
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:29,414
and they have come
ready to play.

557
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:31,416
We need to find
that girl before they do.

558
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:33,051
Hey!

559
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:34,219
I'm heading in.

560
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:41,560
Ma'am, you shouldn't
be in here.

561
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:42,928
Funny.

562
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,530
I was gonna tell you
the same thing.

563
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,374
The Black Canary
is in the building.

564
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,609
I need to get you
to a secure location.

565
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:59,678
Oh, you'll do
no such thing.

566
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,813
Let her come.

567
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:04,950
Let her try.

568
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:06,118
I found her.
Second floor,

569
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,586
200 feet from
the Liberty ballroom,

570
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:09,421
Ruvé Darhk, and a lot
of a lot of innocent people.

571
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:10,789
On it.

572
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:16,194
Unh!

573
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,535
Don't!

574
00:31:23,537 --> 00:31:25,837
Don't go in there.

575
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,873
Get away.

576
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,675
I can't do that.

577
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:32,411
You can't do this.

578
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,381
Now I know you want
revenge on HIVE

579
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:39,584
for what they did
to your parents,

580
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:41,086
but this isn't
the way.

581
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,021
It's the only way
I have left.

582
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,030
Evelyn, don't!

583
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:55,634
Agh!

584
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:58,870
You failed this city!

585
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:00,205
I understand that
you're trying

586
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:02,874
to make
things right.

587
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,510
That is not how you
get justice done.

588
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:09,181
What did you know
about the real Black Canary?

589
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:11,783
What did you know about what
she stood for?

590
00:32:11,785 --> 00:32:14,453
She was there that night.

591
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:16,121
I saw her.

592
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:18,557
Then you saw what kind
of person she was.

593
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,593
She was a hero.

594
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:25,864
Now maybe you are
wearing that mask for a reason,

595
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:29,401
but right now,
I need you to ask yourself

596
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:32,037
what would the Black Canary
want you to do?

597
00:32:46,753 --> 00:32:47,886
Come on.

598
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:59,631
Arrest him!

599
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,500
I've seen this
movie before.

600
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,422
No sign of Evelyn.

601
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:20,349
Kid must have found out
I was tracking her.

602
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,583
Really missed her out
there tonight.

603
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,718
In a way, she was
out there.

604
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,254
In spirit, I mean,
not in a Lazarus Pit kind of way,

605
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:30,224
and ultimately, she
made the right choice.

606
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:31,759
I think Laurel would have liked that
she inspired someone.

607
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,627
How can you
say that?

608
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:35,462
Evelyn Sharp just
destroyed

609
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:38,632
Laurel's memory
out there tonight.

610
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,267
Now the Black Canary's
only gonna be remembered

611
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,169
for whatever
Evelyn's done.

612
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:44,605
Evelyn's not
the Black Canary.

613
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,041
Well, to every reporter
and person with a camera

614
00:33:47,043 --> 00:33:49,210
in the room tonight,
she was.

615
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:53,447
Ruvé Darhk's gonna make sure
everybody sees that footage.

616
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,583
As far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

617
00:33:55,585 --> 00:34:01,021
the Black Canary is
now a gun-toting, would-be murderer.

618
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:02,690
I'm not gonna let
that happen.

619
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,161
Oh, Quentin.

620
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:10,364
I never thought
we'd be here again.

621
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:11,932
Me, neither.

622
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:15,402
I figured we were
punished enough first time around.

623
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:17,037
We were.

624
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,342
Oh, at least
for a while,

625
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:23,410
and then Sara
came back to us.

626
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,084
I don't think that's
gonna happen this time.

627
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:32,486
How can you
say that?

628
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,656
Our girls always
come back to us, Quentin.

629
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:38,892
Yeah, maybe before
but not this time.

630
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:41,028
I'm sorry, Dinah.
She's gone.

631
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:44,565
She's never
coming back.

632
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:48,702
She's...

633
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,939
Mr. Queen has
requested to say a few words.

634
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:07,554
This, uh...

635
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:09,056
This doesn't seem right.

636
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:12,293
Uh, I knew
Laurel Lance for...

637
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,431
Almost her entire life.

638
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:20,801
She was my friend,
and I loved her.

639
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:23,570
Before she died,
I was--I was lucky enough

640
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:28,375
to hear her tell me
that she loved me, too.

641
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:31,512
Laurel Lance became a lawyer
to help people

642
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:33,447
who may have appeared helpless.

643
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:36,050
She wanted to give
a voice to the silent,

644
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:40,621
but just being a lawyer
wasn't enough.

645
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:44,091
She wanted to do more
for those people

646
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:45,826
and for this city

647
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:48,796
because she loved
this city so much.

648
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:52,066
By now, everyone knows
that Laurel was killed

649
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,301
in the Iron Heights
prison riot,

650
00:35:54,303 --> 00:36:00,941
and while it's true that she was
an assistant district attorney,

651
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:03,310
that's not what she was
doing there that night.

652
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:05,946
Before she died,
Laurel told me the truth.

653
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:10,617
Laurel Lance was
the Black Canary.

654
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:17,124
In the past few days,

655
00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:19,360
I have had to sit
and listen to people

656
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:21,795
try and paint
the Black Canary as a criminal.

657
00:36:21,797 --> 00:36:23,197
She was not a criminal.

658
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,698
She was a hero.

659
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,668
She was a hero
in every way

660
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,003
that a person can be,

661
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:32,139
and if Laurel were here,

662
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,341
I know that she would
expect all of us

663
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:37,544
to live up to the example
that she set.

664
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:43,250
She'd want us
to save our city.

665
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,412
Oliver, voice-over: Dear Laurel,
I wrote this letter

666
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:12,713
because I don't
have the courage

667
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:15,382
to see the disappointment
on your face.

668
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:17,551
I know you're gonna go on
to do amazing things,

669
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:19,953
to help people, and to raise
this city up

670
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,321
because that's who you are,

671
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,589
that's who you've
always been,

672
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:25,025
and that's why I
have to go away.

673
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:26,760
I would only hold you back.

674
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:28,095
You're the hero, Laurel.

675
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,663
Maybe I'll come back eventually,

676
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:33,333
but for now, I have to
spend some time alone.

677
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,569
I hope someday you'll
understand my decision.

678
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:37,438
Never doubt my love for you.

679
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,339
You've always seen
the best in me

680
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,975
because you've always
been the best of me.

681
00:37:41,977 --> 00:37:44,411
All my love, Oliver.

682
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,968
I'm sorry I missed
the funeral.

683
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,703
- Zoom?
- Yeah.

684
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:12,206
There was a time I would have thought
this was my fault,

685
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,808
that I brought
this darkness upon us,

686
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,844
but now I know it's
not my fault.

687
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:18,779
It's my responsibility.

688
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:21,515
Responsibility
to do what?

689
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:23,484
To end it.

690
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:25,085
I'm gonna kill him.

691
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:27,387
Is there anything
I can do?

692
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,089
I want to be
left alone.

693
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:26,613
Are you ok?

694
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:30,817
Are you?

695
00:39:34,423 --> 00:39:36,523
No.

696
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:38,959
You know what you
have to do, right?

697
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:43,163
You have to kill
the son of a bitch.

698
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,832
I know.

699
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:50,904
I don't know how.

700
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:52,372
Because of his magic.

701
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:55,576
His ma--
it's too strong.

702
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:01,248
I've seen it before,
back on Lian Yu,

703
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,852
and it is not
just magic.

704
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,256
It's darkness,

705
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:11,358
and whenever I have
come up against it,

706
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,760
I have gone nowhere.

707
00:40:13,762 --> 00:40:15,195
It--

708
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:19,166
he feels
unstoppable.

709
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,468
I refuse to
believe that.

710
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,672
And I refuse to let
you believe that.

711
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:28,675
If Darhk wins,
Laurel died for nothing.

712
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,312
I fell in love with you
for many reasons,

713
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:36,450
and one of those reasons
is is that you always find a way,

714
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:39,219
and you have to find
a way now

715
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:41,054
for Laurel,

716
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:42,623
for the city...

717
00:40:45,828 --> 00:40:47,928
For all of us.

718
00:40:57,256 --> 00:41:03,756

719
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:23,241
Greg!
Move your head.
