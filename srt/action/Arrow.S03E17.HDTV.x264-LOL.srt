00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:15,805
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

164
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:21,509
Sorry to interfere
with your wedding night.

165
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:23,877
[Scoffs] Yeah,
I doubt that.

166
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,044
Five hours ago, there was
a terrorist attack

167
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,380
in the Republic of Kaznia.

168
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:32,049
Hospital was supposed to serve and
unite Kaznia's dissident ethnic faction.

169
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:32,787
Wait, is that...

170
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,547
Senator Joseph Cray.

171
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:37,417
This hospital was something
of a pet project for him.

172
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,017
Of course, he insisted
on being at the ceremony.

173
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,193
Agent Michaels, you'll lead
Task Force X on the extraction;

174
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,890
I'll have a plane
ready for you in 30 minutes.

175
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:49,194
I'm sorry, Johnny.

176
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,769
You go on to Fiji, and I
will meet you there

177
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,737
in 48 hours, tops.

178
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,472
No, you won't, because I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

179
00:07:57,474 --> 00:08:00,638
You remember what I told you
about not letting go?

180
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,403
I meant that.

181
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:06,904
Waller.

182
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:08,839
Count me in.

183
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,236
You have the two of us,
Deadshot, who else is on the team?

184
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,042
Who else indeed.

185
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:15,577
I've always wanted
to see the world.

186
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,605
I hear Kaznia's
beautiful this time of year.

187
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,757
Anything?

188
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,051
I'm accessing traffic cameras,
ATM cameras, phone cameras;

189
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:37,895
I'm hacked into 911
and squad car chatter.

190
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:38,896
And?

191
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,683
No sign of evil Arrow.

192
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:43,525
Los Alcones are unloading a huge
shipment of narcotics.

193
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,355
The entire gang
is going to show up for protection.

194
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,425
This is exactly the kind of thing
that fake Arrow would go after.

195
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,592
We really need
a better name for him.

196
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:51,055
- When is this happening?
- Right now.

197
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,791
- I'll suit up.
- Roy...

198
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,158
This is the League.

199
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,134
I've got it.

200
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,308
So did you hire
a florist?

201
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,477
Yes, we did.

202
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,444
Didn't that
cost a fortune?

203
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,009
At my wedding,
I'll have the bridesmaids

204
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,420
make the flower
arrangements

205
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:23,221
and I'll spend the extra money
on the dress.

206
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,625
Anything?

207
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,275
No, clear.

208
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:28,889
You seeing anybody, Cutter?

209
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,391
Of course I am.

210
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:31,840
The Arrow.

211
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,453
And our special day
is going to be

212
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:35,525
the most
glorious day.

213
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,958
And then afterwards,
we'll make strong,

214
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,733
beautiful babies.
[Chuckles]

215
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:42,931
And does he know this?

216
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,634
Listen, I got news
for you, stalker--

217
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,801
you don't get to do
what we do and have a family.

218
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,833
Yeah, well, I have a wife right here
and a child to say otherwise.

219
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,337
Let's hold up here.

220
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,809
Yeah, well, let's hope
you make it home to her.

221
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:55,944
But love, children, family--

222
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,207
it's all just a distraction
for people like us.

223
00:09:58,209 --> 00:09:59,606
They make us better,

224
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,310
and give us something
worth fighting for.

225
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:02,982
Love is a bullet in the brain,

226
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:04,310
and if you believe
any different,

227
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,285
you're as crazy as she is.

228
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:07,781
- Hey!
- All right.

229
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:11,686
Latest satellite flyover
reveals warm bodies here.

230
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:14,388
Yeah, that's pretty
solid. Fortified.

231
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,987
How are we going
to get everyone out?

232
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:19,121
Our orders are to retrieve Cray.
No one else.

233
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,688
What about
the hostages?

234
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,295
They're not U.S. citizens.

235
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,929
Are those your words
or Waller's, Lyla?

236
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,361
Let's not fight, Johnny.

237
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,001
It's our honeymoon.

238
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:31,365
See what I mean, John?

239
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:35,237
I'm not you, Lawton.

240
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,404
Yeah.

241
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:40,404
I wasn't always me,
either.

242
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:55,314
Just leave the package
at the door.

243
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:59,940
Ma'am, I, uh, I think you're going
to want to sign for these.

244
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,675
Ahh!

245
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:05,481
Oh, my God! Floyd!

246
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:13,684
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home?

247
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:14,852
I'm a mess!

248
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:18,523
No. No,
you're perfect.

249
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,893
Mommy, who is he?

250
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:33,060
Zoey, baby, this--

251
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:35,363
this is your daddy,
remember?

252
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,730
I told you about him.

253
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,233
He was far away,
fighting the bad guys.

254
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,536
Now he's home.

255
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:44,830
Hiya, Zoey.

256
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:46,038
You know,
your daddy missed you

257
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,943
every second
of every day.

258
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:53,208
She just...
needs some time.

259
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:59,489
I got him. Satellite footage of a man,
green outfit, green hood,

260
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:01,451
on the roof near the warehouse.
You have to hurry.

261
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:09,629
[Speaking Spanish]

262
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,892
[Both grunting]

263
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:50,498
[Man laughing]

264
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:56,167
[Grunting]

265
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:13,009
Maseo: You can't
kill them all, Oliver.

266
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:17,681
Where one falls,

267
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,649
two more arise.

268
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:21,151
Maseo...

269
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:23,551
You can't
believe in this!

270
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,518
Murdering all of these people
just to prove a point!

271
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,526
No. To persuade you.

272
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:32,556
My master sees
something in you.

273
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,627
Don't fight it.

274
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:35,961
Embrace it!

275
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,992
You know me
better than that.

276
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:42,797
Don't let your recalcitrance
take any more lives.

277
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,047
[Beeping]

278
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,436
[Door opens]

279
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:21,569
Ok, I had no idea
the sheer number of crazies

280
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:25,701
that were in this city until you set up
that 1-800 line for Arrow tips.

281
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:28,836
What's going on?

282
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,971
Ray?

283
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:36,144
Oliver Queen
is the Arrow.

284
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,976
What?

285
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,118
I have a 140 IQ
and three Ph.Ds,

286
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,116
it's pretty hard to
insult my intelligence,

287
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,650
but I think
you just did.

288
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,553
It all makes
sense now.

289
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,320
I mean, your, uh, sudden
disappearances,

290
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:57,591
your apprehension
with helping me on the mission;

291
00:14:57,593 --> 00:14:59,652
you've been working
with the Arrow this whole time.

292
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:02,322
How did you find out?

293
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,459
High spectrum
portable radiograph,

294
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:08,762
colloquially known
as the X-Ray machine.

295
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,424
Plus, your facial
recognition software.

296
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:11,832
Nice code,
by the way.

297
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,463
Hey, you got the suit working.

298
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:15,462
Hmm.

299
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,429
Last night, I saw
your friend Oliver

300
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,732
standing over eight
of his victims.

301
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:22,269
Because he was investigating.

302
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:23,942
He's trying to catch
an impersonator,

303
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:25,544
the one who's really
doing this.

304
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:29,584
Please, you have to trust me.
Oliver's not a killer.

305
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:32,681
This isn't the first time he's been judge,
jury and executioner.

306
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,719
He hasn't killed anyone
in nearly two years.

307
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:36,517
That really is not
your best argument.

308
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,153
You have no idea
what he's been through!

309
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,049
What he's lost,
how he's grown,

310
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,488
but I do. I know him
better than almost...

311
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,023
anyone.

312
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,986
Oliver didn't do this.

313
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,751
You have
feelings for him.

314
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:53,347
Yes. I mean...

315
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:56,385
No. No!

316
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:58,154
I did.

317
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,426
But that's...

318
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:01,755
that's over now.

319
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,499
And, what?

320
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,298
Now I'm supposed to trust you?

321
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,602
From the moment we met,
I've held nothing back from you.

322
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:12,665
I did trust you.

323
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,904
And I thought that
you were someone

324
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,732
who could be a true partner;

325
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:20,503
that you were someone
that I could rely on

326
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:24,732
in the mission,
and in my life.

327
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,304
I wanted that, too,
Ray, I still do.

328
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:32,500
Ray!

329
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,530
What are you
going to do?

330
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:37,704
I'm going to honor
the promise I made to this city

331
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,407
and help them bring
the Arrow to justice.

333
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:09,528
Lyla: Nice work, Deadshot.
We're en route. Move to the X.

334
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,559
Copy that.

335
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,535
Here you go,
sweetie.

336
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:23,172
Eat it.

337
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:27,371
You don't want
to eat it?

338
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,372
There's something
wrong with it?

339
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:31,579
What, it's not as good as mom
makes, I guess?

340
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:34,916
Use your words!

341
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:36,148
Hmm?

342
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,317
Baby! What's going on?

343
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,621
Nothing, I'm fine.

344
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,819
No, you're not fine.

345
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:43,552
[Groans]

346
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:47,357
You're not sleeping,
you barely eat.

347
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,925
You can't hold a job,
you can't socialize.

348
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:53,027
You won't talk to me.

349
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,657
We're talkin'
right now.

350
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,192
So tell me, what do you want
to talk about?

351
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,728
I want to know what happened
to my husband!

352
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,696
You need to tell
your story.

353
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,569
There are people
who can help you.

354
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,865
People who know what it's like to
come back from war.

355
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:09,039
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

356
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,063
Nobody understands,
do you hear me?!

357
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:14,430
So make them
understand.

358
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,765
Oh, make them understand.

359
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,404
Like this?

360
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,299
You want to make them
understand like that?

361
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,035
How about like this, huh?!

362
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:23,139
Do you want to know
what happened to your husband?

363
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:26,075
Let me tell ya--
he pulled triggers.

364
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:28,676
And every time he did,
someone died!

365
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:31,316
Ok, every single time.

366
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,781
Lawton...

367
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,620
Stop it.

368
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:38,788
Please.

369
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:46,533
[Groans]

370
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,431
Get away from us!

371
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,334
[Dials 911]

372
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:52,605
Yes, this is
an emergency.

373
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:55,907
It's my husband.
He has a gun.

374
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,718
Find anything
on those arrows?

375
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,156
[Sighs] This one is ours.
This one is theirs.

376
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:12,090
I don't see a difference.

377
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:15,193
Yeah, precisely.
They're identical.

378
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,624
He knows.

379
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,960
God, he knows.

380
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,161
Last year,
Ray's fiancée

381
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,529
was killed
by Mirakuru men.

382
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,497
And now he wants
to protect the city,

383
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,464
so he built a suit
out of military-grade technology

384
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,000
and he wants
to put you in jail,

385
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,168
so he used my software
to track you down,

386
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,801
and he scanned you
with his X-Rays

387
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:37,169
and now he knows that
you're the Arrow

388
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:38,537
and he's going
to tell the cops.

389
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,672
Palmer knows I'm the Arrow?

390
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,639
And he has his own mission
to protect the city?

391
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,880
When were you going
to tell me this?!

392
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,481
I have been getting
a lot of that today.

393
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:52,289
Look, it's not important.
Here's what is--

394
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,921
he's going to tell the police
who you are!

395
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,857
Wait, Ray built a super suit?

396
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,488
That's kind of awesome.

397
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,527
And reckless.

398
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:02,525
Look, he's probably on his way to
the precinct right now.

399
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,060
What are we going to do?

400
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:09,735
The radiography technology
is infallible.

401
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:12,071
These are screenshots
of the output with timestamps.

402
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:14,975
That's a very bold
claim, Mr. Palmer.

403
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:17,007
Especially since we've already
been down that road

404
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,111
two years ago when Oliver Queen
was exonerated.

405
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:20,164
'Cause he's smart.

406
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:22,188
See, I believe he allowed
himself to be accused

407
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:25,213
so as to be ruled out
as a suspect in the future.

408
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:29,717
And your proof is...

409
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,756
X-ray vision?

410
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:33,891
Digital images
can be fabricated,

411
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,723
and I can't go to a judge
with any of that.

412
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,123
What about my statement?

413
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,132
You mean
your uncorroborated testimony?

414

[Scoffs]

415
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,270
You're protecting him.

416
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,438
Of course. Because you
and Oliver are old friends.

417
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,911
You, uh, hurt yourself
signing depositions?

418
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,412
At the gym,
actually.

419
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:56,714
Right, you were training
with that, um,

420
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,245
Wildcat Grant, right?
The one who also

421
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,339
used to be a vigilante.

422
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,776
You and Oliver Queen
used to be a couple, right?

423
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:07,845
How is it you both
ended up wearing masks?

424
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:12,011
A word of free legal
advice, Mr. Palmer...

425
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:13,914
If you go to anyone
else, particularly the media,

426
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,544
with these
unsubstantiated allegations,

427
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:20,750
Mr. Queen would have the basis
for a slam dunk defamation suit

428
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,582
that would
leave you bankrupt.

429
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:26,787
Who knows, he might even
get his company back.

430
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,879
Yeah, you're right.

431
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:31,149

to be able to help me here.

[Exhales]

433
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:38,418
Guess I'll just have
to seek out justice on my own.

00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:55,903
Don't worry.

435
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:58,071
I'm a United
States senator.

Everything's going
to be all right.

to send anybody.

have come here.

You shouldn't
have come here.

Take off that shirt.

The bullet was a through and through,
I ain't going to die.

Mockingbird, this is Harbinger
on emergency frequency Delta Charlie.

Task Force X is broadcasting
in the blind, over.

Damn it! It's not
going through.

I think our signal's
being jammed.

Harbinger, this is Senator Cray.

00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:08,214
Well, I imagine
you must all be feeling,

471
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:11,635
uh, a little bit
confused right about now.

472
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:14,609
This is a hostage situation.
A terrorist attack!

473
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:18,640
Well, actually, they're not terrorists,
they're mercenaries.

474
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:20,840
They work for me.

475
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,377
Why would you do that?

476
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,216
Because I love
my country,

477
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:26,784
and my country
loves a hero.

478
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:29,583
So this was
all theater?

479
00:24:29,585 --> 00:24:31,751
So you could, what,
run for president?

480
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:34,622
There it is.
The big picture.

481
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:37,589

my poll numbers will be

00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:41,324
once I heroically defuse
this tragic situation?

483
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,091
Everybody here

484
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:45,330
was supposed
to go home alive.

485
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,497
That was the whole point.

486
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:49,296
But now, unfortunately,

487
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:52,932
you have turned
my hostages into witnesses,

488
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,500
and I can't have that.

489
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:56,668
I'm going to kill you slow,
you son of a bitch.

490
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,772
You're outgunned
and outnumbered.

491
00:24:58,774 --> 00:25:01,003
But if it's any consolation,

492
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:03,408
I am going to nominate
the four of you

493
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,145
for the Medal of Honor
once I'm president.

494
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:09,311
You'll be remembered
as heroes.

495
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:15,614
Okay.

496
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:22,190
Huh.

497
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:23,822
Arrow.

498
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:26,158
Super Suit.

499
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,590
I prefer "The Atom."

500
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,830
You know,
I have to admit,

501
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,462
I was a little
surprised to find you

502
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:32,630
on my calendar this morning.
Find the place all right?

503
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,167
Laurel Lance called me.

504
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:36,005
Yeah, the Black Canary.

505
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,666
She tried to shut me up,
but it's not going to work.

506
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:39,937
I didn't kill those people.

507
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,840
Yeah, that's what
Felicity said.

508
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,537
An impersonator,
right?

509
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:47,145
[Chuckles] I hate
when that happens.

510
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:53,147
Five years on
a deserted island.

511
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,386
That kind of thing
changes you,

512
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,450
doesn't it?

513
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:58,154
Must have been
difficult,

514
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:02,323
if not impossible to hold on
to your sanity all those years.

515
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:05,856
And now here you are, pretending you
have everything in control.

516
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,958
Felicity told you the truth.

517
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,425
And you should
trust her judgment.

518
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:14,662
How can I do that?

519
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:16,493
Her perception
of you is clearly clouded

520
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:18,396
by her emotional
attachment.

521
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:20,892
She's not seeing you
for what you really are.

522
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,300
You have no idea
what this city is up against.

523
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:28,869
Actually,
I think I do,

524
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:31,676
and I'm going to stop him.

525
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:37,877
It's clear.

526
00:26:44,181 --> 00:26:46,010
Reinforcements
just arrived.

527
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:48,373
I see them. Wait.

528
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,646
[Beeping]

529
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:52,848
- Oh, God.
- What, what, what, what?!

530
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:56,383
Thermal strikes. Here,
here, here, and here.

531
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,526
They've rigged the hospital
with explosive charges.

532
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:02,557
Killing all
our hostages.

533
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,795
With Cray as
the lone survivor.

534
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:11,298
Why did we come here?

535
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,264
We accepted the mission,
Lyla. We did what soldiers do.

536
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,199
Except we're not just
soldiers, Johnny.

537
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,934
We're parents.

538
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:22,205
I know parents who won't
even fly together

539
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,868
because they don't
want to risk orphaning their child.

540
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,772
What were we thinking?

541
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:30,213
Oh, God.

542
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:32,243
Our baby girl.

543
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:33,747
Lawton was right.

544
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:36,052
Can you please
say that again?

545
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:40,618
Sorry, I, uh, I didn't quite hear
you the first time.

546
00:27:43,588 --> 00:27:46,458
The Greddians have
rigged the hospital to blow.

547
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:49,763
We're not going
to make it.

548
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:51,900
Yeah. Yes, we are.

549
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:54,269
We're going to get
these hostages out.

550
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:59,777
And you and John are going to make it home
to your daughter again.

551
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,112
You got it?

552
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:02,815
Yeah.

553
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:06,949
Oh, the things I want
to do to you right now.

554
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,967
Floyd Lawton.

555
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:24,632
Who's asking?

556
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:27,640
Wasn't a question,
merely an acknowledgment.

557
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,577
We've posted your bail.

558
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:31,241
- We?
- An organization

559
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,778
in need of your very
particular talent.

560
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,578
Talent? [Scoffs]

561
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,913
Killin' people,
you mean.

562
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:42,089
And we will pay handsomely
for the use of those skills.

563
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:45,858
Again with the "we."

564
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,890
Who are you?

565
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,827
Merely a drone.

566
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,203
A piece of a larger entity.

567
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:56,465
We exist as one organism.

568
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,633
As you might say, a hive.

569
00:28:58,635 --> 00:29:01,978
Well, listen up, honey bee.
I'm done shootin'.

570
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,411
[Sighs]

571
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:06,241
I left that life
on the battlefield to come home,

572
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,176
be with my family.

573
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:10,647
I imagine the restraining order
your wife filed against you

574
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,384
impedes that plan somewhat.

575
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:16,455
You'll never be allowed
near her or your daughter again.

576
00:29:16,457 --> 00:29:18,823
You have left
the battlefield.

577
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:22,024
But the battlefield
never leaves you.

578
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,232
People like you don't get
to have a love.

579
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:27,398
Children, families.

580
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,230
These are just distractions
to people like you.

581
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:33,038
For people like you,

582
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,238
love is a bullet
in the brain.

583
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,444
Who's my target?

584
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:49,051
His name is Andrew Diggle.

585
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,462
How'd it go
with Ray?

586
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:10,263
Not well. Yeah,
your new boyfriend is stubborn.

587
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:12,704
Once he's made his mind up,
that's the end of it.

588
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:14,769
Sound like
anybody we know?

589
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,346
Not only is he untrained,
he's unstable.

590
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:21,377
- Unstable?
- Yeah, yes, he's unstable,

591
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:23,416
Felicity, because
he's flying around

592
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:28,284
in a weapon looking for a man
that has already killed 8 people!

593
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,913
He's going to be next.

594
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,415
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

595
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,950
Excuse me?

596
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:38,699
You never wanted me
to be with him.

597
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,400
Now, that's not true.

598
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:40,017
Yes, it is.

599
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,585
All that talk about wanting me to be
happy was just talk.

600
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:45,321
No, I meant what I said,
right up to the point where I found out

601
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:47,394
that he is just like me.

602
00:30:47,396 --> 00:30:49,322
You deserve better.

603
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:51,097
What I deserve...

604
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,464
Is to be with someone
who isn't afraid of being happy.

605
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:00,106
Ray told me he wanted
a true partner--

606
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:03,105
in his work, in his mission,
and in his life.

607
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:05,874
Ray wants to be a hero
and a human being.

608
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,976
Yes, 'cause he hasn't
realized yet that he can't be.

609
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:10,407
I told you

610
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,581
that I couldn't be with you

611
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:15,613
and save the city.

612
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:18,582
Neither can Ray.

613
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,483
He's just too new at this
to know that.

614
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,292
What's that?

615
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:28,429
911 call, suspected
gang activity

616
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:29,829
at Meltzer
Power Plant.

617
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:31,966
[Sighs] This could be
Maseo's next target.

618
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:35,102
Call Roy. Tell him to suit up and meet
me at the power plant.

619
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:49,447
There's no one here.

620
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:55,754
Ray: That must be
disappointing.

621
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,920
I'm sorry there's
no one around here for you to kill,

622
00:31:57,922 --> 00:32:00,577
but, uh, I kind of
faked that 911 call.

623
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:01,258
Palmer...

624
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:04,161
I'd say you have the right to remain
silent, but I'm not a cop.

625
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:05,729
[Beeping]

626
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,127
Ray: It's over.

627
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:48,061
That's it.
Nice and easy.

628
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:07,879
The man you think I am,

629
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:10,785
he'd kill you here and now.

630
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:14,355
I told you to back off,

631
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:16,024
and you didn't listen!

632
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:18,191
So kill me,
go ahead.

633
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:21,127
Show Felicity the kind of man
you really are.

634
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:26,401
I have nothing
to prove to her.

635
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,936
But you do.

636
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:40,786
She chose you.

637
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:43,788
So trust her.

638
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:58,009
[Beeping]

639
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:03,277
I am, uh,

640
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,013
I am truly sorry.

641
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:11,250
Everything was supposed
to work out differently.

642
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:15,111

643
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:25,648
Stop! Or I flip this switch and I blow us
all right to hell right now!

644
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,116
You're bluffing!

645
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:29,343
You die right along
with us.

646
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:32,273
I want to be president
for my legacy.

647
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:36,413
Dying a hero is as good
a consolation prize as any.

648
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:52,949
The Suicide Squad.

649
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,188
Well, you are true
to your name

650
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,557
if you think that
the three of you

651
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,029
can just shoot
your way in here...

652
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,834
Wait.

653
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,834
There were four of you.

654
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:18,842
John, 7 o'clock!

655
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,659
You've been a very,
very bad boy.

656
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:39,795
Go, go, go, everybody
go, go, go!

657
00:35:39,797 --> 00:35:41,762
Go, go, go, go!

658
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,199
Go, move it, move it,
move it, move it!

659
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,260
Move, move!

660
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:49,097
Come on, let's go!

661
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,097
Quickly!

662
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,432
Floyd, what about you, baby,
how are you getting out?

663
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:56,105
Floyd: I'm not.

664
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:58,105
Lawton, what are you talking about?
That wasn't part of the plan!

665
00:35:58,107 --> 00:35:59,673
You said you could
find your way down.

666
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:01,672
Yeah, I lied.

667
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:03,712
Someone needs to
cover your escape.

668
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:06,279
Me up here is what gets you out
down here alive.

669
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:07,382
Why?

670
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:08,982
You and your new wife,

671
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:12,518
you just get back
to your baby girl, all right, John?

672
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,687
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

673
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:20,298
Move, move!

674
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,335
Go, go, go, go,
move it, move, move!

675
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,813
Go, come on,
go, go, go, go!

676
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:37,053
[All yelling]

677
00:36:47,861 --> 00:36:49,826
[Beeping]

678
00:36:49,828 --> 00:36:50,889
[Explosion]

679
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:53,926
No! No!

680
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:11,067
How are you?

681
00:37:14,437 --> 00:37:16,643
My ego's bruised,

682
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:18,138
and...

683
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,472
My arm, and my back,
and my rotator cuff.

684
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,711
I'm so sorry about...

685
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:29,078
All of this.

686
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,582
Ahh. Well,
actually, I...

687
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:34,485
think I'm the one who
owes you an apology.

688
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:36,790
You told me Oliver
was innocent,

689
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,655
and I didn't
trust you.

690
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:41,128
I want you to know
that I do.

691
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:45,233
About what
you said earlier...

692
00:37:45,235 --> 00:37:48,904
about wanting a true partner.

693
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:53,704
Is that offer still good?

694
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:55,975
Yeah.

695
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:58,810
Once I make
an offer--

696
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:08,381
Woman on TV: The Greddian
separatists were led by Floyd Lawton,

697
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:11,147
a former sniper
for the United States' army.

698
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:13,778
Lawton was discharged
five years ago,

699
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,849
and since then has been linked
to numerous terrorist organizations.

700
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,817
Lawton died as a result

701
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,689
of an explosion intended
for a group of hostages,

702
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:25,826
including senator Joseph Cray.
But Cray managed--

703
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:27,994
He paid the hostages
for their silence.

704
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:31,033
Yeah, well, the dollar
goes a long way in Kaznia, right?

705
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:34,736
I tried to set
the record straight.

706
00:38:34,738 --> 00:38:38,334
Waller blocked me.

707
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,405
Johnny.

708
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:42,205
There's
something else.

709
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:45,175
Yes, there is.

710
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:54,982
I'm leaving team Arrow.

711
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:55,620
What?!

712
00:38:55,644 --> 00:38:56,991
Lawton was right.

713
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,856
I can't keep
living like this.

714
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:02,929
It only works until it
doesn't, and...[Sighs]

715
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:05,769
Then what?

716
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:07,536
I can't do that to Sara.

717
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:10,368
And what about
this city?

718
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,905
The work you
and Oliver do,

719
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:15,145
it's good work.

720
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:18,775
Not like what I've been doing
for far too long.

721
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,910
Which is why...

722
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:23,918
I resigned.

723
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,580
Lyla! No,
you love your job,

724
00:39:26,582 --> 00:39:28,220
and you're damn good at it.

725
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:29,918
No, if what happened
with Cray can be allowed to stand,

726
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,358
I don't want
to be good at it.

727
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,895
What I want is to
set a good example

728
00:39:33,897 --> 00:39:36,526
for our daughter.

729
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:38,726
I want her to be
proud of me.

730
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:41,302
Lyla...

731
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:43,998
I'm proud of you.

732
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,406
I'm proud of you, Lyla.

733
00:39:46,408 --> 00:39:49,909
Nothing's ever going
to change that.

734
00:39:58,124 --> 00:39:59,051
Hey.

735
00:39:59,054 --> 00:40:01,261
Hi. Where are
you off to?

736
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:03,124
Ray has a meeting
with the mayor.

737
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:05,963
Seems he's had a change
of heart about the Arrow.

738
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:07,098
Ohh.

739
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,042
Thanks.

740
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:09,664
For what?

741
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:12,031
For proving me right.

742
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,766
Hey.

743
00:40:19,768 --> 00:40:20,436
Hi.

744
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,533
What'd I miss?

745
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:24,299
Ohh, not much.

746
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:26,129
I'm glad
you're back.

747
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:27,696
So am I.

748
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:31,633
Turns out Lyla and I
are not very good at vacations.

749
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:33,537
Republic of Kaznia, huh?

750
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,937
Mm-hmm.

751
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:38,113
And Floyd Lawton?

752
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:39,777
Yeah.

753
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,944
You were right, Oliver.

754
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:44,478
Doing what we do,

755
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,246
having loved ones at home...

756
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,116
It's complicated.

757
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:52,785
Well, the things
that matter always are.

758
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,446
To Floyd Lawton.

759

00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:04,981
Any luck finding
your imposter?

761
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:06,284
Still out there.

762
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:08,156
Oliver, we have
to stop this guy

763
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:10,124
before he puts arrows
in any more criminals.

764
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:12,523
Or...before he
starts putting them

765
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:14,154
in innocent people.

766
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:19,761
Madame Mayor, I have it on
good authority that he's been set up.

767
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:21,432
Hold on a second, Ray.
Now you're

768
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,128
telling me you think the Arrow
is innocent?

769
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,769
Of these murders, yes.
I believe he's being framed.

770
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:28,506
We need to address
the media right away.

771
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:30,841
Tell 'em what, some
rich genius just changed his mind?

772
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:32,609
Captain, I think you're letting
your personal feelings

773
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:34,945
towards the Arrow
cloud your judgments.

774
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:37,479
Maybe I'm seeing things more clearly
than I have for the last few years.

775
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:39,582
Enough, both of you!
I am tired of listening--
