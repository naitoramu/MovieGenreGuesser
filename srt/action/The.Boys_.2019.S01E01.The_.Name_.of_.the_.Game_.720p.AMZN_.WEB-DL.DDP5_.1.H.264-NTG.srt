1
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:32,871
Yo, I am so psyched
for Invisible Force 2.

2
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,578
Please.
Invisible Force 1 was lame.

3
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,251
I'm all about Rising Tide.

4
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:39,578
Rising Tide? The Deep?

5
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,476
- Uh-huh.
- Translucent could kick the Deep's ass.

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,130
How? He's invisible.

7
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:44,749
That's, like, all he's got.
That's it.

8
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,005
Exactly.
He sneaks up on the Deep,

9
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,757
and then boom, motherfucker!

10
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,439
- Sit down.
- Until the Deep makes a shark

11
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,338
bite Translucent's dick off.

12
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,346
How's he gonna find his dick?
It's invisible.

13
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,522
Holy shit.

14
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,783
Benjy!

15
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,558
Get up. Get up, get up, get up.

16
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,422
Come on, Benjy.
Come on, come on.

17
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,324
Stay back.

18
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,866
Just stay the fuck back.

19
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,536
What are you smiling at?

20
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,101
Homelander?

21
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,812
You boys okay?

22
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,982
Can I... can I get a selfie?

23
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,395
Course you can.

24
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,366
The Seven's Queen Maeve
and Homelander

25
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,077
made another heroic save today,

26
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,578
stopping
a hijacked armored truck

27
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,948
on the streets of Brooklyn,

28
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,445
then staying behind
for a photo op

29
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,932
- with some very lucky fans.
- Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,536
- Jean?
- Thanks, Jennifer. And now...

31
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,173
So, this is pretty much

32
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,049
everything in one.
Bluetooth speakers.

33
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,667
It's in stereo,
so you can put it

34
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,275
all around your living room,
have some fun with it.

35
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,179
You said you have
a standard cable box, right?

36
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,927
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, then I need to get you an audio transmitter,

37
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,430
aptX Low Latency.

38
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,101
It makes it
so there's less audio lag,

39
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,850
and it's got
a standard optical in.

40
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,602
And let's hook you up
with thousand-meg HDMI.

41
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,734
Let's go with this one.

42
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,310
Uh, it costs a little bit more,

43
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,065
but the carbon's
way more conductive.

44
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,749
Hey, Gary. Um...

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,767
- I really need to talk to you about something.
- Later, kid.

46
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,631
Okay. Cool.

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,798
Later... you want, like...
want, like, 30-30 minutes?

48
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,258
Like, a solid 45?

49
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,011
Excuse me, sir?

50
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,474
Hi. I'd like
to make an appointment

51
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,524
for you to come over and...

52
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,348
lay some cable.

53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,194
Okay. Uh... oh, Robin.

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,860
Oh, dear, dear, Robin.

55
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:55,109
Um, that doesn't mean
what you think it means.

56
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,032
Um, "laying cable" means sex.

57
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,952
No, "laying pipe" means sex.

58
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,330
"Laying cable" means

59
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,077
you want me
to come over to your house

60
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,763
and just take a big, old shit.

61
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,827
- That's disgusting.
- Well, okay.

62
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,252
But you...
Who-who said it, though?

63
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,790
Okay. Are you ready?
Despite your best efforts,

64
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,884
I'm actually still hungry.

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,210
I'm actually more hungry now.

66
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,675
- Where are we gonna go after all this hot talk?
- I don't know.

67
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,111
- You know?
- More importantly, where are we gonna go

68
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,845
to lay some cable afterwards?

69
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,177
Geez.

70
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,852
So, did you ask him?

71
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,390
- Who?
- Gary.

72
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,604
Did you ask Gary for the raise?

73
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,646
Yeah. Yeah. It was... it was a...

74
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,070
Look, it was a crazy day,
and-and he was super busy,

75
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,779
but tomorrow for sure. Yes.

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,780
Okay.

77
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,372
What was I supposed to do,
kick his door down?

78
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,368
Like Homelander?

79
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,740
I said "okay."

80
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,326
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

81
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,961
Hey, I see the look.

82
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,868
I see it. Come on.

83
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,134
This is like when
we started dating.

84
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,591
I don't think that's...
I don't think that's true.

85
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,012
Dude, I had to ask you out.

86
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,431
Well, excuse me for waiting.

87
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,310
You ever hear of chivalry?

88
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,267
Listen, this is about you
getting what you deserve.

89
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,978
I'm killing myself at school

90
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,189
because I think it's gonna be
worth it for both of us.

91
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,980
You know,
if we move in together.

92
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,985
Wait, what? What?
W-W-Wait. Hey, hey, hey.

93
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,277
Hey, hey. What was that?

94
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,239
What'd you just say?

95
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,070
Well, I mean, we can't keep,
you know, laying pipe

96
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,834
at your dad's place.

97
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,488
Trying to be all quiet.

98
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,326
Staring up at that dumb
Billy Joel post...

99
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,804
- ...poster.
- Hey.

100
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,049
Don't you ever besmirch
Billy Jo...

101
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,126
I can't stop. I can't stop.
I can't stop. I can't stop.

102
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,460
Can't stop. Can't stop.

103
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,509
Robin?

104
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,015
Robin?

105
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,061
Robin!

106
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,017
Robin!

107
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,138
Let the energy
go through the wall.

108
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,021
I am Starlight.

109
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,185
I'm 110 pounds,
and I'm five foot six.

110
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,235
Turn around, please.

111
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,912
Okay. Let's see it, dear.

112
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,754
- You should look away.
- Sorry?

113
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,420
You should turn away
from the camera,

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,588
and you should close your eyes,
or else I'll blind you.

115
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,508
All right.

116
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,547
Okay, go ahead.

117
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,191
I am so sorry.

118
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,476
Are you all right?

119
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,821
I was born Super-Abled.

120
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,188
Uh, my mom was thrilled.

121
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:09,105
She took me to all
the little miss hero pageants,

122
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,736
but I hated it.

123
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,162
Ugh, I mean, I can still...

124
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,792
smell the hairspray.

125
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,119
Uh, but...

126
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,626
...at the Q and A, they always
asked me what my wish was,

127
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,970
and I always said,
"to save the world."

128
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,888
And the judges just chuckled

129
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,218
like it was cute.

130
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,273
But it wasn't a joke to me.

131
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:43,274
Since when
did "hopeful" and "naive"

132
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,605
become the same thing?

133
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,401
I mean, why would you
get into this business

134
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,365
if not to save the world?

135
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,076
That's all I have ever wanted.

136
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,826
And that's why
I've always wanted

137
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,004
to be in The Seven.

138
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,389
Thanks, Jennifer.

139
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,102
Thought Robin's service
was nice.

140
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,193
Did you see
how many people came?

141
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,230
Wow.

142
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,281
Lot of respect for that girl.

143
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,778
Lot of love in the room.

144
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,451
And the spread. What a spread.

145
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,990
Just really nice.

146
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,913
That does not begin to convey

147
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,333
the terrible regret...

148
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,682
Aw, geez.
Maybe there's a movie on.

149
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,100
- No, keep it.
- No, we can switch it.

150
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,754
Keep it.

151
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,502
...awful, tragic loss.

152
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,916
My deepest condolences
to Robin Ward's family.

153
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,716
I was chasing
these bank robbers.

154
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,350
She just stepped
in the middle of the street,

155
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,518
and I-I couldn't...

156
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,977
Middle of the...

157
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,557
She was a half step
off the fucking curb.

158
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,902
Oh, now, come on, Hughie.

159
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,727
Just, uh, don't get upset, okay?
Just...

160
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,522
He knows.

161
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,085
...swift,
thoughtful attention...

162
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,608
Now I think that A-Train
would like to get back to work.

163
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,366
Everyone at Vought is just...

164
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,578
just wrecked about Robin.

165
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,619
Now, you two weren't married,
and look,

166
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,415
technically,
there's no legal claim.

167
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,710
But...

168
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,263
Vought wants to do
the right thing:

169
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,627
offer you $45,000
in restitution.

170
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,014
All you have to do is sign

171
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,224
right here,

172
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,273
and I'll offer you the check.

173
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,269
This is
a confidentiality agreement.

174
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,152
It's a boilerplate NDA.

175
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,149
I sign this, and...

176
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,942
I can't talk about it?

177
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,946
Have to pretend
like it didn't happen,

178
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,118
like I wasn't holding
Robin's arms in my hands?

179
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,078
Look, I know you're upset,

180
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,078
but we're just trying to help.

181
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,580
Then say you're sorry.

182
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,043
Excuse me?

183
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,713
I mean, you people say
"our condolences"

184
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,752
and "my sympathies"
and "our regrets,"

185
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,796
but nobody can look me
in the fucking eye

186
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,629
and say "I'm sorry."

187
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,925
I'm not signing anything.
Get out.

188
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,680
I said get the hell out!

189
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,646
You okay?

190
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:35,735
As I said,
boilerplate NDA, really.

191
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,739
Pretty standard stuff.

192
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,411
Can I think about it?

193
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,661
If you have
any questions at all,

194
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,495
just, uh...

195
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,429
Unit 44, code 20.

196
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,467
Address is 1420 63rd Street...

197
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,471
Any maniacs out there?

198
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,175
Mm-mm. Quiet night.

199
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,725
Like every night.

200
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,598
That's too bad.

201
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,645
We could really use the press
right now.

202
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,895
Oh, Annie.

203
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,863
I'm hungry.

204
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,863
Don't worry.
I didn't get the job.

205
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,195
You don't know that.

206
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,201
They're auditioning girls
nationwide.

207
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,914
Besides,
Countess probably got it.

208
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,914
She's so good in a room.

209
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,996
If you're negative,
negative things happen to you.

210
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,803
Hello?

211
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,797
Yes, I'm her mother.

212
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,510
Uh, yes. Uh...

213
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,141
uh, one moment.

214
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,758
It's them.

215
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,014
It's them.

216
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,265
Hello?

217
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,266
Yes, this is she.

218
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,811
I got it?

219
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,356
You got it!

220
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,399
You got it!

221
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,322
Shh.

222
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,030
Oh, my God.

223
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,661
Uh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

224
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,618
It's a weird connection.

225
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,118
I don't know what that was,
actually.

226
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,330
Uh... Mm-hmm.

227
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,120
Oh, shit.

228
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,325
Yeah?

229
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,004
I think she was an addict.

230
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,383
Needle tracks?

231
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,709
12 marks on one arm.

232
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,375
More dope coming in.

233
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,512
More pushers at work.

234
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
What you doing?

235
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,722
Can't file a criminal case

236
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,114
against A-Train.
Supes are like cops.

237
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,638
They can't be charged

238
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,641
- for damages while they're on the job.
- Okay.

239
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,393
But maybe we can file
a wrongful death.

240
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,355
I just got to get Robin's
parents to sign off on it.

241
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,396
- Hughie, come sit with me.
- Dad, I'm not...

242
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,531
I'm right...

243
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,568
Okay.

244
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,002
Good for you.

245
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,037
You want to make this right,
what happened to Robin.

246
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,213
But you can't.

247
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,714
So sign this.

248
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,680
What?

249
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,637
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

250
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,678
We could really use it.

251
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,102
I can't... Dad, they killed her.

252
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,812
Be realistic, okay?

253
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,352
Even if we could pay
for a lawyer...

254
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,686
and that's a big if...
there's no case.

255
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,111
She was in the street.

256
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,739
- Be like if a bus hit her.
- Dad, she was one step

257
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,947
- off the curb.
- I...

258
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,447
- I saw it!
- Hughie, look. Look.

259
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,488
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

260
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,135
- Dad, I have...
- You don't have the fight.

261
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,159
You never have.

262
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm sorry, but it's-it's true.

263
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,752
Neither do I.

264
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,840
Now...

265
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,682
come and...
come and sit with me, okay?

266
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,179
Remington Steele's on.

267
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,682
Hughie! Where you going?

268
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,283
...the red carpet
outside of Vought headquarters,

269
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,358
here for the annual
shareholders presentation...

270
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,155
There she is.

271
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,868
Welcome to New York.

272
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,988
I'm Ashley Barrett,
director of talent relations.

273
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,656
So, uh, are all these people
here for me?

274
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,075
Oh, honey.

275
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,793
Who else
would they be here for?

276
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,004
Come on.

277
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,554
We're running late.

278
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,837
Oh, my God.

279
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,220
Ladies and gentlemen,

280
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,524
it is without a doubt
a good time

281
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,768
to be in the Superhero business.

282
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,861
Our net income is up 14%.

283
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,978
Our latest film,
G-Men: World War,

284
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,106
just grossed shy

285
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,703
of $1.7 billion world-wide.

286
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,330
And this fall, we break ground

287
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,577
on our newest theme park
outside of Paris.

288
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,039
The branding opportunities
are limitless.

289
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,673
But, you know,
none of that really matters.

290
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:06,421
Because job one is managing,
supporting,

291
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,796
and advising the brave heroes

292
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:14,314
who put themselves in
harm's way each and every day

293
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,889
for us.

294
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,555
Let's take a look.

295
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,486
A world without crime,

296
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,859
with liberty
and justice for all,

297
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,276
that's within our reach,

298
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,575
thanks to the 200-plus
Superheroes

299
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,210
in the Vought Family.

300
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,247
We see a bright future ahead,

301
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,000
where there is a Vought Hero
in every town.

302
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,594
You're doing really well,
by the way, so far.

303
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,721
I-I haven't done anything yet.

304
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,298
Yeah, exactly.
You're already up

305
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,903
two-and-a-half points
with Midwesterners

306
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,968
and conservative Christians
in 18 to 49.

307
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,473
That speech, by the way,
your audition...

308
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,346
It was modest;
it was humble.

309
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,984
Really fucking smart choice.

310
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,071
Uh, I-I meant it.

311
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,527
Yeah, that's why we love you.

312
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,448
So you ready for your life
to change?

313
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,092
...including the jewel

314
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,236
in Vought's crown,

315
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,624
the greatest superhero team

316
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,911
the world's ever seen:

317
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,714
The Seven.

318
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,378
That is our job,
our honor.

319
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,997
We are Vought.

320
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,423
We make heroes super.

321
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,850
I have a very exciting surprise
for you.

322
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,679
Both a member of The Seven,

323
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,685
and Lord of the Seven Seas,

324
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,308
live and in person, the Deep.

325
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,076
Thank you.

326
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,996
Thank you, everybody.

327
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,844
After a long,

328
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,641
distinguished career
with The Seven,

329
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:18,056
my good friend, the Lamplighter,
has retired.

330
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,267
Let's give him
a big "thank you."

331
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,768
What do you say?

332
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,204
Thank you, Lamplighter!

333
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,730
But now,

334
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,694
as we turn towards the future,

335
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:35,446
I'd like to introduce someone
very special.

336
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,330
And I, for one, can't wait
to work with her.

337
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,078
Please welcome Starlight.

338
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,910
Go. Go. That's you.

339
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,861
- Ooh, look at that.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,425
Starlight and the Deep.

341
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,649
Oh. Hi.

342
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,397
I love you, Starlight!

343
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,150
We love you!

344
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,990
Hey, buddy, you okay?

345
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,874
Hey, buddy!

346
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,886
Wow.

347
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,388
Pretty cool, huh?

348
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,720
Oh, hey, check this out.

349
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,805
We have two
World View-4 satellites

350
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,810
in geocentric orbit.

351
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,152
We can essentially read
a getaway car's license plate

352
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,068
from 380 miles up.

353
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,476
That is just...

354
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,105
I mean...

355
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,032
G... I was working with
a police scanner

356
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,861
that I bought on eBay.

357
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,406
Yeah, well,
not anymore you're not.

358
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,290
Oh, and wait till you
check out the dining room.

359
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,908
We, uh, may or may not
have stolen Miro

360
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,956
from Gramercy Tavern.

361
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,919
Yeah, he's
fan-fucking-tastic.

362
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,210
That's his, isn't it?

363
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,875
Homelander's? Yeah.

364
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,925
But you'll have your own soon.

365
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,389
Here. Come on.

366
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,718
Give it a test drive.

367
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,683
Come on.

368
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,814
O-Oh, you-you okay?

369
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,231
It's just...

370
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:17,356
I used to stand in the mirror,

371
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:21,532
pretending to be
where I am right now.

372
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,032
You know something?

373
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,575
On my first day, I, uh...

374
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,210
Well, I-I felt like a fraud.

375
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:35,669
Yeah. But the good news is,
everybody feels that way.

376
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,844
Thank you.

377
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,354
And, hey, we're a team now.

378
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,718
We'll help each other out.

379
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,135
I bet growing up you had

380
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,733
a poster of Homelander
on your wall, huh?

381
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,609
No, actually, I...

382
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,438
I don't know, Homelander's so...

383
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,494
He's like Jesus or something.

384
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,990
If you want to know the truth,

385
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,833
I actually had a poster of you.

386
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,949
Really?

387
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,166
- Yeah. Yeah. I kind of...
- Oh.

388
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,786
I kind of had
a schoolgirl crush on you.

389
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,205
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

390
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,764
I hope that's not
inappropriate to say.

391
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,568
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not inappropriate at all.

392
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:25,392
It's just, it's kind of wild.

393
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,810
What?

394
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,290
I mean, you said you had
a crush on me.

395
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,774
I figured that, you know...

396
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,685
- That is...
- Whoa, whoa, wh-wh-whoa, hey.

397
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,284
Look, you're gorgeous.

398
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,109
I'm not... I'm not talking
about sex,

399
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,074
just a little bit
of pole-smoking.

400
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,967
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

401
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,121
It's just a question of how bad
you want to be in The Seven.

402
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,088
Excuse me?

403
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,340
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

404
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,551
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

405
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,721
Take it easy.

406
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,101
Settle down. We're just,
we're just talking.

407
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,098
And look, I know
that you're powerful.

408
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,441
I get it.
Your powers are no joke.

409
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,938
The thing is...

410
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,360
I am number two around here.

411
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,399
So, like, if I say so,

412
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,073
you know, you'd be out of here.

413
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,162
Especially since
you attacked me.

414
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,158
I what?

415
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,620
Yeah. Look.

416
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:35,751
I mean, Iowa's sweetheart,
the Defender of Des Moines,

417
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,380
just went psycho on the Deep.

418
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,087
I mean, that...

419
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,839
that could put you
out of the business.

420
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,380
Yeah.

421
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,724
I mean, home to Mommy,
tail tucked between your legs.

422
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,561
Just think of all those kids.

423
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,556
I mean, the kids.

424
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,768
Those kids who look up to you,

425
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,519
they'd just be shattered.

426
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,154
I mean, th-that's not
what you really want, right?

427
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,362
Or we come together as a team.

428
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:10,034
You and me, we just roll
with the punches,

429
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,044
for, like, three minutes, maybe.

430
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,037
It's not a big deal.

431
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,329
And then you know what happens?

432
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,754
All your dreams come true.

433
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,879
I-I'm sure you guys
have all heard

434
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,184
that Translucent stopped
a home invasion

435
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,738
in Yonkers last night,
a young, single mother

436
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,323
and her two kids.

437
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,807
Just incredible. Just...

438
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,770
So tell us, how are you able
to-to vanish?

439
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,271
No, I don't actually vanish.

440
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:44,533
My skin turns into this
carbon meta-material

441
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,527
that bends the light.

442
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,278
Like an invisibility cloak.

443
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,910
All right,
but just to be clear,

444
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,946
you have to be
completely naked, right?

445
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,539
I appreciate you coming on
the show, my man. I love you.

446
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,658
You guys stay tuned for
a behind-the-scenes look

447
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,995
at Invisible Force 2, and
later, Translucent himself...

448
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,459
You interested in a nanny cam?

449
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,064
'Cause we're actually running
a special on that.

450
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,418
Um, it's a pretty popular bear.

451
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,005
There's cameras in the eyes.

452
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,510
Tell me,

453
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,141
how many nannies shake
their babies?

454
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,559
Uh, I'm sorry?

455
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:19,768
You know, a good...
hard shake, like...

456
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,020
like tryin' to get ketchup
out of a bottle.

457
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,484
One percent? Less?

458
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,494
I-I don't really know.

459
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,356
Funny, that.

460
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:33,073
They sell a billion dollars
worth of that shit worldwide.

461
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,325
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

462
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,828
The bollocks people
will believe

463
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,830
if you get them scared enough.

464
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,712
Cool.

465
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,670
Cool, cool.

466
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,250
Um...

467
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,705
Is there anything I can
help you with today, or...?

468
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,506
I'm not gonna piss you about,
Hughie.

469
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,930
I heard what happened to Robin.

470
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,072
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
who are you?

471
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,426
She wasn't in the street.

472
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,312
She was one step off
the fucking curb.

473
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,519
And you didn't take the pay-off.

474
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,828
Yeah. I said,
who the hell are you?

475
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:02,902
How do you know that?

476
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,647
Name's Butcher.

477
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,319
Billy Butcher.

478
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,653
Listen, I was thinking that, uh,

479
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:13,574
you and me should have
a little bit of a chat.

480
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,079
Y-You're a Fed?

481
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,908
You don't sound like a Fed.

482
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,753
What, I can't immigrate?

483
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,266
There's a giant green slapper
with her ass in the harbor

484
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,750
that says different.

485
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,977
You don't really look
like one, either.

486
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,841
No? What do I look like?

487
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,127
Like you're starring in
a porn version of The Matrix.

488
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,222
Well, it's all right there
in black and white.

489
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,048
Okay. Uh, what exactly
can I do for you?

490
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,854
No, you got it all wrong,
Hughie.

491
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,757
It's what I can do for you.

492
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,676
You see, you ain't alone, son.

493
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,935
It happens a lot more
than you think.

494
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,227
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

495
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,362
No. Come on, that'd be
all over the news.

496
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,029
People would be screaming
bloody murder.

497
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,545
Yeah, look, there might be
the odd mention

498
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,069
of it now and again,
like with Robin,

499
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,673
but there's a fuck-sight more
that happens

500
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,867
that just gets swept
right under the rug.

501
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,327
Why?

502
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,213
Ain't it obvious?

503
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,917
Movie tickets, merchandising,

504
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,418
theme parks, video games.

505
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,171
A multi-billion dollar
global industry supported

506
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,173
by corporate lobbyists

507
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,965
and politicians on both sides.

508
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,140
But the main reason
that you won't hear about it

509
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,310
is 'cause the public don't
want to know about it.

510
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,060
See, people love that cozy
feeling that Supes give them.

511
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,613
Some golden cunt

512
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,186
to swoop out of the sky
and save the day

513
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,782
so you don't got
to do it yourself.

514
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,858
But if you knew half the shit
they get up to...

515
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,525
Ooh...

516
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,624
Fuckin' diabolical.

517
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,789
But then...
that's where I come in.

518
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,670
Come in to... to do what?

519
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:51,208
Spank the bastards
when they get out of line.

520
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,513
How do you spank a Supe?

521
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,547
Come on, son.

522
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,641
Uh, where?

523
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,046
You'll love it.

524
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,255
Uh, not likely.

525
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,434
Uh, listen.

526
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,932
I think this is good; I'm good.

527
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,944
Uh, thank you for
an extremely weird conversation,

528
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,687
but, uh, I don't want to go
to a second location with you.

529
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,020
So, I'm gonna get back
to work.

530
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,476
Thank you.

531
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:17,656
Hughie! Hughie.

532
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,987
This is your one and only, mate.

533
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,084
Once I go, I'm gone.

534
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:28,041
I'm offering you the opportunity

535
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:31,002
to get them that got your girl.

536
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,713
What have you got to lose

537
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,295
that you ain't already lost?

538
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,445
Where are we?

539
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,779
Keep your mouth shut.

540
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,695
Harry.

541
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,294
Got your message.

542
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,789
Thank you for being
an upstanding citizen.

543
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,792
You know this is fucking
police brutality, man.

544
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,924
You know what they'll do to me,
they catch me letting you in?

545
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,842
Not half of what I'll do
if you don't.

546
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,545
Did he just say
you were police?

547
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,516
Yeah, you know, cop, Fed,
all the same to twats like that.

548
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,355
Holy shit.

549
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,244
Pick your jaw up off the floor

550
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,911
and try to blend in.

551
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,739
This is the only place

552
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,214
where the Supes can scratch
their filthy little itch

553
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,496
without the paps taking snaps.

554
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,881
Wait, wait, wait.
That's Ezekiel.

555
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,427
The "Capes for Christ" guy...

556
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,799
preaches all that...

557
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,635
"pray the gay away" shit.

558
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,891
And now he's
the meat in the Manwich.

559
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,774
Fucking hypocrite.

560
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,776
Keep going forward.

561
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,450
That's it. Further.

562
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,620
Further.

563
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,868
There. There.

564
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,829
- Stop.
- Wait, wait, wait.

565
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,159
A-Train's...
A-Train's here right now?

566
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,495
Was. This is from last night.

567
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,171
Turn it up.

568
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,798
I cannot believe
you ran through a bitch.

569
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,417
You want to hear
something crazy?

570
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,295
I ran so fast
through this bitch

571
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,553
that I swallowed
one of her molars.

572
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,845
Like a bug
on the fucking freeway.

573
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,230
Dude, that's nasty.

574
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:57,522
They're laughing.

575
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,815
Just... Like she's a joke.

576
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,111
They're fucking laughing.

577
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,581
So what are you
gonna do about it?

578
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,202
Oh, for Chrissakes.

579
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,786
Clean yourself up.

580
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,422
Never let them see you
like this.

581
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,255
Translucent,

582
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,297
you're a goddamn pervert.

583
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,256
Ah...

584
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,603
Oh, uh...

585
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,771
I'll just go.

586
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,806
They're all like that?

587
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,315
All of them?
Even Homelander?

588
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,744
Homelander's the exception.

589
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,778
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

590
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,911
Man's a saint.

591
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,618
But the rest of 'em, yeah.

592
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:34,039
Pardon my French,
fuck those fuckers.

593
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,618
Here.

594
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:38,043
Have a shufti of that.

595
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,042
- What are these?
- That's the police log

596
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,544
the day that Robin got murdered.

597
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,836
Couple of bar fights.
A few cars got nicked.

598
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,341
But you know
what's not in there?

599
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,104
No bank alarms going off.

600
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,386
No one charged
at Central Booking.

601
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,720
A-Train stopped
two bank robbers, my arse.

602
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,096
Someone's fucking
hiding something.

603
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,233
- Hiding what?
- Well, I don't know,

604
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,110
whatever dodgy shit
he was up to that night.

605
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,478
Why couldn't he stop?
I mean, what was in that bag?

606
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,526
You know?
Who was he running from?

607
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,109
- Or where was he running to?
- Bingo.

608
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,905
Work that out, and we'll have
the fucker, I can smell it.

609
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,791
Okay.

610
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,497
Okay, so, um...

611
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,580
what can I do to help?

612
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,915
Here's what you do.

613
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,921
Ring Vought, tell 'em you'll
take the money, sign the NDA,

614
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,014
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

615
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,390
Why does A-Train need
to be there?

616
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,696
Then they'll take you
into The Seven Tower,

617
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,930
through security, mate,

618
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,931
- and then you're gonna plant a bug.
- A bug?

619
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,143
A bug. And we'll have
a little listen.

620
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,393
See what's really going on.

621
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:43,056
Okay, let me just... sorry,
let me just get this straight.

622
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:46,565
You want me to... you want me
to go to Seven Tower by myself,

623
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,898
and-and you want me
to plant a bug,

624
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,534
like I'm... what,
like I'm fuckin' James Bond?

625
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:54,162
- Yeah, exactly. You got it.
- You're FBI.

626
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,869
If you're FBI,
then get a warrant.

627
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,179
- Why do you... why do you even need me?
- Hughie, Hughie,

628
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,663
look, mate,
I got a warrant, all right?

629
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,376
But that place is firewalled,
untappable,

630
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,137
and locked up tighter
than a nun's knickers.

631
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,299
I couldn't get myself in there
in a million years.

632
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,957
But you, son, you could do it.

633
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,756
- No, no, I can't, okay?
- Yeah.

634
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,889
I can't. No. You didn't see
A-Train covered in...

635
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,096
And-and I'm, what, I'm
just supposed to go in there,

636
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,467
and I'm supposed to...
I'm supposed to shake his hand?

637
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,524
- And smile?
- Yeah.

638
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,938
I'm not... Do you know
who my favorite musician is?

639
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,727
- Who?
- James Taylor.

640
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,691
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

641
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,362
Any of those guys,
they don't infiltrate.

642
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,701
Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.

643
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,157
Hughie, Hughie,
fucking grow a pair.

644
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,674
You heard that cunt
laughing at your girl.

645
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,328
No. No. No.

646
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,616
No, I can't.
I can't do that.

647
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,790
I'm sorry,
I'm just gonna fuck it up,

648
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,789
and you're not
gonna have your bug...

649
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,831
...and I'll be dead.

650
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,381
I'm not... I'm not like you.

651
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,507
This is amazing, Madelyn.

652
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,813
Thank you for this.
My kid is gonna lose his mind.

653
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,927
Ah, it is our pleasure.

654
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,894
Just do not sell it online.

655
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,646
All right.
What are you thinking?

656
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,358
Baltimore is a beautiful town.

657
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,108
But you've got a problem.

658
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:15,071
Your homicide rates
are up, what, 62%?

659
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,823
The police
are not closing cases.

660
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,718
You're on the verge
of needing a federal lifeline.

661
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,542
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

662
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,367
Who are you proposing?

663
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,002
Nubian Prince.

664
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,960
Fits your population's demo,

665
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,790
but not too militant.

666
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,956
Caucasians love him,
too, with a...

667
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,094
59% approval rate.

668
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,341
I am willing to give you
a three-year exclusive contract

669
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,386
with full PR support,

670
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,059
and I'm gonna give you
nine and a half points

671
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,179
of the merchandising.

672
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,056
I thought he was in Detroit.

673
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,153
Well, we're thinking
about making a move.

674
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,978
How much?

675
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,533
$300 million a year.

676
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,660
I know, I know,
it's a tough swallow.

677
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,409
But we both know that
your city needs a hero.

678
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,543
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

679
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,962
- I can sell that.
- Mm.

680
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,551
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

681
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,087
We've got Atlanta waiting
in the wings.

682
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,681
I think maybe you can.

683
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,337
And why is that?

684
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,811
I happen to know
about Compound V.

685
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,732
What is Compound V?

686
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,650
It's the type of rumor

687
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,899
that could really tarnish
those heroes of yours.

688
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,531
Nobody wants that.

689
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,238
People need heroes.

690
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:39,068
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumor,

691
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,074
because I'm a friend.

692
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,366
But friendship
does cut both ways.

693
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,291
I'm sorry, Steve, I don't know
what you're talking about.

694
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:51,212
$300 million is the price,

695
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,841
or we go to Atlanta.

696
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,587
So, how amazing is it?

697
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,183
What's Homelander like?

698
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,087
Uh... he's busy.

699
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,556
I haven't really
met him yet, but...

700
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,515
Mom, I got to tell you
what happened.

701
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,349
Oh, I forgot.

702
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,274
I was playing mah-jongg
with Patty and Trish,

703
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,523
and Patty is going on and on
about how her daughter

704
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,225
got into med school,
and I'm thinking, so what?

705
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,196
My daughter got into The Seven!

706
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,906
Anyway, so-so,
what did you want to tell me?

707
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,122
Everything's great.

708
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,211
Just how we dreamed.

709
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,706
Um...

710
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,328
Mom, actually, you know what?
I have to go.

711
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:34,286
All right. Bye, honey.

712
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,105
Um...

713
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,650
excuse me.

714
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,704
I'm sorry, a-are you okay?

715
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,527
Just seemed like a...

716
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,702
tough call.

717
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,541
Sorry.
I don't mean to bother you.

718
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,946
No, no, it's okay.

719
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,155
Uh...

720
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,754
I'm fine.
I'm just...

721
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,210
I'm just having a bad day.

722
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,131
Yeah, me, too.

723
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,170
Uh... is it, like,
a-a work thing, or...

724
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,045
a-a life thing?

725
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,053
It's a work thing.

726
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,852
You?

727
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,980
Uh... life thing.

728
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,396
You know how you have this...

729
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,862
image of yourself?

730
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,613
Like, I thought I was strong.

731
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,616
You know?
Like, made of steel.

732
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,948
A fighter.

733
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,413
And...

734
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,123
then I was faced
with this horrible situation

735
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,424
with this asshole...

736
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:57,208
and...

737
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:01,382
I just heard my mom's voice
in my head,

738
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,303
"Keep smiling,

739
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,931
the show must go on,"

740
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,139
and... I didn't fight.

741
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,481
And now I just feel sick.

742
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,517
Partly because I did it, but...

743
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,562
mostly because...

744
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:24,244
...turns out I'm
not who I thought I was.

745
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,158
- Oh. Oh, I'm, um, sorry.
- Uh...

746
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:34,003
I-I didn't mean
to just dump all of that

747
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,829
- onto you.
- No, no, it's totally fine that you dumped. Um...

748
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,378
Listen, d-do you like your job?

749
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,933
Oh.

750
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,466
It's the only thing
I've ever wanted.

751
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:49,221
And it's a good job?

752
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:52,142
Like, you're not
selling kids smack?

753
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,562
No, it's a great job.

754
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,311
I could help a lot of people.

755
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:00,154
Thing is, I, um...

756
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,110
used to know this girl,

757
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,321
and we used to go skating
at Rockefeller,

758
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,243
and I'd be on the side

759
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,241
with this death grip
on the rails.

760
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,793
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

761
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,169
And she wasn't... good.

762
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,247
Like, she fell...

763
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,632
a lot...

764
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,130
but she was never scared.

765
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,471
And she always used to say:

766
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,102
"Just 'cause you fall
on your ass doesn't mean

767
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,060
you have to stay there."

768
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,401
So you fell on your ass,
you know?

769
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,856
That's not who you are.

770
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,784
So who are you?

771
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,914
I'm a fighter.

772
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,622
I'm gonna fight.

773
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,464
Yeah.

774
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,789
I'm gonna take
that son of a bitch's head

775
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:06,336
- clean off his body.
- Okay. Wow, that was...

776
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,051
Okay.

777
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,051
Cool.

778
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,393
Little scary, but...

779
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,428
but-but cool.

780
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,555
I'm-I'm Hughie, by the way.

781
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,391
Annie.

782
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,198
Okay, man. I'm in.

783
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,082
Okay, it's ringing.

784
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:46,632
Yeah, hello?

785
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,961
Hi. Hi.

786
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,006
Yes, hello.
Hello, Mr. Friedman.

787
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,010
It's Hughie Campbell.
I got your message,

788
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:53,852
and-and $45K, it's just...

789
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,017
it's just... it's bingo,
like, life-changing.

790
00:41:57,057 --> 00:42:00,977
Um, but I just need one thing
before I-I sign anything.

791
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,519
I need an apology

792
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,862
- from A-Train.
- Uh, he already apologized.

793
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,818
Well, no, no, no.

794
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,438
No, he hasn't.
Yes, he sent his...

795
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:11,525
he sent his regrets
and his sympathies on...

796
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,871
on TV, but I-I...

797
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:17,537
if I could just get
an apology face-to-face,

798
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,197
that would be fantastic.

799
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:20,706
Just to... just for closure,

800
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,997
just to put...
just to put a b-button on it.

801
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,961
Okay, yeah. But, uh...

802
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,961
Hugh, I'm telling you,
the answer's gonna be no.

803
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,763
All right, in that...
in that case, can you

804
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,337
just give me... Uh, hello?

805
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,092
I think... They hung up.

806
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,053
I don't think
they're gonna go for it.

807
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:37,314
Hmm. Oh, yes, they will.

808
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,409
Starlight.

809
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:59,449
Don't want to be late
to your first official meeting.

810
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,285
I had a whole
welcome speech planned.

811
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,791
Sorry, sir.

812
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,583
Please, Homelander's fine.

813
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,916
Beginning to wonder
if you'd even show up.

814
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,592
I mean, all that pressure,

815
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,430
it's a lot
for anyone to swallow.

816
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,796
Yeah. Don't worry, I'll be fine.

817
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,304
I'm here,

818
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:20,465
and I'm not going anywhere.

819
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,246
Can we get back to this, please?

820
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:29,150
This is a serious crime.
These assholes pirated my movie

821
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,480
three weeks before release,

822
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,485
and you can't walk down
5th Avenue

823
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,277
without bumping into a table
of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

824
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:37,662
Copyright infringement
is costing Vought

825
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,369
$1.2 billion per year.

826
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,119
That's money out of our pockets.

827
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,001
We've all got, what,
four points each?

828
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,658
What the fuck?

829
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,206
You got four points?

830
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,340
And clearly better lawyers.

831
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,007
Hey, hey, hey, guys, come on.

832
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,627
Stop.

833
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,513
What's Starlight gonna think?

834
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,510
Listening to us haggling
over nickels.

835
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,603
We're The Seven, for God's sake.

836
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,679
Whether we're out there
or we're in here.

837
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,346
Now, what I do want to hear

838
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,105
is who you saved this week.

839
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,518
Huh?

840
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,776
Who's up for that?

841
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,152
Black Noir.

842
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:18,952
Let's start with you, man.

843
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:26,827
Do you have a dog?

844
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,253
No.

845
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,421
All right, give us your phone.

846
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,170
There's fuck-all security
to worry about.

847
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,172
In fact,
they're a bunch of muppets.

848
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:36,224
And the metal detector
won't pick this up.

849
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,677
Right? And what
they'll probably do is take you

850
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,178
through the security
and then up into the boardroom.

851
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,811
Sit down. Be nice, congenial.

852
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:47,138
Then, real polite-like, tell 'em
you're gonna take a fake shit.

853
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,265
Go into the bog,
take the bug out.

854
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,522
Peel back the plastic bit
to reveal the sticky side.

855
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,654
Put the plastic bit in the bog.
Flush it.

856
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,072
Then go back into the boardroom,

857
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,992
sit down... big smiles...

858
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,990
plant the bug
underneath the table.

859
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,832
Easy peasy Japanesey.

860
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,077
Bob's your uncle. That's that.

861
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,580
- That's that? That was... that was a lot.
- Yeah.

862
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,934
Th... I've... Hold on, can you
just... can you repeat it again?

863
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,185
Just a little bit slower?
Because I...

864
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,039
Shh. Listen.

865
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,666
- Fuck.
- Hughie, calm down, all right?

866
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,343
This is like that scene
in The Matrix.

867
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,973
Now, you could take
the fucking red pill, right?

868
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:24,061
Spend the rest of your life
jacking off,

869
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,807
crying into your chai tea

870
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,190
green latte,
what the fuck. Or...

871
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,937
you could take the blue pill.

872
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,690
Or is it the red pill?
Anyway, take the other pill

873
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,919
- and quit being a cunt.
- Which pill do you want me to take?

874
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,863
Just quit being a cunt.
That's what I'm saying.

875
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,574
Fuck me. Okay.

876
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,124
Sir, could you empty
your pockets, please?

877
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,150
Thank you.

878
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:27,596
Um...

879
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:29,847
excuse me, can-can I, uh...

880
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:32,099
can I use your bathroom?

881
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,600
Just to be clear,
A-Train's apology

882
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,355
isn't an admission of any sort
of culpability whatsoever.

883
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:39,398
Do you understand?

884
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,214
I'm sorry about what
happened to your girlfriend,

885
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,238
all right?

886
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,198
Hey, dude, are you okay?

887
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,304
Fine.

888
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:10,311
I appreciate the apology.

889
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,636
Accidents happen, right?

890
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,312
After all,

891
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,230
I mean,
you were saving the world.

892
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,649
Okay, great.
Thank you so much. As you know,

893
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,416
a crimefighter's work is never
done. Douglas here will handle

894
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,860
the rest of the paperwork
for you, okay? Thank you.

895
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,118
Can I use your bathroom?

896
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,336
What the fuck?

897
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,185
And I look him right in the eye,
and I smile.

898
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,355
And that was awesome, man,

899
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,244
just getting to stare
that asshole down.

900
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,120
I get why you dig this job.

901
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,367
Yeah, you know, it has
its moments, doesn't it?

902
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,370
You were right.
Fuck A-Train.

903
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:01,963
Fuck A-Train.
Fuck-fuck The Seven.

904
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,799
Fuck all... Seven.

905
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,707
What are we, uh...

906
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,715
what are we doing here?

907
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,717
Well, you got to go
to work, don't you?

908
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,060
Yeah, but, um,
I don't, uh...

909
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:20,517
Well, I mean, that's all
I need you for right now, yeah?

910
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,189
Yeah, I mean, but I-I can...

911
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,979
I can help with other stuff,
you know?

912
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,667
I could... I could be,
like, your tech guy.

913
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,191
You know? Like, I could be
in the van with the thing

914
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,130
and, like, you know, "He's down
the hall to the left."

915
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,204
Like, I can...

916
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,868
Yeah, look, son, I, uh...

917
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,616
I think it's best
that I take it from here.

918
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,458
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, but I-I can...

919
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,043
I can really help.

920
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:42,038
I know you can help.
I got it.

921
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,803
Oh, w...
Oh, hey, wait.

922
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:01,477
You ever see an asshole
tear up $45K?

923
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,555
Hughie.

924
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,187
You're a good lad.

925
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:29,092
Ms. Stillwell,
I wasn't sure you'd call.

926
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,128
This fucking chafes, but, um...

927
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:36,223
I'm willing to come down to
$230 million for Nubian Prince.

928
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,010
That's very reasonable, Maddie.
Thank you.

929
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:42,484
And, Steve,
this, um, Compound V,

930
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,977
any rumors you may have heard
about my heroes...

931
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,189
libelous and completely untrue.

932
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:50,021
But we all know
how rumors spread,

933
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:53,276
so... I'd appreciate
your discretion.

934
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:54,609
Of course.

935
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:55,784
You have my word.

936
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,872
Thank you.

937
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,117
Have a safe flight home.

938
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,834
Policing cities is
a thorny enough issue as it is,

939
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,583
but allowing superheroes
into national defense?

940
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,496
We'd basically be
privatizing war.

941
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,840
Good night, Hughie.

942
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,512
You'll lock up?

943
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:17,841
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

944
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,045
Thanks, Gary.

945
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:33,282
Sorry, we're closing up.

946
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,906
Hello?

947
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,119
Who are you?

948
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,583
The fuck?

949
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,003
Right in front of you, prick.

950
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,088
You think I wouldn't find
this thing?

951
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,220
Hughie.

952
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,387
You pussy, I followed you
from the fucking Tower.

953
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:09,895
No, no, no!

954
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,187
Who's that guy you were with,
in the car?

955
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:16,614
- Who was he?!
- I don't...

956
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:17,963
- He put you up to this?
- I don't know!

957
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,447
He was just some Uber driver,
okay?

958
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,908
Don't give me some bullshit!
Uber driver!

959
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,619
Do you think
I'm a fucking idiot?

960
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,790
- Why'd you plant the bug?
- Please.

961
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,040
Please, please, please.

962
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,371
No, please.

963
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,996
We're The Seven,

964
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,963
Earth's most mighty,

965
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,883
champions of the innocent,

966
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,553
motherfucker!

967
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,887
Sorry about the mess.

968
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:53,015
You should fuck off, Hughie.

969
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,776
Hughie, run!

970
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,122
Well, well, well,

971
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,948
if it ain't the invisible cunt.

972
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,444
There you are.

973
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,006
So who are you?

974
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,845
Fucking spy?

975
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,441
For who? Huh?

976
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,267
You're gonna fucking tell me,

977
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,113
or I'm gonna smash
your fucking scalp off!

978
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,940
Who the fuck are you?!

979
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,985
I'll tell you who you are.

980
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:25,489
A fucking moron.

981
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:29,451
"Translucent"
doesn't even mean "invisible."

982
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,253
It means "semi-transparent."

983
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,315
Is he... is he dead?

984
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,316
Is he...

985
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:04,487
Well, he ain't moving.

986
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,818
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.

987
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,784
How'd you know the electric
could do the job?

988
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,624
Skin's carbon.

989
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,449
Highly conductive.

990
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,535
Saw it on, uh, Jimmy Fallon.

991
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,338
Would've taken me forever
to work that one out.

992
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,707
Good job.

993
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:23,054
Let's get him in the boot.

994
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,299
Wait, wait, what?
Wait, what? What?

995
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,341
The trunk.

996
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,653
No, no, I mean, what are we...
what are we...

997
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,217
what are we doing with him?

998
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,682
Well, Hughie, you just offed
one of The Seven, mate.

999
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,103
Me? I...

1000
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,981
You-you hit him
with a fucking car!

1001
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,359
Look, potato, fucking po-tah-to.

1002
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,146
We're both in a shitload
of trouble.

1003
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,780
No, no, no, we're not!
It's... It...

1004
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:45,277
He-he attacked us, okay?

1005
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,739
And you're-you're
a federal officer, you know?

1006
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,410
Just-just call the fucking FBI.

1007
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,239
Yeah, o-okay, so, look,

1008
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,084
technically, I'm not a Fed.

1009
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,580
What?!

1010
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,665
Then who the fuck are you?!

1011
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,559
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
It's just a little turbulence.

1012
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,018
It'll be okay.

1013
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,329
Whoa.

1014
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,618
Dad. Dad. Dad!

1015
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,417
What's he doing out here?

1016
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,250
Are you guys friends?

1017
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,472
Oh, my God.
