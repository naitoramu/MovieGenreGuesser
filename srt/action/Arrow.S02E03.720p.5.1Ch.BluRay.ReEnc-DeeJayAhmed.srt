1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,970
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,090
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,846
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,088
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,762
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,803
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,080
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,084
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,204
Where the hell did you come from?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,606
What do you think you're doing,
Officer Lance?

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,684
This is my daughter.
She was nearly killed tonight.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,282
As a parent, you're welcome to stay.
But as a beat cop, you're free to go.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,649
- Let me help you.
- Okay. You can help me.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,606
To do what I do, I need intel.
You can be my eyes and ears in the Glades.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,481
- That's how you can save the city.
- How do I contact you?

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,086
Leave that in the alley wall,
and I'll know to contact you.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,329
- I told you to stay away from me.
- The copycats are still alive.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,045
Tommy Merlyn isn't.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,371
I lost a friend that day too, and I would
gladly have given my life for his.

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,326
Well, don't worry, your life is over.
Your life as a free man.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,001
Put your weapon down.

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,606
I'm not your enemy.

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,210
Then put your weapon down.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,169
Nice mask.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,561
Why'd you help me?

26
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,886
Oh, thank God.

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,980
Police scanners have been
blowing up for the past hour.

28
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,904
Laurel called in half the
force with that silent alarm.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,481
Yeah, because going after
actual bad guys is so last year.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,170
To her, I am the bad guy.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,967
- Since when?
- Since I didn't make it to Tommy in time.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,965
How did you get out of there?

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,408
I had help from a masked blond woman
in black.

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,564
- Another copycat vigilante?
- No. She was different.

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,048
Trained, and she used a sonic thing.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,184
Sonic thing? Could you
be a bit more specific?

37
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,149
She turned it on and
the glass shattered.

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,602
- Ok, who was she and why would she help?
- And how did she know to help you?

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,366
Good questions. I don't like the
idea of another player in town.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,681
I'll see what I can find.

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,446
Oliver, I'd like to know what you were doing
at Laurel's office in the first place.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,082
She makes you public enemy number one.
And you figure this is a good time to chat?

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,441
Because I thought that I could
talk to her and make her

44
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,665
understand that I'm doing
things differently this time.

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,370
That I'm not the bad guy.

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,289
I was wrong.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,761
Wonderful.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,884
Now we have a dead Japanese soldier
in our home.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,278
Those men on the island were
looking for these corpses.

50
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:26,029
Aren't you the least
bit interested in why?

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm more interested in how many there are
of them and where they're operating from.

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,285
They'll be coming for that.
Which means they'll be coming for us.

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,563
And as we've already seen,
they're not the friendliest bunch.

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,810
So it kind of looks
like you've done that before.

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,091
Back in Xinjiang, I was pre-med.

56
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,845
She's a woman of many talents.

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,690
Come on.

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,041
- Come on where?
- To higher ground.

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,205
We need to get to a vantage point where
we can establish the enemy's position.

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,522
What about Shado?

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,529
I'll be fine here.

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,450
We shouldn't split up.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,883
Let her play with her corpse.
We'll be back before she knows it.

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,487
- Here you go, bud.
- On the house, Officer Lance.

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,126
Hey, no, no, no, here you go.
A dog this delicious?

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,488
I'd have to book myself for robbery.
Take it.

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,529
- All right.
- Take care.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,331
All units, 10-78 at Second and Fletcher.

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,681
Please respond.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,010
Lance, patrol. Delta Charlie 52, 10-60.
Officer responding. Over.

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,563
Negative, DC-52.
Disregard 10-78 and resume patrol.

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,286
According to whose orders?

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,369
Lieutenant Pike.

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,443
Excuse me.

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,202
What is going on here, huh? This is my
beat. Why did Pike wave me off of this?

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,967
- Quentin, it's under control.
- Excuse me, what is under control?

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,323
Barton Mathis.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,523
That seems to be what the M.O. indicates.

79
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,246
He's doing consecutive life sentences
in Iron Heights.

80
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,521
Not anymore.

81
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,810
The quake split open a section of Iron
Heights. Mathis was among the escapees.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,004
The brass wanna avoid a panic,
so they're keeping it quiet.

83
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,413
They're keeping it
quiet from me too?

84
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,353
Come on man. Pike knows what
happened to you last time.

85
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,517
The man got in your head.

86
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,031
Yeah and I caught him. And
no one knows Mathis better.

87
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,328
And I've got all your notes and your files.

88
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,045
Pike's order.

89
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,961
If you go anywhere near this, he's gonna
have you arrested for obstruction.

90
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,080
I've found a number of police reports
from the last few months...

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,640
that may involve our mystery girl.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,521
They describe a masked woman in black
attacking attackers.

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,790
She put five would-be
rapists in the hospital.

94
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:01,827
You sure it's her?

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,287
Broken limbs, ruptured eardrums.
Your sonic thing.

96
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,885
That's her.

97
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,566
- She's targeting criminals.
- Misogynist criminals.

98
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,560
First the Hoods, now her.
Looks like you've started a movement.

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,722
I don't wanna start a movement.
So we catch her.

100
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,008
I'm not letting this city get overrun
with vigilantes.

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,204
Hi, detective.

102
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,525
So...

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,564
Miss Smoak gives you a way
to call me now.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,041
She vouches for you.

105
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:46,188
And you told me you're trying to help
this city without dropping bodies.

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,285
That true?

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,562
What do you think?

108
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,170
Let's just say I'm willing to be convinced.

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,041
This city is hurting.

110
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,488
And the police...

111
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,401
I always thought we didn't need
to go outside the law to find justice.

112
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,246
But in light of recent events...

113
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,761
I'm not so sure anymore.

114
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,244
Barton Mathis.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,603
The media calls him the Dollmaker.

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,564
Because he suffocates his victims
with a flexible polymer...

117
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,446
that he pours down their throats,
and then he dresses them up like dolls.

118
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,051
I put him away.

119
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,481
Because of the quake...

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,087
he's out and he's killing again.

121
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,123
These are from six years ago.

122
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,163
It's my personal file.

123
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,011
Well, maybe it's not just the file
that's personal.

124
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,081
Mathis killed eight girls
before I got him last time.

125
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,208
I don't want any more on my conscience.

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,320
So why don't you
let the police do their job?

127
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,250
I could say the same thing to you.

128
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,988
They're spread so thin,
they can't even risk

129
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:06,465
letting the public know
that Mathis is out.

130
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,041
You said you're trying another way?

131
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,169
Maybe I am too.

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,569
You have such beautiful skin.

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,584
Lance's file give you anything?

134
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,234
Last time the Dollmaker was
active in Starling City...

135
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,488
he ramped up to one
kill every three days.

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,643
That gives us two to catch him.

137
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,081
Can we connect the victims?

138
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,523
Young. Pretty.

139
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,490
According to Lance's file,
he couldn't figure out how he chose them.

140
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,491
As if porcelain dolls
weren't creepy enough all on their own.

141
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,251
Mathis doesn't have any family
or known acquaintances.

142
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,046
Lone wolves are harder to catch.

143
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,011
But they do have the right to an attorney.

144
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,124
Call Lance.
Tell him to set up a meeting for tonight.

145
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,102
Where?

146
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:30,473
At the office of whoever
represented Barton Mathis.

147
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,211
So I'm assuming this takes
priority over finding

148
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:35,386
out the identity of
your secret admirer.

149
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,527
I got that covered.

150
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,567
Hey. I was wondering
when I was gonna see you again.

151
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,366
There's someone new in town. A woman.

152
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,211
She's targeting men who target women.

153
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,125
I know. I've seen her.

154
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,882
Find her but don't engage.

155
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,009
Leave that to me.

156
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,169
The archer makes quite a mess.

157
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,203
I'll add that charge to the indictment.

158
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,085
Well, you called it right. He showed.

159
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,011
I know him pretty well.
At least, better than others.

160
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,602
This place is a mess. Twice in three
weeks, you're ducking bullets.

161
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,446
- I'm fine.
- You don't look fine. You look tired.

162
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,081
Think I'll give you two a moment.

163
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,081
Did you just come here
to tell me how tired I look?

164
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,571
No, I came here to check up on you
and check up on some court records.

165
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,321
Barton Mathis is out.
I'm looking for his attorney.

166
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,682
Why? You're no longer a detective.

167
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,850
Yeah, well, I'm just doing a little digging
off-the-books.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,082
Dad, this case...

169
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,447
it took you to such a
dark place last time.

170
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,451
Yeah, well, I think we both know
that it wasn't Mathis who did that.

171
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,328
Look, nobody knows this
guy better than me.

172
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:58,788
Which means nobody's got a better
chance of stopping him, ok?

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,725
And that means that every girl that he kills
is like another one on my conscience.

174
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,365
No.

175
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,005
No, Dad, it's not.

176
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,488
Whatever guilt you're feeling...

177
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,921
you're just using it
to justify a vendetta.

178
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,885
Well, maybe I'm not the only one.

179
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,726
Are you okay?

180
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,049
Thea, you have to stop asking me that
every time you come to visit.

181
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,287
Don't count on it.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,280
Well, then, I'm afraid you'll be asking it
for the next 25 years to life.

183
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,891
Please don't talk like that.

184
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,089
Thea, there's not a lot of value
in the power of positive thinking...

185
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,925
when you're being put on trial
for mass murder.

186
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,081
Let's just try to take things
one step at a time, okay?

187
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,163
Well, I'd have to check with my lawyer...

188
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,290
but I don't think retail therapy
is a viable legal strategy.

189
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,330
Well, I spoke with her.

190
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,962
And she said that you could wear
regular clothes to your pre-trial hearing.

191
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,168
So I picked these.

192
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,731
Hm.

193
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,446
I wish the fashion police
was all I had to worry about.

194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,688
- Please don't joke.
- Thea.

195
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,442
Listen to me. I need you to understand
what's happening here.

196
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,645
Five hundred and three people are dead and
there is a measure of guilt that is owed me.

197
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,121
I'm ready to accept my punishment.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,403
Even if that means
spending the rest of your life in here?

199
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,205
Yes.

200
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,769
Tony Daniel?

201
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,245
- Help you with something, officer?
- Barton Mathis.

202
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,346
According to the DA's office, you
handled his post-trial appeals.

203
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:54,867
And I'd like to
know where he is.

204
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,123
So you can give him a parking ticket
or something?

205
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,407
You wanna talk to me
about one of my clients...

206
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,602
come back with a detective's shield...

207
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,730
or a court order.

208
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,768
- What, you find that funny?
- Well, a little bit.

209
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,364
Where do we find him?

210
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,127
- Iron Heights Prison.
- He got out.

211
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,328
He what? How?

212
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,285
You spent hours with him.
Where would he run?

213
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,241
- Where?
- I don't know. I swear.

214
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,285
- Agh!
- What are you doing?

215
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,044
I thought you were done killing people.

216
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,280
- He'll live.
- But he'll report me to my lieutenant.

217
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,124
He won't talk to anyone.

218
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,164
- What makes you so sure?
- Because he has another shoulder.

219
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,526
Agh!

220
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,011
Okay, okay, okay.

221
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,290
No, there's... There is another place.

222
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,008
He was always drawing it. Sketching.
His cell walls were covered with the place.

223
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,090
Well, what's the place?
Was it in Starling City?

224
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,166
The Bisque Museum.

225
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,482
He said the building reminded him
of Germany.

226
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,842
Where porcelain dolls were invented.

227
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,843
I'm sorry. I guess he just gets
enthusiastic sometimes.

228
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,769
The lady at the desk said that a guy
matching Mathis' description...

229
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,249
checked in last week.
Room 52. And he paid in cash.

230
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,250
Listen. Just so we're clear,
when we go through that door...

231
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,593
We're here to arrest
Mathis, not to torture him.

232
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:35,826
You asked for my help.

233
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,931
That wasn't easy and neither was aiding
and abetting. I am still a police officer.

234
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,851
Do you want to catch him or not?

235
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,444
Let's go.

236
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,049
Detective.

237
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,810
It's been too long.

238
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,527
- Felicity, I need a trace.
- On it.

239
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,004
You sick son of a bitch.

240
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,806
Sick? I've never felt better.

241
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,240
Fresh air agrees with me.

242
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,164
Yeah, well, don't get too used to it.

243
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,967
I caught you before. It's just a
matter of time before I do it again.

244
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,164
Fair enough. In the meantime, however...

245
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,721
I have someone
who'd like to say hello to you.

246
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,001
Say hello, dear.

247
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,202
She's a little inarticulate.

248
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,640
She's done nothing to you.

249
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,167
Please don't hurt her. Just let her go.

250
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,081
And allow her to wither away
in a mediocre and forgettable life?

251
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,161
No. No, no, no.
She deserves so much better.

252
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,649
She deserves to see her beauty preserved.

253
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,809
Pristine.

254
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,847
Forever.

255
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,682
Don't worry.
I will turn her into something special.

256
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,928
Now, pay attention, detective.

257
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,442
What comes next is really quite exquisite.

258
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,282
The sound of an esophagus
slowly hardening.

259
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,529
Like a symphony.

260
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,203
- Felicity
- I'm trying, but he's blocking the trace.

261
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,767
Don't do it. I'm begging you.
Is that what you want?

262
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,644
I am begging you. Please, just stop.

263
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,160
It's for the world to enjoy.

264
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,241
After all...

265
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,525
everyone loves a pretty doll.

266
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,369
The police found her body an hour ago.

267
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,881
Does the new victim give us
any forensics we can use?

268
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,130
CSI did a complete forensics work-up, but
they sent everything out to a private lab.

269
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,611
Can you get in?

270
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,764
No. They took their system offline.

271
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,288
Seems like someone hacked into
a lot of police-related systems last year.

272
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,486
Then we do it like we did the Merlyn job.

273
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,170
So glad you invited me to tag along.

274
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,802
Tranq dart. He'll be out for 36 minutes.

275
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,486
Yeah, I remember.

276
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,281
You're up, Felicity.

277
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,166
So this is what a typical night's like for
you. Just a little breaking and entering.

278
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,567
All right. I got toxicology first.

279
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,007
What are all these?

280
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,037
Chemical ingredients of all the
makeup found on the victims.

281
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:03,712
Skin cream, nail
polish, lipstick.

282
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,528
Wait, wait, wait, stop.
Scroll back. Scroll back.

283
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,242
This one. "Ethylparaben.
Sodium laureth sulfate."

284
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,766
I've seen this before.

285
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,290
It's skin cream. Forensics found
traces of it on her fingers.

286
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,767
Probably something she used
before he grabbed her.

287
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,004
Skin cream. Mermaid something.
One of the victims

288
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,909
from his last run, she
had this in her purse.

289
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,602
I had the lab analyze it. It's the same...
You know, it's the same formula.

290
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,450
- Felicity.
- Already on it.

291
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,930
How the hell could she do that?

292
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,044
Ethylparaben and sodium laureth sulfate
is Mermaiden's proprietary formula.

293
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,921
Two victims with the same taste in skin
cream. That can't be a coincidence.

294
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,044
I could never figure out
how he chose his victims.

295
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,281
I think you just did.

296
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,371
We shouldn't have left Shado.

297
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,130
Well, it's her life.

298
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,885
It's her choice.

299
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,441
- You listened to my advice.
- What advice?

300
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,883
- To avoid attachment.
- Yeah, that was bad advice.

301
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,320
Well, it'll save your life.

302
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,453
Maybe I don't wanna
live under those terms.

303
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:10,225
Yeah, well, maybe
you're an idiot.

304
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,085
Hey, you think that caring about
people gets you killed.

305
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,242
I think it's what keeps people alive.

306
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,242
I was wrong about you.

307
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,084
You're definitely an idiot.

308
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,841
Then that's who I am.

309
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,209
- I'm not changing.
- Agh!

310
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,400
You should be happy
I haven't avoided attachment to you.

311
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,610
Harper.

312
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,524
It's been a while, hoss.

313
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,051
I been busy.

314
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,765
I can see that.

315
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,771
I'll give you a hundred.

316
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,968
- Four.
- Two-five.

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,081
Done.

318
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,362
If you throw in some information.

319
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,965
Ugh.

320
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,648
Come on, man. You've got your finger on
the pulse. I'm looking for someone.

321
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,643
A blond. Likes black leather.

322
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Sounds like your type.

323
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:12,306
And beats the crap out
of guys with a Bō staff.

324
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,443
That still sounds like your type.

325
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,041
Look, I wanna put eyes on her.
What do you know?

326
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,571
Not much.

327
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,604
You know Cindy? Folks call her, uh, Sin?

328
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,451
She got short, spikey hair.

329
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,416
She's been seen a
couple of times hanging

330
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,515
around with your, uh,
black-leather girlfriend.

331
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,085
So where can I find Sin?

332
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,443
She hangs out over at Fifth and Boynton.

333
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,450
And that is what I know.

334
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,444
So this is it?

335
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,849
- Skin cream? That's our lead?
- It's something.

336
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,482
- What do we know about the product?
- It's made from crushed mother of pearl.

337
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,570
That's super high-end.
Only carried in a handful of boutiques.

338
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,764
And it's marketed for women
with extremely delicate complexions.

339
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,766
He picks his victims for their skin.
The cream is how he finds them.

340
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,804
Only four stores in the city carry it.
Three have surveillance systems.

341
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,885
I've ran facial recognition through all of
them looking for Mathis but come up empty.

342
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,273
He must be staking out the
stores from the outside.

343
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:11,671
Fine, so we'll do the same.

344
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,222
That could take
days we don't have.

345
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:15,567
He's probably out there right
now looking for another girl.

346
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,011
So that's what we give him.

347
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,560
I'll go to the stores that carry Mermaiden,
and buy it in each one to cover our bases.

348
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,130
It's too dangerous.

349
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,882
More dangerous than going undercover
in a mob casino or jumping out of a plane?

350
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,482
It's my life. It's my choice.

351
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,008
There are only two ways onto this island.

352
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,170
By sea and by air.

353
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,408
So what, you're gonna steal whatever
they use to get onto the island?

354
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,082
Well, I'm tired of living here. Aren't you?

355
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,131
Oh, my God.

356
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,248
Appears to be two or three klicks offshore.

357
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,690
What the hell?

358
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,164
It's firing on a fixed location.

359
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,243
- The plane. They must have found it.
- Shado.

360
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,167
Kid!

361
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,728
That's the last store.
You're gonna reimburse me for these, right?

362
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,729
I saved my receipts.

363
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,921
Go to the rendezvous point.

364
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,889
Stay in public.

365
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,807
Just for the record, I'm
not a huge fan of dangling

366
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:42,146
helpless girls in front
of psychopaths like meat.

367
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,930
She volunteered.

368
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,805
Well, she must really believe in you.

369
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,530
So did your daughter.

370
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,962
She suffered a loss.

371
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,243
Grief's got a way
of shifting a person's beliefs.

372
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,283
But then, you know all about that.

373
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,050
You've lost people too, right?

374
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,485
- Why would you say that?
- Why else would you be doing this?

375
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,729
My youngest, she died.

376
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,481
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,644
Less than a month after it happened, I...

378
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,724
I ended up catching the Dollmaker case.

379
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,008
I threw myself into it.

380
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,167
I think, on some level,
with each girl, I was trying to save...

381
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,163
Sara.

382
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,606
And just like with Sara, I couldn't.

383
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,002
He killed eight girls Sara's age
before I caught him.

384
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,129
Someone's coming.

385
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,647
I got him.

386
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,689
Okay, I'm going to admit
to being seriously wigged out right now.

387
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,726
False alarm, but next time I offer to be bait
for a serial killer, please turn me down.

388
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,364
Delta Charlie 52 to Central.

389
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,361
Code 99. Possible 207 in progress.

390
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,001
Immediate back-up required.

391
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,881
You all right?

392
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,849
Don't move.

393
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,724
- She hit her head.
- Go, go, go!

394
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,520
I thought there'd be more ceremony
to this moment.

395
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,284
I'm a little disappointed, to be honest.

396
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,725
Get out of here.

397
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,490
It's Lance. S.C.P.D.

398
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,009
- it's Mathis. I almost had him.
- Search the area. The whole building.

399
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,764
- Sorry.
- For what?

400
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,924
Pike's orders.
He wants you collared for obstruction.

401
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,525
What are...? What...?

402
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,764
Quentin Larry Lance,
you have the right to remain silent.

403
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,605
If you give up that right to remain silent,
anything you say can...

404
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,762
They're charging Lance with obstruction.

405
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,121
He's in custody.

406
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,607
Mathis isn't.
He'll be looking for another target.

407
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,481
I hacked Mermaiden and sent out
an e-mail blast from their servers...

408
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,602
telling stores the
product was defective.

409
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,291
- That'll slow him down.
- Smart.

410
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,649
- What about Lance?
- One legal problem at a time.

411
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,648
Docket ending 4587. State vs. Queen.

412
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,123
All right. I'll hear motions. Ladies first.

413
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,484
Your Honor, we would like to be heard
once again on the issue of bail.

414
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,564
Ms. Queen has languished in the
Iron Heights Prison now for five months.

415
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,963
And in those five months, did the 503
people she's charged with killing...

416
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,242
miraculously return from the dead?

417
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,121
If not, I'm a little unclear on how
the passage of time is relevant.

418
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,489
Might I remind the court,
the defendant is presumed innocent?

419
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,486
No need. I went to law school. It's where
I learned that bail, once denied...

420
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,167
cannot be set in the absence
of change of circumstance.

421
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,442
Mr. Donner, what do you have for me?

422
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,486
Your Honor, the State has no pre-trial
motions to make at this time.

423
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,811
But we would like to serve notice
to the defense...

424
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,770
pursuant to Rule of
Criminal Procedure 15.

425
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,651
Your honor, I would like to conference
with the District Attorney.

426
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,924
There's really no need
nor any obligation.

427
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:37,789
What about
professional courtesy?

428
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,089
I would like to have a conversation with
you before you seek the death penalty.

429
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,087
Your client aided and abetted
an act of mass murder.

430
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,288
Five hundred and three conversations...

431
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,207
wouldn't convince me that Moira Queen
shouldn't be the 504th fatality.

432
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,601
Your Honor...
- Mom, we are gonna fight this.

433
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,525
Don't worry.
No one is gonna take you from us.

434
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,848
We won't let it happen.

435
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,529
Oliver!

436
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,047
Oliver! Unh!

437
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,211
Shado! Agh!

438
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,762
I had to call in a lot
of favors to get those.

439
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,691
The only problem is that I've been
at the DA's office for less than a month...

440
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,565
and no one owes me any favors.

441
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,404
So how'd you get the charges dropped?

442
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,622
Your friend Pike and I
have been working together

443
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:13,709
on the anti-vigilante task
force, do you remember?

444
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,561
Last year you were working with the Arrow.
What a difference a few months makes.

445
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,431
The Arrow?

446
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:20,588
Yeah, seems more
appropriate than "the Hood."

447
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,609
And now you're working with him.

448
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,644
I guess I'm not the only one in the
Lance family that's done a 180.

449
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,283
This city needs help. I just became
less particular about where it comes from.

450
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,644
What's your excuse?

451
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,926
Still Tommy?

452
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,442
What would you tell me if I said it is?

453
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,705
That a guy with a bow
and arrow can't save a

454
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,834
guy who's had a building
fall on top of him.

455
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,924
What's going on with you
is not about the Arrow.

456
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,808
Then what is it, Dad?

457
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,526
Hm? I mean, why don't you tell me?

458
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,290
You seem to have all the answers.

459
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,649
That crack that you made
about me feeling guilty about something.

460
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,330
Tommy's death.

461
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,330
Why would I feel guilty about that?

462
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,689
I don't know,
I wish I did because it's eating you up.

463
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,801
Your psychoanalysis would probably
have a bit more credibility...

464
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,765
if it wasn't being offered
under police custody.

465
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,684
I'm worried about you...

466
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,003
I'd stay away from Pike if I were you,
and the Dollmaker case.

467
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,687
Excuse me.

468
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,206
Step off, Abercrombie.

469
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,847
Cindy?

470
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,362
- Sin?
- What do you want?

471
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,210
Can't you see I'm busy?

472
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,809
I'm looking for a friend of yours.

473
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,287
Blond, black leather head to toe?

474
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,965
So I guess that's a yes.

475
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,521
Bright lights.
Christmas lights. Christmas lights.

476
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,883
He said he would go inside
and replace them with Christmas lights.

477
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,771
That's what he said.
He said he would go inside and...

478
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,724
You all right, pal?

479
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,165
You need a doctor or something?

480
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,884
No. I'm fine, thanks.

481
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,884
Laurel...

482
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,327
I checked the order, and you shorted
us half a case of champagne.

483
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,803
I'm not paying for booze I didn't get.

484
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,291
- Can we get a count on that?
- I've got four cases...

485
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,010
That won't help.

486
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,969
Yeah, well, neither is yelling at my vendors.
But I wanna yell at someone right now.

487
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,083
Mom's gonna be okay.

488
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,760
Because we are gonna help her fight this.

489
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,325
As a family.

490
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,170
They wanna kill her.

491
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,691
I won't let them.

492
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,930
Thea, can you turn to channel 52, please?

493
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,209
Officer Quentin Lance and his daughter,
Laurel, were abducted earlier today.

494
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,328
No ransom has been demanded.

495
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,320
S.C.P.D. are urging anyone with
information regarding their whereabouts...

496
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,048
- How'd he get them?
- Don't know about Laurel.

497
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,368
Detective Lance was abducted
from the precinct parking lot.

498
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,880
Mathis shot a guard on the way out,
which sounded the alarm.

499
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,106
I pulled up the department
security camera footage,

500
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:40,194
and a van from Metamorpho
Chemical caught my eye.

501
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,482
Metamorpho was condemned
after the quake.

502
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,648
- Perfect place to make some dolls.
- Not tonight.

503
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,401
- Cops can trace this, same as we did.
- They won't make it in time.

504
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,486
Hey.

505
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,408
- Wake up, Abercrombie.
- What?

506
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,280
Did they send you?

507
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,926
Did who...? What? What? Unh.

508
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,888
Agh! Not my face.

509
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,808
I have a disapproving girlfriend.

510
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,490
Are you one of them?

511
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,404
One of who?

512
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,450
That's mine.

513
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,809
Let him go.

514
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,930
Isn't this nice?

515
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,451
All of us here together.

516
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,682
It's like Thanksgiving.

517
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,321
Laurel, stay calm. Stay calm.

518
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,045
Barton, I'm sorry.

519
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,369
I know you hate me. I know you hate
me, okay? And I understand that.

520
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,761
But you hate me.
So please let my daughter go.

521
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,044
Now, why would I do that?

522
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,647
Look at her. She's so lovely.

523
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,967
Maybe a little too much
melanin in the skin...

524
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,921
but it's the imperfections
that make art sublime.

525
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,164
I am the one that put you away.
She had nothing to do with it!

526
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,402
She had everything to do with it!

527
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,602
She's your world. She's your very soul.

528
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,731
You know, I could kill you, I could maim
you, slice you up into a thousand pieces...

529
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,123
but if your soul remains intact,
what have I wrought?

530
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,327
Huh?

531
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,322
- Nothing.
- I will kill you, you son of a bitch!

532
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,768
I will kill you! You son of a bitch!

533
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,411
Laurel. Sweetheart.

534
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,806
Close your eyes.

535
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,527
I'm here.

536
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,481
I'm here, honey.

537
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,684
If you struggle, it will take longer.

538
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,806
Do whatever you need to do.
Just get him. Get him!

539
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,882
Let's take a better look
at this face of yours.

540
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,050
You have such lovely skin.

541
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,368
You're going back to prison.

542
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,886
No. He's not.

543
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,685
It's okay, sweetheart.

544
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,928
It's okay. He saved us.

545
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,010
I know.

546
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,162
I know he did. And after I hunted him...

547
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,530
- it's okay. It's all right.
- No. He came...

548
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,284
He came to save me.

549
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,689
- Yeah, I know. He saved us both.
- No.

550
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,050
Not him.

551
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,284
Not the Arrow.

552
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,680
Tommy.

553
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,565
- What?
- Oliver...

554
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,566
he told me to stay out of the Glades,
and he...

555
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,205
You told me to get out of CNRI,
and I didn't.

556
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,563
Tommy was only there
because I was too stubborn.

557
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,121
Too stubborn to get out
when I had the chance.

558
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,361
You were right.

559
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,123
I was blaming the Arrow because...

560
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,805
Oh, my God.

561
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,642
It's all my fault, Dad.

562
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,769
It's all my fault that Tommy died.

563
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,607
It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right.

564
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,841
How is she?

565
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,964
She'll be all right.

566
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,770
In time.

567
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,481
I might not always agree with your methods,
but I can't argue with your results.

568
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,049
You saved my daughter.

569
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,201
Again.

570
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,849
She needed help.

571
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,881
And she wasn't the only one.

572
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,326
Thanks.

573
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,524
Moira.

574
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,321
I know how hard this
day has been for you.

575
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:22,905
Yes.

576
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,363
And believe it or not,
I've actually been in worse situations.

577
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,721
Listen to me.

578
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,360
Donner knows how strong our defense is.

579
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,723
Don't let him scare you with that
little death-penalty stunt of his.

580
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,167
I'm not afraid of dying, Jean.

581
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,364
I've made my peace with this world
a long time ago.

582
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,562
Then let's win the case in the courtroom.

583
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,088
The trial is gonna reveal that you were
living under Malcolm Merlyn's thumb.

584
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,208
- It's gonna reveal everything.
- Yes.

585
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,483
And that's what I'm afraid of.

586
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,646
Moira, what don't I know?

587
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,923
Don't you do this. You need to tell me.

588
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,600
I am your lawyer, and I
am also your friend.

589
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,922
Thea and Oliver.

590
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,566
I'm finally in a good place
with my children, Jean.

591
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,610
I have my family back.

592
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,765
But there are some things...

593
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,769
that must never be spoken of.

594
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,770
You shouldn't have come here.

595
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,491
I had no choice.

596
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,968
Ra's Al Ghul has ordered your return.

597
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,931
I'm not going back. I can't.

598
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,881
That is not your decision.

599
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,322
Tell them that you couldn't find me.

600
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,289
Tell them I ran.

601
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,248
I won't lie for you.

602
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,810
Fine.

603
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,162
Don't tell them anything.

604
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,080
Something's going on with this woman. She
keeps following you around, helping you out.

605
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,065
We've gotta find her.

606
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,148
To stop her or to send
her a thank-you note?

607
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,647
- That depends.
- On what?

608
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,287
What side she's on.
