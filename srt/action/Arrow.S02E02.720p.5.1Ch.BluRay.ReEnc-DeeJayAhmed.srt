1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,766
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,248
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,442
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,088
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,722
But to do so, I can't be the killer
I once was.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,723
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,920
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,600
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,321
It's a Hozen.
In Buddhism it symbolizes reconnecting.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,364
And now that Malcolm's dead,
there's only one archer left.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,442
And I'm gonna help my boss catch him.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,607
Let the kid go.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,689
It's like you have a death wish.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,360
And guess what. It's going to come true.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,929
Yeah, well, someone has to do something
and stand up for what's right like he did.

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,929
- Faster.
- Foot's on the floor, man.

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,927
Call it in.

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,449
This is FEMA Truck 52.
We're being pursued by two armed bikers.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,849
We're heading south on Third Street.
Requesting immediate assistance.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,364
Get us out of here.

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,244
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,886
Who the hell was that?

23
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,047
Just so you know,
the real bad guys are getting away.

24
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,766
- We're gonna need more sparring dummies.
- I'll start ordering them in bulk.

25
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,883
This mean you're ready
to launch Crusade 2.0?

26
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:50,955
I'm ready. I just don't
know where to begin.

27
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,285
Last year I had the list.

28
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,189
Getting justice was as simple as
crossing names out of a book.

29
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,461
This is Starling City.

30
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,549
You never have to look far to find
someone engaged in illegal activity.

31
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,963
- Yesterday Big Belly Burger got robbed.
- Was Carly there? Is she okay?

32
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,723
Yeah, she was, um...

33
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,445
It was her day off.

34
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,476
Good, well the three of
us should get dinner.

35
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,945
I haven't seen her
since I got back.

36
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,755
Why the sudden interest
in my love life?

37
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,904
If it's important to
you, it's important to me.

38
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,809
Hey. I didn't see you come in.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,924
I had a secret entrance installed
when I ran the club.

40
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,561
Kidding.

41
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,684
Hello?

42
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,044
Yes. Yeah, this is Thea Queen.

43
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,081
Of course that's where he is.

44
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,801
- Who is he, Roy?
- I already told you, I don't know.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,482
So you just happened
to have one of his arrows.

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,408
- I hear he likes green ones.
- Do you think this is funny?

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,288
Because I can charge you
with obstruction right now.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,650
Look...

49
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,730
I used to feel the same way as you.

50
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,807
He has this way of seducing you...

51
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,565
making you feel
like he's some kind of guardian angel.

52
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,207
But he's not.

53
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,847
He causes chaos and death.

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,602
And you trying to emulate him
just makes the situation worse.

55
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,846
Half the city fell into a hole.
I'd say the situation's already worse.

56
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,187
Some of us are just
trying to make it better.

57
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,705
Who, like you and the Hood?

58
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,325
Look, there...

59
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,008
There are others.

60
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,841
Others out there
who are willing to do what's right.

61
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,883
I've seen them.

62
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,447
I've seen her.

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,890
I'm not interested in anyone else.

64
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,730
Just him.

65
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,526
What happened?

66
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,042
- Are you hurt?
- Fender bender.

67
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,040
- He totaled his car playing Hood Jr.
- At least it wasn't my car.

68
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,608
Don't say anything.
I already called you an attorney.

69
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,087
That won't be necessary.
We're not pressing charges.

70
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,498
So long as he gives
up looking for trouble.

71
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,992
Might as well tell him
to give up breathing.

72
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,889
I'll talk to him.

73
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,088
Ask him if he knows anything
about the vigilante.

74
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,206
Roy's obviously forged
some sort of connection to him.

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,800
Maybe it goes both ways.

76
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,681
Doesn't sound like the vigilante'd
have a groupie.

77
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,211
That's just it.

78
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,847
We don't know anything
about the vigilante...

79
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,323
except for every time he shows up,
all hell breaks loose.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,650
It has to stop, Ollie.

81
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,088
He has to be stopped.

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,086
Thea, can you ask Mr. Diggle
to bring the car around, please?

83
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,688
I'll always think of you fondly.

84
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,523
Save the speeches.

85
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,361
Your ex-girlfriend already laid one on me.
Still no effect.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,924
- I used to be a lot like you, Roy.
- I doubt that.

87
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,687
I spend more time
in the back of cop cars than limos, so...

88
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,287
The world doesn't work anymore.

89
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,361
It broke a long time ago, but it was like
you were the only one who noticed.

90
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,687
That makes you angry.

91
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,203
And you're afraid that that anger
is gonna burn you up inside...

92
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,958
if you have to live in the
world one second longer

93
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,192
knowing that you could
do something to fix it.

94
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,682
That anger's gonna put you
in the hospital, kid.

95
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,769
Or worse.

96
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,686
Well, I'll take worse.

97
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,407
Better to be dead
than in a hospital these days.

98
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,769
- What do you mean?
- Been to the Glades Memorial lately?

99
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,611
No, but I didn't read
that it was damaged by the quake.

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,040
It wasn't.

101
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,687
The medicine that FEMA's been sending
the hospital is being hijacked.

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,127
So, if they don't resupply,
they'll be forced to close.

103
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,130
- By who?
- I don't know.

104
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,164
The doctors and nurses are already bailing
on the place. And the cops?

105
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,729
The cops rarely venture that deep into the
Glades, so I guess that leaves only me.

106
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,922
What's it take to make you angry?

107
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,687
Oliver! No!

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,249
Others will come.
They won't be happy we killed their men.

109
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,728
All the more reason
to figure out why they're here.

110
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,850
It's a map...

111
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,921
of the island chain containing Lian Yu.

112
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,871
This is similar to the
recon shots ASIS gave

113
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:15,708
me before we came here
to rescue your father.

114
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,002
Whatever they're looking for,
it must be here, on this island.

115
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,130
I've seen men in war
with that look in their eyes.

116
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,446
What look?

117
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,291
The one that says he's split
into someone else.

118
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,001
Someone he doesn't even recognize.

119
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,730
If someone doesn't talk to him,
it'll tear him up.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,844
Come on. Let's get away from this place.

121
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,011
People survive the quake and end up here.
From one hell to the next.

122
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,524
Whoever's stealing from here,
they won't be for much longer.

123
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,205
This city is failing on all counts.

124
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,004
Who's that in the spotlight?

125
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,090
Sebastian Blood,
the local alderman that I told you about.

126
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,001
- Not too shy about sharing his opinions.
- Which are?

127
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,328
Which are that the Glades
have been abandoned...

128
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,722
and no one gives a damn
about these people.

129
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,126
He hasn't met us yet.

130
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,842
We cannot stand by while the
doctors on the other side of those doors...

131
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,202
are working with the bare
minimum of resources because

132
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,388
the police department already
sees us as a lost cause.

133
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,283
Meanwhile, thieves are seeking to make
a quick buck off the misery of the Glades.

134
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,091
Oliver Queen, isn't it?

135
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,206
Alderman.

136
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,051
What brings you to Glades Memorial,
Mr. Queen?

137
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,165
I assume someone of your means can afford
the best medical treatment money can buy.

138
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,761
I can assure you
you're not gonna find that here.

139
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,485
That's wrong, sir.

140
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,989
The people of the Glades
have suffered too much

141
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:11,034
not to have access to
basic medical services.

142
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,044
Well, that's very compassionate
of you to say...

143
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,881
although I wonder where your family's
concern for its fellow citizens was...

144
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,051
when they ordered the construction of the
earthquake machine that killed 503 people.

145
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,370
Ladies and gentlemen.

146
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,874
I'm going to do everything
in my power to atone

147
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,067
for my family's culpability
in this tragedy.

148
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,144
Well, I'm sure the people
of the Glades that

149
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,030
I represent will sleep
better knowing that.

150
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,046
If they still had a place to sleep.
If their homes hadn't crumbled around them.

151
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,164
If their stores and their businesses
hadn't been condemned.

152
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,011
- You did this to us.
- Go back to your mansion, rich boy.

153
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,130
Spare us your mercy visits, Queen.
You've done enough for this city already.

154
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,846
Excuse us. Pardon us.

155
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,884
Sir, how do you plan on fixing the...?

156
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,845
- I quit.
- No, you don't.

157
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,127
Yes, I do.

158
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,041
Not my old job in the IT Department but
my new job as your executive assistant...

159
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,201
...which you think
I'm going to accept.

160
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:23,872
Your thinking could not be
more wrong in this matter.

161
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,489
- I need a Girl Wednesday.
- It's "Friday." And the answer is no.

162
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,968
These computers have been upgraded.

163
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,084
Far more processing power
than your typical secretary.

164
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,248
Did you know I went to MIT?

165
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,131
Guess what I majored in.
Hint: Not the secretarial arts.

166
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,566
Felicity.

167
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,248
We all need to have secret identities now.

168
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,889
If I'm going to be Oliver Queen, CEO, then
I can't very well travel down 18 floors...

169
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,169
every time you and I need to discuss
how we spend our nights.

170
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,328
And I love spending the night with you.

171
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,329
Three, two, one.

172
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,162
I worked very hard to get where I am,
and it wasn't so I could fetch you coffee.

173
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,442
Well, it could be worse.

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,970
My secret identity is his black driver.

175
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,125
Right now I need you to figure out
how the hijackers are getting a line...

176
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,802
on the goods earmarked
for Glades Memorial.

177
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,090
If we know how they're
picking their targets...

178
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,029
We'll know when and
where to stop them.

179
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,885
Fine.

180
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,445
Oh.

181
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,165
May I get you a cup of coffee?

182
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,167
You're not actually offering to
get me a cup of coffee, are you?

183
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,206
Yeah, nope. That won't be happening. Ever.

184
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,966
Well, if you can bring yourself to do it,
can you please make reservations...

185
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,289
for Dig, Carly and I
Saturday night at Table Salt?

186
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,405
Sure.

187
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,481
I'll get right on that. Using the Internet.
Which you also happen to have access to.

188
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,045
- You still haven't told him?
- He has enough on his plate.

189
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,011
Last year when Oliver Queen returned
to Starling City...

190
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,123
he was met with flowers and well wishes.

191
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,649
However, today, down at Glades Memorial, he
was met with a far less cordial homecoming.

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,685
The question is no longer
"Where have you been, Oliver Queen?"

193
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,287
Now, it's
"But what have you done for me lately?"

194
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,405
Mr. Queen was not available for comment.

195
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,606
You saved my life.

196
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,604
That's what I keep telling myself.

197
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,921
That I killed that guy
because he was gonna kill you.

198
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,364
What if that's not the reason?

199
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,002
I just feel like this island is...

200
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,171
It's turning me into something terrible.

201
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,242
No island, no place,
can make you something you're not.

202
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,602
So I've always been a killer?

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,480
Everyone has a demon inside of them.

204
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,090
The Dao De Jing recognizes
the yin and the yang...

205
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,403
opposing forces inside all of us.

206
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,168
The darkness and the light.

207
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,683
The killer...

208
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,651
and the hero.

209
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,309
Never thought I'd say
this, but I'm actually

210
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,214
getting more done down in
the basement of an...

211
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,548
abandoned steel factory than in
the corner office of a high-rise.

212
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:17,314
What do you have?

213
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,802
FEMA is shipping 100,000 units of
medical-grade opiates to Glades Memorial.

214
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,962
When?

215
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:24,388
The truck is scheduled to leave
the FEMA depot in 20 minutes.

216
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,762
Not if this motorcycle gang
has anything to say about it.

217
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:27,787
Bad luck for them.

218
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,690
I have something to say about it.

219
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,403
No, please, don't...

220
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,766
Down!

221
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,401
Make your delivery.

222
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,322
The emerald archer.

223
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,126
I feared you had perished in the quake...

224
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,051
denying me the opportunity
to pay you back in full...

225
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,322
for your past
interference in my business.

226
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,410
Your business is going under. Permanently.

227
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,600
I don't think my friend agrees with you.

228
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,206
Our new partnership was easily cemented.

229
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,445
You see, I was eager to see you dead,
and he was eager to kill you.

230
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,486
No kill shots?

231
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,809
I was promised a fight.
I hope you haven't lost your nerve.

232
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
Find out.

233
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,887
Starling City Police. You're surrounded.

234
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,890
Put down your weapons or we will open fire.

235
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,686
Open fire!

236
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,571
Cease fire. Cease fire.

237
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,646
Find him.

238
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,603
He couldn't have gone far.

239
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,687
Does it hurt?

240
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,731
Not as much as some things.

241
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,288
I love that we live in a city where the
police are more interested in catching you...

242
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,881
than the drug-stealing mobsters.

243
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,526
Our tax dollars at work.

244
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,882
The authorities have always
gone after the vigilante.

245
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,451
This time was different.

246
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,846
Why? Because this time
it's Laurel leading the charge?

247
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,526
Because they got in my way.

248
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,250
I can't make things
better as Oliver Queen...

249
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,721
and now I can't make things better
as the vigilante.

250
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,050
- So what if Laurel's involved?
- Hey. Go easy on him.

251
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,920
- It's all right. Felicity.
- No, it's not.

252
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,710
You don't get to jump
down his throat just

253
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,496
because you happen to
be having a lousy week.

254
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,646
Ok, you're pissed he invoked
the all-mighty Laurel.

255
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,504
Well, you're not the only one whose
love life is taking it on the chin.

256
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,201
- Felicity.
- What are you talking about?

257
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,325
I'm talking about: You keep bringing up Carly,
but you're so involved with yourself...

258
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,842
that you don't even realize the
look he gets every time you do.

259
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,886
What is she talking about?

260
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,770
Me and Carly pulling the pin.

261
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,681
It happened when you were gone. Truth is,
it's been happening for a while now.

262
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,491
Being the vigilante's wingman was a strain.

263
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,964
He needs to hear this.

264
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,928
This wasn't just about
what we were doing, Oliver.

265
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,805
This isn't just about you, man.

266
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,762
I couldn't separate what was going on
with me and Carly...

267
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,645
- and what went on with my brother.
- Deadshot.

268
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,808
He's still out there.

269
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,120
My brother's killer is still breathing.

270
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,048
And I guess I, uh, couldn't hate him
and love her at the same time.

271
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,724
See?

272
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,486
You are not the only one having trouble
reconciling two sides of himself.

273
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,007
Great crowd tonight.

274
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,528
Now that we're closed,
you gonna be starting your second shift?

275
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,444
Suicide by Chinese street thugs?

276
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,759
Do you really wanna
talk about this again?

277
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,828
We never finished
talking about it.

278
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,769
I wanted Laurel to arrest you.

279
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,165
You know, you're not the first girlfriend
to say that to me.

280
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,562
She said I couldn't change you,
so I'm not gonna try to.

281
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,645
What, so you're giving me money and a rock?

282
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,127
The check is two weeks' severance
from the club.

283
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,166
Just because I can't change you doesn't
mean I have to let you be in my life...

284
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,885
until you get yourself killed.

285
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,483
And my brother gave me that
when he came back from the dead.

286
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,489
Said it was a Hozen...

287
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,526
some Buddhist thing
that symbolizes reconnecting.

288
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,371
If you wanna reconnect with me...

289
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,202
- keep the Hozen and tear up that check.
- I don't do too well with ultimatums.

290
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,640
And I don't do all that great
with people I love getting hurt.

291
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,245
Or worse.

292
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,806
Your 4:00 is here.

293
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,288
Although I'm not entirely sure why
you would invite him up to your office.

294
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,604
Because I need to fix this situation,
and there are no cameras...

295
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,768
or people to throw things at me in here.

296
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,531
Alderman. Thank you for coming.

297
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,246
Mr. Queen.

298
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,566
This is some view.

299
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,570
How small the rest of us must all look
from up here.

300
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,807
- Ms. Smoak.
- Yes.

301
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,008
Would you get my guest and I some coffee?

302
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,205
You know, I would, Mr. Queen, but it seems
that someone's broken our coffeemaker.

303
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,843
Violently.

304
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,086
I was surprised that you wanted to meet.

305
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,966
As surprised as I was
when you turned a frenzied mob on me?

306
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,802
Oh, that shouldn't have
been too surprising.

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,367
My constituents have a lot of anger
towards your family.

308
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,000
They have a right to.

309
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,808
My mother was involved
in something unspeakable.

310
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,128
But I'm my own man.

311
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,682
- And I'm not your enemy.
- You're not a friend.

312
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,645
To me or the people of the Glades.

313
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,207
I am hoping to prove otherwise.

314
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,811
Mr. Queen, not every problem
can be solved by money.

315
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,841
Real change will never happen
until your elitist friends realize...

316
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,487
that it is morally unacceptable to allow
thousands of its fellow citizens...

317
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,420
to live right down the
street but in a Third World.

318
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,794
Then let's show them.

319
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,521
I'll host a benefit,
invite some of my elitist friends...

320
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,088
and then you and I can help them
see what needs to be done.

321
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,882
People seeing you.

322
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,570
Seeing you stand up, the CEO of Queen
Consolidated taking responsibility...

323
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,003
and being this cause's public face.

324
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,288
That would make a difference.

325
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,566
Then let's make a difference.

326
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,571
Listen...

327
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,282
I am truly sorry for what happened
outside that hospital.

328
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,090
Sometimes my emotions
get the better of me.

329
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,930
Hey, kid! Shado!

330
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,122
Yeah. Just, um...

331
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,131
Slade, just washing off.

332
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,970
Well, you better prepare to get dirty again.
I figured out where those men were headed.

333
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,731
It's a couple of klicks northwest of here.

334
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,724
Well, let's go.

335
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,840
Be careful.

336
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,247
- Don't fall too hard.
- Why not?

337
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,640
To make sure there isn't any part
of this island that doesn't totally suck?

338
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,810
To survive. She's a distraction.

339
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,089
And in a place like this,
a distraction's gonna cloud your judgment.

340
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,851
And that is what's gonna get you killed.

341
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,846
Look at what this island
has already done to you, kid.

342
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,049
Hello, Laurel.

343
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,401
- Seems like old times.
- Figured we should talk.

344
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,286
Fine.

345
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,612
Turn that thing off and
pull back your hood.

346
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:05,029
I'm not your enemy.

347
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,727
- And I thought we understood each other.
- I understand that you're a criminal.

348
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,008
And you think the law doesn't apply to you.
It does.

349
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,441
But you didn't always feel that way.

350
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,725
You used to think that I was
helping the people in this city.

351
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,961
And then I saw you.

352
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,247
I don't understand.

353
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,081
The night of the earthquake,
I saw you at CNRI.

354
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,485
My friend was inside the building
when it collapsed.

355
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,088
He went there to rescue me.

356
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,244
And by the time I managed to climb inside,
he was gone.

357
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,400
But I saw you.

358
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,447
Running away into the night.

359
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,571
You didn't save him.

360
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,122
You were too busy...

361
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,051
fighting a meaningless duel
with Malcolm Merlyn.

362
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,368
And when people...

363
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,605
people you told me you would protect,
needed your help...

364
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,561
you weren't there.

365
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,449
I don't think you wear that hood
because you're a hero.

366
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,040
I think you wear it
to hide that you're a coward.

367
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,923
And I promise you, I will see you unmasked,
prosecuted and sent to prison.

368
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,011
Don't ever speak to me again.

369
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,491
You look like a woman
who's looking for someone.

370
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,006
A friend of mine. He's
throwing this benefit.

371
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,211
Ah. Oliver Queen.
I didn't realize you were friends.

372
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,640
Very old friends.

373
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,249
So you can imagine how I feel
about you putting him in the crosshairs...

374
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,046
of public opinion, alderman.

375
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,290
For what it's worth, I have apologized
to Oliver for my rhetorical excesses.

376
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,565
In fact, it is that détente
which brings us all here tonight.

377
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,965
So where is Oliver?

378
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,970
That's exactly the question
I've been asking myself.

379
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,450
We're late.

380
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,480
Good news is, at least
you get to make a dramatic entrance.

381
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,441
Oh, I'm just lucky Oliver Queen has a
reputation for not showing up on time.

382
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,240
You know I've been meaning to tell you,
it really weirds me out...

383
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,041
to no end the way you refer to yourself
in the third person like that.

384
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,963
It's Felicity.

385
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,411
- Tell me.
- I've got good news and bad news.

386
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,161
I hacked into FEMA's server... Yet another
federal offense, thank you very much.

387
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,284
And was able to find out when the next
shipment of pharmaceuticals is taking place.

388
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,131
- When?
- That's the bad news.

389
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,129
Five minutes ago.

390
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,120
I know this is the definition
of sucky timing...

391
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,411
but which suit are you planning
on wearing tonight?

392
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,561
Doesn't seem Mr. Queen is going to honor us
with his presence this evening.

393
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,283
So where are you going?

394
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,925
To address his guests.

395
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,410
It's time they realized
what kind of a man their host is.

396
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,080
You're just gonna crucify him
in the media again?

397
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,003
Crucifixion has such a bad reputation.

398
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,321
But the Romans used it to punish people
who acted against the public good.

399
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,611
Alderman.

400
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,607
Ladies and gentlemen.

401
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,530
Thank you. Thank you.

402
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,371
But you should hold your applause
for Oliver Queen.

403
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,211
This evening's charity was his brainchild.

404
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,044
As such...

405
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,682
you could be forgiven
for wondering why Mr. Queen...

406
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,769
isn't with us tonight.

407
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,600
And the answer, I'm afraid,
is painfully apparent.

408
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,245
He doesn't care.

409
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,761
I told Mr. Queen...

410
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,050
that this city's problems
cannot be solved with his money.

411
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,403
That he needed to stand up
and be counted as someone who cares.

412
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,365
- So where is he now?
- Lieutenant.

413
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,211
We got a Hood sighting,
headed down Lemire Avenue.

414
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,084
Let's go.

415
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,447
I don't know where Oliver Queen is.

416
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,806
All I know is that he isn't here.

417
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,050
This city is dying.

418
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,490
And it needs someone to stand up
and breathe new hope into it.

419
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,130
And tonight it is painfully obvious
that person is not Oliver Queen.

420
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,131
Go!

421
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,328
I told you. On time to die.

422
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,000
Closing in on the vigilante's position.

423
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,208
This doesn't make any sense.

424
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,448
This is supposed to be live surveillance.

425
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,447
What the hell is this building doing here?
It was destroyed in the quake.

426
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,723
Who in the hell could be feeding us
year-old surveillance?

427
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,524
Health care has enough problems
without you punks.

428
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,410
You're not the only one
allowed to bring a friend.

429
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,006
I'm clear.

430
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,247
That makes one of us.

431
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,324
Go ahead, waste your arrows.

432
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,602
That hurt, but it won't stop me.

433
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,483
That will.

434
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,725
Dig?

435
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,650
Diggle?

436
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,251
You've changed.

437
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,121
You would have killed me by now
if you hadn't.

438
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,891
The police can take the shipment
the rest of the way.

439
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,242
They still won't see you
as anything more than the enemy.

440
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,923
You'll never be anything
but a criminal to them.

441
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,247
Which means you'll never be a hero.

442
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,250
As long as this city is safe...

443
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,487
it doesn't matter.

444
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,687
After a prolonged pursuit,
police have arrested Chien Na Wei...

445
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,491
a high-ranking member
of the local Chinese triad...

446
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,001
which was responsible
for the recent hijackings...

447
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,771
of pharmaceuticals bound
for Glades Memorial.

448
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,566
Representatives praise the efforts
of the S.C.P.D...

449
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,411
in saving the hospital
from shutting down...

450
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,087
though some sources say
the vigilante may have been involved.

451
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,403
In other news, protests continue...

452
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,161
I was just about to make my move
on her.

453
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,443
I didn't need one of your trick arrows
getting in the way.

454
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,603
Couldn't risk it.
Where would I be without my black driver?

455
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,050
Diggle.

456
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,281
I'm sorry about you and Carly.

457
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,041
Yeah, well, couples break up.

458
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,646
Not everything that happens
in Starling City is your responsibility.

459
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,609
I'm learning that.

460
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,650
What I meant was I'm sorry
that I wasn't there for you.

461
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,683
Because I should have been.

462
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,840
I got wrapped up in my own suffering...

463
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,886
and I forgot that some other people
might be suffering too.

464
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,406
You know, we're getting dangerously close
to hug territory, so I'm gonna fall back.

465
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,886
You need a ride?

466
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,691
Turns out that being CEO,
I actually have some work to do.

467
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,769
I'll find my own way.

468
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,087
You always do.

469
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,411
Back in Starling City, Oliver Queen finds
himself in the hot seat once more.

470
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,490
At least in the eyes of city alderman,
Sebastian Blood.

471
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,765
Oliver Queen's failure to show up to his
own benefit shouldn't surprise anyone.

472
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,920
He's no different than the rest of the Starling
City elite who've failed to show up...

473
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,926
when it comes to ending the suffering
of those left devastated in the Glades.

474
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,763
Oliver Queen is not a friend
of the people of this city.

475
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,931
One.

476
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,844
To those men, this location could have been
on any one of 150 different islands.

477
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,609
But for somebody who knows this island
like he knows his own name...

478
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,724
So those men were looking for this place.

479
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,843
- Why?
- That would be the question.

480
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,804
Slade?

481
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,968
Over here.

482
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,969
The skulls are misshapen.

483
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,083
What happened to these people?

484
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,482
Whatever did happen to them
was over 60 years ago.

485
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,162
These soldiers belonged
to the Japanese Imperial Army.

486
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,046
They've been here since World War ll.

487
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,525
We're missing something here.

488
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,167
You don't just come here for corpses.

489
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,445
I've been looking for you.

490
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,803
- You need to stop.
- You saved my life.

491
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,722
Made me realize...

492
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,246
it wasn't much of a life.

493
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,248
That I could do what others couldn't,
were too afraid to do.

494
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,684
I could help you save the city.

495
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,769
- You're untrained.
- I can fight.

496
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,850
You can take a beating.
There's a difference.

497
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,804
Then teach me.

498
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,491
Let me help you.

499
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,690
Okay. You can help me.

500
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,168
But not by taking on the Triad or the cops.

501
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,971
Then how?

502
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,806
To do what I do, I need intel.

503
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,647
You can be my eyes and ears in the Glades.

504
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,084
- That's how you can save the city.
- How do I contact you?

505
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,487
Leave that in the alley wall...

506
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,762
and I'll know to contact you.

507
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,927
You sure it's all right that I keep this?

508
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,564
If I wanna be with you,
do I keep that or give it back?

509
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,966
You were a little unclear.

510
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,161
- You mean it?
- No more fighting.

511
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,207
If it's a choice between life with you
or life without you...

512
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,086
life with you will
win every single time.

513
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,765
I'm done trying to be a hero.

514
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,444
I told you to stay away from me.

515
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,801
I thought
you might have changed your mind...

516
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,201
after I stopped the men
terrorizing our city.

517
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,880
This isn't your city.
It's your killing fields.

518
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,925
- The copycats are still alive.
- Tommy Merlyn isn't.

519
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,930
I lost a friend that day too.

520
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,726
And I would gladly...

521
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,689
have given my life for his.

522
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,287
Well, don't worry. Your life is over.

523
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,047
Your life as a free man.

524
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,361
I told you to stay away.
Somehow I knew you wouldn't listen.
