1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,163
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,586
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,755
I'm recommending he be
transferred to a facility

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,127
that can provide
the care that he needs.

5
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,925
- Where's my dad?
- Have a seat.

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,095
He's gonna be okay,
but I need to tell you about it.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,469
You wanna keep going,
or are you gonna testify?

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,385
We're leaving.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,972
You've seen what having Felicity
in my life has done for me.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,729
You deserve that same
kind of happiness.

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,856
I've located
the Heir of Ra's al Ghul.

12
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,461
- So, where are we going?
- Wherever you want.

13
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,045
It's up to me?

14
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,874
I'm the well-traveled man. I've been
every place in the world there is.

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,335
But you want to get out of here.

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,388
Because if the police know
you're alive, they'll come after you.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,464
The Arrow, too.

18
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:02,135
Yes. If someone knew where I was,

19
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,347
it would be unfortunate
for both of us.

20
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,477
So, why did you reach out to me?

21
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,357
I don't want to hurt, or get hurt.

22
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,527
Never again.

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,027
I can teach you to be strong,
in heart and body.

24
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,201
I can teach you to protect yourself,
so, no one will ever hurt you again.

25
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,199
That's what every father
wants for his daughter.

26
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,884
Malcolm Merlyn's legacy lives on.

27
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,391
This is a new dawn.

28
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,558
Al Sa-Her was going to bestow on us
a new golden age,

29
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,940
and lead us into
the realm of Thanatos.

30
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,281
Yet for what greatness
Merlyn possessed in his soul,

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,111
he lost in his heart.

32
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,372
He swore that our great journey
would be nothing

33
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,666
without his blood legacy at our side.

34
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,411
And thus, before he gave up his life,

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,588
he made sure this journey
could not commence

36
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,836
until his beloved was ready.

37
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,679
Step forward.

38
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:34,190
I have to say,
the new uniforms do not impress me.

39
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,318
We've cleansed ourselves
of your father's sins

40
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,493
for our rebirth, which couldn't be
further from your fate,

41
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,696
daughter of the Demon.

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,534
I would so relish
slitting your throat, Athena.

43
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,955
One thing we have in common.

44
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,880
Except I've grown a taste
for the contemporary.

45
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,879
Such as plastic explosives.

46
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,581
Oh, my gosh!

47
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,338
You'd be in so much trouble
if your dad saw you doing that.

48
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,715
You're lucky
you have such a cool aunt.

49
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,047
You know,
who approves of bad behavior.

50
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,350
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

51
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,928
Just promise me that you're gonna
watch over your dad, okay?

52
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,011
But he is the Green Arrow.

53
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,768
You know,
before he was the Green Arrow,

54
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,850
he actually used to be
really afraid of the dark

55
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,527
and he needed a night light
in his bedroom till he was what, 16?

56
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,197
It was not a night...
It was not a night light.

57
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,321
I couldn't sleep
with it being pitch-black.

58
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,245
By the way, I did see that.
Go get a fork and a plate,

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,287
and get yourself
a reasonable slice of cake.

60
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,327
Yes!

61
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,920
Thank you for doing this.
It's actually pretty cool.

62
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,375
Why do you sound surprised?

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,917
I don't know.
I just thought that maybe,

64
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,469
you'd be a little more anti me going.

65
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,672
I'm the one who encouraged you
to go follow your heart.

66
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:30,181
I know, I know. It's just that,
now, that it's all real, I just...

67
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,388
I thought that maybe, you'd be like
a tad less supportive.

68
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,809
I'm completely supportive

69
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,267
of anything and everything
that makes you happy.

70
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,941
Speaking of which, I did tell Roy
that the two times that I shot him

71
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,523
with arrows would be nothing
compared to what would happen to him

72
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,654
if you end up unhappy.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

73
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,202
- Yeah.
- I spy an overbearing big brother.

74
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,450
Again, no, no,
he's never been like that.

75
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,530
Never?

76
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,834
I know we've said it a million times
but we're gonna miss you,

77
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,162
we're really gonna miss you.

78
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,338
You guys have to come visit us
once we find where we're gonna land.

79
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,881
Where do we think
that's going to be?

80
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,011
We don't really know exactly,
but that's kind of the best part.

81
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,009
I mean, we're gonna figure it out
as we go along.

82
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,637
That's so spontaneous and romantic.

83
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,014
As long as we're together, that's
really all that matters, right?

84
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,847
So, how's your new roommate?

85
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,933
She's just as messy as my Laurel,

86
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,313
but surprisingly,
she's a better cook.

87
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,812
You trust her, Lance?

88
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,694
I'm not stupid, you know. I know
who she is, I know what she's done.

89
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,243
But she says
she's trying to get better,

90
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,494
and, well, that intel
she gave you last week on Diaz,

91
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,790
that panned out.

92
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,369
- Yeah. He still got away.
- Don't they always, though?

93
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,082
I'm sensing
a work conversation, so...

94
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,586
Where are we with the SCPD?

95
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,543
Well, Dinah and Curtis,

96
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,754
they are growing a list of
possible cops on the take,

97
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,555
but that could end up being
the least of our worries.

98
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,475
- How so?
- The DA's office refusal

99
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,473
to drop your case
without Roy's testimony,

100
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,804
that doesn't sit right with me.

101
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,479
And who's to say that the SCPD

102
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,432
is the only part
of the city's power structure

103
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,142
that Diaz has got his fingers in.

104
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,229
Yeah. Oliver,
you let me worry about Diaz.

105
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,813
You spend a little more time
with your sister

106
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,068
before she gets out of here.

107
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,574
And you think this guy's gonna

108
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,367
stop worrying about things
all of a sudden?

109
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,278
Well, ever since
he trusted me to take over.

110
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,538
If that's still on the table.

111
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,783
I'm gonna go, grab some cake.

112
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,751
You brought this up last week.

113
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,207
I don't know, man.

114
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:28,215
I thought we were clear,
you wanted out, I wanted in.

115
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,092
- Has something changed?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,097
Yeah, it's just you and me.

117
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,847
And we don't know
what Diaz has, what he doesn't.

118
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,978
And bottom line, I don't think
that it should be just you.

119
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,566
This is definitely one of the jerks
who beat Roy to a pulp last week.

120
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,152
I wonder what food they're serving
at Thea and Roy's goodbye party.

121
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,613
Pizza, apps,

122
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,249
maybe like some mini-desserts,
that's this new thing.

123
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,167
Like you go to a party
and then they serve you

124
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,290
these desserts like mini-donuts,
and you just dip them in the sauce.

125
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,712
That would be reason enough
to crash a party,

126
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,881
not that I'm saying we crash a party.
I'm not expecting to be invited,

127
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,426
- but Felicity's my business partner...
- Curtis, focus.

128
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,253
We need to find out
how many of these cops are dirty.

129
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,094
- Well, Officer Hester makes ten.
- Yeah, and counting.

130
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,634
The more cops who are dirty,

131
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,685
the harder it is to believe
Captain Hill didn't know.

132
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,845
Who's next?

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,561
Nick Anastas.

134
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,944
More like hot Anastas. Wow.

135
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,354
Just because
you've the hots for him

136
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,155
doesn't mean
he's not on Diaz's payroll.

137
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,607
All his stats check out.

138
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,909
He doesn't have any influxes of cash
into his account,

139
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,361
or pressure points for blackmail.

140
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,788
Look, I'm just saying
you never mentioned to me,

141
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,742
that you worked
with such a hot police officer.

142
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,126
Not even once.

143
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,661
I guess I never noticed.

144
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,293
Yeah, just like you don't notice
beautiful sunsets and rainbows.

145
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,795
You just don't. You see, beauty is...

146
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,169
Hey, Z. How's school?

147
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,846
- Good. Hi, Dinah.
- What's up, Zoe?

148
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,673
Feeling like
some mac and cheese tonight?

149
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,601
- Again?
- Can you get sick of mac and cheese?

150
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,223
Definitely getting there.

151
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,439
- Come on.
- Going to my room to do homework.

152
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,276
You two seem to be
getting along well.

153
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,071
Yeah. It's almost nice, having
a little Munchkin around.

154
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,867
I'm sure Rene appreciates somebody
he trusts taking care of her.

155
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,077
Yeah, you know,
he should be starting rehab soon.

156
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,238
Hopefully, he'll be
back to normal ASAP.

157
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,870
- I really, really miss that guy.
- Me, too.

158
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,452
Hey, it's your boyfriend. Anastas.

159
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,666
Homicide, gotta go.

160
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,965
You keep digging. I got to find out
who at work I can trust.

161
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,917
He's not my boyfriend yet.

162
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,386
I'm on it.

163
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,768
I can't believe
we're actually doing it.

164
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,304
Yeah, I can't believe it, either.

165
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,723
Happily ever after.

166
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,897
Yeah, ever after.

167
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,364
- Okay, that wasn't so convincing.
- Hey, I'm thrilled.

168
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,487
I just... I don't wanna jinx it.

169
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,411
Okay, since when
do you believe in superstitions?

170
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,910
Well, ever since I met your brother,
there's not a lot I don't believe in.

171
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,924
Okay, now, I may believe it, too.

172
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,298
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

173
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,516
Please tell me you've packed
some weapon somewhere.

174
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,597
Follow me! Hurry!

175
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,401
Nyssa, what...

176
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,445
- What is going on?
- We need to move.

177
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,194
- What, are there more coming?
- Many more, these were the scouts.

178
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,025
They look like
the League of Assassins.

179
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,907
No, the League of Assassins
was disbanded, this can't be them.

180
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,364
Nothing stays dead forever.
Your father made sure of that.

181
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,828
Okay, well, I don't care.
I'm sorry, this is not me anymore.

182
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,787
I've nothing to do with this.

183
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,749
Like me, you are
an Heiress to the Demon.

184
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,050
That is something
you can never truly run from.

185
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,349
Hey, what happened?

186
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,807
- Thea, are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine, I'm okay.

187
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,601
I'm doing pretty fine myself,
thanks for asking.

188
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,527
They weren't even out of city limits
and they got attacked.

189
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,402
- It's because she jinxed it.
- Superstition played no part.

190
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,821
I hear you've taken my husband
as your own.

191
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,451
Yeah. Well,
we can talk about that later.

192
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,329
In the League, such talk would take
the form of mortal combat.

193
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,534
What the hell is going on?

194
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,087
Apparently, my dear old dad decided
to recruit some loyalists

195
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,666
- before Nyssa disbanded the League.
- For what?

196
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,503
To start his own. The Thanatos Guild.

197
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,383
Began hearing whispers
about them shortly

198
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,964
after we all returned from Lian Yu.

199
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,048
He couldn't have lived for long

200
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,304
considering he didn't
leave the island.

201
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,182
Moses never entered the Holy Land,
and yet, his legacy endured.

202
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,764
His second-in-command,
Athena, took charge.

203
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,815
A contemporary of mine, and a rival.

204
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,319
Her involvement alone suggests
a very dark purpose at work here.

205
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,364
Why would this Guild attack Thea?

206
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,532
Before Merlyn gave up his life,

207
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,407
he discovered a map that leads
to something ancient. Powerful.

208
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,487
I do not know what it is,

209
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,198
but I do know
that he yearned for Thea

210
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,954
to be at his side
when he unearthed it.

211
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,909
It's really funny
he never mentioned this.

212
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,085
Because he knew you were not ready.

213
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,289
Athena believes Thea to
either be in possession of the map,

214
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,670
or at the very least have knowledge
of its whereabouts.

215
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,545
Well, you have fun
on your treasure hunt, okay?

216
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,839
I told you, you cannot run from this.

217
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,808
Watch me, okay?

218
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,308
Roy and I are getting out of here
and back to our lives.

219
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,888
I need your help obtaining the map.

220
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,146
You cannot deny your father's legacy
any more than I can deny mine.

221
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,606
They will find you.

222
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,982
What do you want from me?

223
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,234
Merlyn had an associate in Star City.

224
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,817
If he shared the map's location with
anyone, it would've been with her.

225
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:43,901
You haven't spoken to her?

226
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,113
She does not care for me.

227
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,078
But she would not deny
Merlyn's daughter.

228
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,168
Okay, fine.
I'll go with you to talk to her,

229
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,878
we'll help you find your map.

230
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,133
And then, that's it.
I'm done for real this time.

231
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,805
Drug deal gone bad.

232
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,357
Very bad. The man was shot
over a dozen times.

233
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,402
Maybe he pissed off the competition.

234
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,403
I'll take it from here,
Lieutenant Drake.

235
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,569
Captain, this is
a drug-related homicide.

236
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,025
Isn't it a little below
your pay grade?

237
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,280
It's part of a larger
sting operation.

238
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,532
I wasn't aware of a larger...

239
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,410
You aren't aware because it's
above your pay grade, Lieutenant.

240
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,747
Well, we'll head back
to the station, then.

241
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,961
Hey. You can leave the evidence
with me.

242
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,380
Of course.

243
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,365
Now, I see why
you didn't want the boys to come.

244
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,988
That is Tigressa.

245
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,245
Looks like the only thing
she knows how to kill is vodka.

246
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,542
She has over 200 confirmed kills.

247
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:19,205
One of them being her own brother
because he matched her quote.

248
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,545
Al Ghul.

249
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,970
I should take your hand
for what you did to Al Sa-Her.

250
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,894
I never understood
your affection for Merlyn, Tigressa.

251
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,604
But I always respected it.

252
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,482
- This is...
- His spawn.

253
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,569
You think I wouldn't recognize
Malcolm's own blood?

254
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,022
Your father had much faith in you.

255
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,984
Yeah, well, but that new league
he created running around,

256
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,488
I can't say the same for him.

257
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,411
So, you've met Athena.

258
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,574
She is not the leader
your father desired. You are.

259
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,750
Yeah. Well, I'm sure death has
cured him of his disappointment.

260
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,377
Look, the only reason
why we are here is because

261
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,631
Athena thinks
I can open some map for her.

262
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,928
And with good reason.

263
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,005
Your father made sure
you were the only one

264
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,307
that could actually
unlock its secrets.

265
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,010
Of course, he did.

266
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,312
And that is why Athena needs you.

267
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:24,820
Your father secretted the map...

268
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,980
Here.

269
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,237
And why didn't you just take it?

270
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:36,748
I rejected the path of the League
of Assassins a long time ago.

271
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,796
One day, you're gonna have to tell me
how you did that. Thank you for this.

272
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,297
When you find it,
you may not be so grateful.

273
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,128
I was being polite.

274
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:52,135
We should contact your brother.
There's safety in numbers.

275
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,429
Overwatch, are you sure
we're alone here?

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,354
Yes, it's just the five of you.
No other souls for two blocks.

277
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,813
Copy.

278
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,606
Be cautious. Merlyn would have
laid traps to protect this place.

279
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,024
What kind of traps
are we talking here?

280
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,531
Are we talking <i>Raiders</i>
or <i>Temple of Doom</i> kind of traps?

281
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,533
- You okay?
- I will be once this is all over.

282
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,613
Yeah, me, too.

283
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,240
Get down!

284
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,045
A trap. Excellent.

285
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,250
- "Excellent"?
- We must be close.

286
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,048
Thermal imaging is showing

287
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,675
that what we're looking at
is what we've got.

288
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,051
No hallways, no doors.

289
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,008
Malcolm had a secret chamber
in his office.

290
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,389
He might have something here.

291
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,303
Clever.

292
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,153
Iodide diazonium.
A component magnetically attracted

293
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,281
to the same type of steel
my father used to encase relics.

294
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,013
Okay. That's not a map.

295
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,013
The map is inside.
It's an ancient League cipher.

296
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,725
- Does it need a code?
- Try my birthday.

297
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,521
Eighteen digits across,
three alphabets.

298
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,395
Okay, so, it's not my birthday.

299
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,395
Tigressa.

300
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,574
Guys, about you being
the only souls for two blocks.

301
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,070
Funny thing about those ninjas.

302
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,454
I want Al Sa-Her's daughter,
and the map.

303
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,874
I'm always merciful
when I get what I want.

304
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,743
I know you better than that.

305
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,080
Stand down. I'm not gonna ask twice.

306
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,926
Come with us,

307
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,429
and we'll let your friends
continue to draw breath.

308
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,353
Stay where you are,
and blood will be shed.

309
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,101
We'll go with shedding blood.

310
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,187
Except, it'll be yours.

311
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,364
Take this someplace safe. Go.

312
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,988
Exit's kind of blocked right now.

313
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,660
We can help with that.

314
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,630
You've had the same footwork
since you were eight years old.

315
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,310
Thea!

316
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,245
Held my own. Barely. Let's go.

317
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,010
Make your father proud.
Come with us.

318
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,013
Felicity, I know
you were wondering.

319
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,523
It's from <i>Raiders...</i> Kiss the floor.

320
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,525
<i>I've got Thea and the map.</i>

321
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,823
Let's move.

322
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,249
Here, let me help you.

323
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:52,546
Okay. God, that bitch
has a really powerful kick.

324
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,669
I think she might have broken
one of my ribs.

325
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,172
I assure you, that will be
the last time you have to face her.

326
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,093
Yeah, you'll get
no complaints from me.

327
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,763
This Athena doesn't seem like
the type who'd give up easily.

328
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,182
I intend to take the choice
out of her hands

329
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,184
by taking Merlyn's map far from here.

330
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,929
I know the toll
a father can have on a child.

331
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,315
Even long after he's gone.
This is my burden, not yours.

332
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,527
You didn't tell me that this
was the box from <i>Hellraiser.</i>

333
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,774
Take care of each other.

334
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,563
That was a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

335
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,615
Okay, wait. Now, how're you
gonna open it?

336
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,114
I'll find someone
who can unlock the cipher.

337
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,161
My people invented
mathematics after all.

338
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,330
Yeah, no, no, no.
Not this type of mathematics.

339
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,327
Wait. Look, you can't
go out there by yourself.

340
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,036
Not with Athena's assassins
looking for you.

341
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,746
She said that's what
she wanted to do, Thea.

342
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,127
- Yeah, it's not what I want.
- Speedy.

343
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,676
You made it clear
once I acquired the map,

344
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,425
you'd have no interest
in your father or the League.

345
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,349
And you made it clear that this map,
it leads, to what,

346
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,471
something ancient and powerful?

347
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,054
Okay, you cannot take this on
by yourself.

348
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,351
Plus, we have the world's
greatest mathematician right there.

349
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,611
And the protection
that you're gonna need

350
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,065
to keep that thing safe,
while you try to open it...

351
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,616
I appreciate the gesture.

352
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:05,944
Can you do it?

353
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,372
Well, in my experience,
anything locked can be hacked.

354
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,199
Usually, by me.

355
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,749
Thea, are you sure about this?

356
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,829
Nyssa's right.

357
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,333
You did say that you wanted
nothing to do with Malcolm's legacy.

358
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,463
I know, okay.

359
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,591
Look, I can't believe
that I'm even saying this,

360
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,054
but after
seeing those assassins, I...

361
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,520
This all just became too real.

362
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,023
Nyssa gave you an out.
I don't know why you don't take it.

363
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,314
I don't know how to explain it to you
right now, okay.

364
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,738
I just... I need you to trust me.

365
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,658
All right, you ready?

366
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,408
To go to prison for stealing
evidence? No, not really.

367
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,989
I'm doing the stealing,
you're doing the hacking.

368
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,454
Something tells me the police
don't make that distinction.

369
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,883
This could be the last time I'm here,
not as a suspect.

370
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,584
Okay, but how long
is this gonna take?

371
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,799
- My worry is 25 to life.
- Come on.

372
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,386
- Okay, keep watch.
- What!

373
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,971
I thought you said
no one else is gonna be here.

374
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,848
We are here, aren't we?

375
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,404
This might take a while.

376
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,609
Crap.

377
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,698
Come on.

378
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,078
This is police access only.
What're you doing here?

379
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,418
Nick Anastas! Hey!

380
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,752
- It has been a while.
- Do I know you?

381
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:46,594
Yes, of course. Curtis Holt.
We met through Dinah Drake.

382
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,220
She's my friend and your Sergeant or
Lieutenant, or was it just Detective?

383
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,893
Either way,
I'm meeting her here for dinner,

384
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,939
but I kind of got lost
in this new building.

385
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,861
I mean, I really haven't seen
this place since it was blown up.

386
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,404
I can give you a tour if you want,

387
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,447
while you're waiting
for Lieutenant Drake.

388
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,821
She usually doesn't show up
for her shift for another hour.

389
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,412
Totally Dinah. She's a major slacker.

390
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,741
- Come on.
- Yeah.

391
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,921
Gotcha.

392
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,268
- Nyssa.
- Husband.

393
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,309
You got to stop doing that.

394
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,393
I do have a wife now,

395
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,482
and she doesn't like it.

396
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,189
But that's the fun of it.

397
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,776
Thea might want you to stay,

398
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,742
doesn't mean you have to.

399
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,245
The point about Felicity's utility
was well taken.

400
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,246
So was her point about wanting
nothing to do with Malcolm.

401
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,202
It's her life
and she must find her own truth.

402
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,839
I think her truth is a new life,
that she's earned.

403
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,628
She's earned your support for
her actions, whatever those may be.

404
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,634
I can understand why she would be
conflicted with Malcolm.

405
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,391
He was her father.
I am not conflicted. He was evil.

406
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,970
And Thea should not be charged
with righting his wrongs.

407
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,976
My father was also evil.

408
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,309
And I've dedicated the rest of
my life to righting his wrongs.

409
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,146
From what I understand,
you've done the same.

410
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:32,030
But my father asked me to.
With his dying wish, he asked me to.

411
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,532
Back on Lian Yu,
Merlyn gave up his life for Thea,

412
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,955
just as your father did for you.

413
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,374
I believe
Thea owes him the same debt.

414
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,328
Well, it is convenient for you
to believe that.

415
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,084
Because Thea gets you closer
to what you want.

416
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,713
So, do not pretend that
you're selflessly supporting her.

417
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:53,964
And never ever lecture me
on what I owe my sister.

418
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,141
- If you think I would...
- Nailed it!

419
00:23:58,646 --> 00:23:59,887
I nailed it, I got it.

420
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,892
- You've unlocked the map?
- No.

421
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,314
Okay, so,
what do you mean by "nailed it"?

422
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,017
I figured out how to unlock
the <i>Hellraiser</i> cube,

423
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,522
but I just thought
you should do the honors.

424
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,441
You've heard of the
Fibonacci sequence, right?

425
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,738
Let's assume not.

426
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,861
Fibonacci sequence
is a mathematical pattern

427
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,741
dating back
to Pingala's formula in 450 B.C.

428
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,820
- Wow.
- Yeah.

429
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,497
When you said "ancient,"
you were not kidding.

430
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,573
I never kid.

431
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,250
Except where my marriage
is concerned, apparently.

432
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,458
The Fibonacci sequence.

433
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,039
Every number is the sum
of the two previous numbers,

434
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,259
so, finding the two starting ones,
that's the tricky part.

435
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,586
What are the starting numbers?

436
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,009
- Ten and thirteen.
- Is she right?

437
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,091
1013 was the year
the League was founded.

438
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,268
- And Malcolm's birthday.
- Okay, sit.

439
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,979
Try 10, 13, 23.

440
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,892
- Thirty-six.
- Fifty-nine.

441
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,023
Ninety-five.

442
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,897
- I was always good at math.
- That's right.

443
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,030
Hmm.

444
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,665
What does it say?

445
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,879
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

446
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,890
Why're you burning it?

447
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,600
She's heating it.

448
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,562
The League writes in hidden text that
can only be revealed through flame.

449
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,782
- You don't remember?
- I don't want to.

450
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:43,657
I don't know what's going on with
him, but just keep working on it.

451
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,622
- Why isn't the flame working?
- There's two possibilities for that.

452
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,205
Either Malcolm was using
a different type of invisible ink...

453
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,460
Or?

454
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,088
Or there's nothing on this
and we're wasting our time.

455
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,252
What's this?

456
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,176
I thought since old-school wasn't
working, I'd try some new-school.

457
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:03,180
The scanner can make
a 3-D voxel-based recreation.

458
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,936
I didn't start using a computer
until I was 25.

459
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,354
That explains a lot.

460
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,770
If I can duplicate the map digitally,

461
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,026
there might be some hidden markers
on there that we can trace.

462
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,947
- Sounds complicated.
- It is. Very.

463
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:27,455
So, it would be really great
to not be distracted, you know.

464
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,752
Very true.

465
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,964
I'll stay here to make sure
you remain uninterrupted...

466
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,793
- Sister-wife.
- Okay.

467
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,060
Okay, so, somebody is grumpy.

468
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,889
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to be supportive.

469
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,348
But?

470
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,106
But I don't understand why you think
that this is your responsibility.

471
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,812
He died for me.

472
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,399
Okay? I don't know what it is,

473
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,906
but ever since
I found out about this, I just...

474
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,323
I feel like
I can't run away from it yet.

475
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,784
No, you see,
that's where we are different.

476
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,540
You see this
as us running away from something,

477
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,373
but I see this
as us running towards something.

478
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,582
Something way better.

479
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,464
You know just, I don't know.
I just feel like

480
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,799
recently, you've just been finding
any excuse you can

481
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,130
for us to stay here.

482
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,099
Unlike all my boyfriends in the past,

483
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:30,180
I do find it kind of cute
when you're being insecure.

484
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,146
I just don't wanna
lose you again, Thea.

485
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,194
That map is not my future.

486
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,162
You are.

487
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,582
I love a good old murder board.

488
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,295
Yeah. Feeling very Alan J. Pakula.

489
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,346
Sometimes, I forget
you're not Felicity.

490
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,268
Now, look. I know this has probably
already occurred to you,

491
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,187
but all Hill did was
take the evidence from your hands.

492
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,014
That's not necessarily proof.

493
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,190
Not to mention,
her name did not pop up...

494
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,520
- She's dirty.
- Are you asking me, or telling me?

495
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,357
You tell me if these drugs
are the same kind Diaz pushes...

496
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,113
If Hill took it off your hands,
that would be pretty damning.

497
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,490
And the fact that so much
of this department is so crooked,

498
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,620
would make a lot more sense
if it was rotten from the top down.

499
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,700
So, are they Diaz's drugs?

500
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,662
I don't know yet.
Maybe we should just try it.

501
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,039
Or we can read the analysis.

502
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,426
- Oh.
- What?

503
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,882
- It's Vertigo.
- Vertigo?

504
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,265
I heard of this back in Central City.
It's a hallucinogenic, right?

505
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:55,019
Yeah, but the good thing is that
this isn't Diaz's drug of choice.

506
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,601
- So, Hill is clean.
- Looks like.

507
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,737
You actually look disappointed.

508
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,782
Well, because it means
we're back to square one.

509
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,900
Yeah.

510
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,535
Thinking about
taking that thing with you?

511
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,833
One hundred percent no.

512
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,959
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

513
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,462
I mean, Roy only thinks
I'm gonna leave him

514
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,168
and a bunch of crazy assassins
that my dead dad organized

515
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,348
are trying to kill me,
so, my life is just great.

516
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,221
You know, Thea,
you don't have to do this.

517
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,268
You don't have to leave
everything to Nyssa.

518
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,307
Myself, and John and Felicity,
we will stop Athena.

519
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,405
You can go, you can live
your happily ever after with Roy.

520
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,490
Here, I thought
you were supposed to go live yours.

521
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,533
Felicity, she told me you stopped
being the Green Arrow.

522
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:57,002
Yeah, that was the plan.
Life interfered.

523
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,791
- John got hurt.
- He did.

524
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,172
But he's not hurt anymore.

525
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,047
I worry that he would be
in over his head,

526
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,503
going up against Diaz alone.

527
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,339
I don't think anything's
over John's head.

528
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:14,177
You might be right.
I don't know, I...

529
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,603
I gave it up because
I wanted to be a better father.

530
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:25,397
But William accepts the idea
that I'm the Green Arrow.

531
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,733
Plus, I don't want to give it up.

532
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,738
- I don't know why.
- I do.

533
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,534
Because being the Green Arrow
is what makes you feel complete.

534
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,665
For some reason, when you put that
hood on, it enables you

535
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,342
to become
the best version of yourself.

536
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,507
We're supposed to be
talking about you.

537
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,344
Maybe we are.
I don't know.

538
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,263
Maybe that's the reason why I can't
seem to give this life up. I...

539
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:05,278
I don't know, maybe I'm hoping that
somehow, I'll get the same thing,

540
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:11,659
and find the best version of myself,
whoever she is.

541
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,910
Athena's group of assassins,
found them.

542
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,251
- Where are they?
- Star City gas plant.

543
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,795
It holds the city's entire supply.

544
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,747
- At worst, they could blow it up.
- Why?

545
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,831
It's not their MO.

546
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,042
It is if they're using the plant

547
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,671
to leverage us
into giving up the map.

548
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,503
Clearly, Athena
doesn't know you very well.

549
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,840
Yeah, too bad it's not
Ollie's choice. It's mine.

550
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,175
You can't give in to them.

551
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,353
I can't let them hold the city
hostage, okay. This is still my home.

552
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,057
So, what, am I going alone?

553
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,859
Overwatch,
you have eyes on the Guild?

554
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,611
No, not yet, but I'm reading
a frequency spike,

555
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,071
which means
they just activated a bomb.

556
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,373
Athena's way of putting pressure
on our negotiations.

557
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,916
Fan out and find the bomb.

558
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,789
Multiple heat signatures.
Guys, they got you surrounded.

559
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,586
Head on a swivel.

560
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,132
- Where are the new assassins?
- Everywhere.

561
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,755
You want your map so bad? Come out.

562
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,343
Let's talk.

563
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:23,022
Perhaps your father taught you
some sense after all.

564
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,728
But you're mistaken if you think
that all we want is the map.

565
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,614
The map is meaningless
without spilling your blood.

566
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,826
You're really starting
to piss me off.

567
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,426
Your father spoke often
about you.

568
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,602
He was always ashamed
of your weakness.

569
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,952
Don't forget, guys,
we still have a bomb situation.

570
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,666
There's always a bomb situation.

571
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,369
I can trace the frequency root
of the detonator,

572
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,499
it is 17 feet to your right.

573
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,127
- Lead the way.
<i>- Up.</i>

574
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,676
Merlyn said
he tried to teach you to be strong.

575
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,016
- Clearly, he failed.
- I'm not my father.

576
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,189
This isn't working.

577
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,226
I know. It's a collapsible circuit.

578
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,644
I can freeze it.
I have done it before.

579
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,981
No! No, it's a mercury switch.
That will definitely set it off.

580
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,111
What do I do?

581
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,526
Short-circuit it.

582
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,203
I'm out of electricity arrows
right now at the moment, Felicity.

583
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,738
<i>Green Arrow?</i>

584
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,247
On its way!

585
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,746
Got it.

586
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,593
Woo! Nice work.

587
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,755
Thea!

588
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,531
You've lost. It's as clear
as your imminent death.

589
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,733
You don't know
what you're talking about.

590
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,696
I know that you bleed. I win.

591
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,407
You don't want to do that.

592
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,128
Are you all right?

593
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,008
I learned a few tricks from Merlyn.

594
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,971
Wait. Where did she go?

595
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,806
That woman is hard to kill.
Were you really going to burn it?

596
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,650
To ashes.

597
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,190
The other assassins either fled
or they're wrapped up.

598
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,771
I really didn't miss those guys.

599
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:17,901
Speedy, the map.

600
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,698
They were being literal.
They needed your blood to spill.

601
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,904
That's definitely not "X"
marks the spot.

602
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,577
Where does it lead?

603
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,283
I believe I know where.

604
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,378
Nanolithography, the map
is printed with bacteria.

605
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,800
That's gross.

606
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,469
When exposed to the enzymes
of Thea's DNA, it reveals itself.

607
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,012
Ancient League secret?

608
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,589
No, no.
This is bleeding edge science.

609
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,175
This requires an atomic force
microscope. Leave it to Merlyn.

610
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,261
Nyssa, you said you know
what this map leads to?

611
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,721
These are ley lines.

612
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,851
Great. Ley lines. You've only seen
those with Damien Darhk.

613
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,102
These are different.

614
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,480
I thought they only intersected
on one place on Earth.

615
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,813
- Doesn't look that way from this.
- Indeed. These lines are global.

616
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,069
This suggests the existence of
three intersections

617
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,401
of a kind I thought
only existed on Nanda Parbat.

618
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,862
Right, but what only exists
on Nanda Parbat really?

619
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,288
I mean, besides really
depressing decor.

620
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,618
I know now why Merlyn called
his new league the "Thanatos Guild."

621
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,293
Thanatos
is the personification of death.

622
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,791
- In Greek mythology.
- Exactly.

623
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,090
I believe these lines suggests the
existence of three installments.

624
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,249
The three what?

625
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,216
Your father discovered the existence
of three Lazarus Pits.

626
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,677
Of course, he did.

627
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:26,803
Thea, come on.

628
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,681
Hey, Roy, just...
Let's give her some space.

629
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,682
Thank you, sir.

630
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,186
Officer.

631
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,484
Nick. Or should I just call you
"Officer" because we're at work?

632
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,620
Nick's fine. You're becoming
a regular around here.

633
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,613
Yeah, well, you know,
I just stopped by to...

634
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,830
See Lieutenant Drake.

635
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,952
To ask you out. To dinner.

636
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,002
Or drinks or like just coffee,

637
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,455
or we can just
walk down the street and talk...

638
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,882
- Yes.
- "Yes"?

639
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,427
- I get off work tonight at 7:00.
- Yeah.

640
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,345
So, should we say 8:00?

641
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,638
8:00 is awesome. 8:00 is perfect.

642
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,471
Yeah, I'll make reservations,
and I'll text you.

643
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,773
- Sounds like a plan. See you tonight.
- Okay.

644
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,281
- Hey.
- What're you doing here?

645
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,658
Getting back on the horse, D.

646
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,245
Back in the game, back in the saddle.

647
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,665
I'm gonna get really
right into... What's wrong?

648
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,082
I checked intake and evidence lockup
for any Vertigo-related cases.

649
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,497
- And?
- There aren't any.

650
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,798
Is that not a good thing?

651
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,923
There aren't any Vertigo cases
because they've all been kicked.

652
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,222
And the evidence released
by Captain Hill.

653
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,972
So, she's dirty. She did it for Diaz.

654
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,977
Ricardo Diaz is pushing Vertigo.

655
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,772
- Hey.
- Hey.

656
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:09,118
Look, I'm sorry
for storming out last night.

657
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:14,286
I just really needed some space, but
it really had nothing to do with you.

658
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,703
It's fine.

659
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,873
I'm just trying to figure out if you
packed that bag to come with me,

660
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,953
or Nyssa.

661
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,961
I mean, it's pretty obvious she wants
to destroy the new Lazarus Pits

662
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,758
just like she did
with the original one.

663
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,380
I mean, can you blame her?

664
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,885
What would happen if the League
or the Guild,

665
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,558
or anyone got their hands on it,
how dangerous that would be?

666
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,558
So, you are gonna go with Nyssa?

667
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,355
Look, last night,
Ollie and I were talking,

668
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:46,113
and we were talking about how when,

669
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,117
you know, he becomes the Green Arrow,

670
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,947
he feels complete.

671
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,953
And I was thinking that maybe
that's because when...

672
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,078
When he puts that hood on,

673
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,586
he gets to right our fathers' wrongs.

674
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,840
And maybe this could be my calling,

675
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,548
this could be
what I've been looking for.

676
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,132
So, you've made up your mind.

677
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,560
You know what,

678
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,726
so have I.

679
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,860
- I'm gonna go with you.
- What?

680
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:33,069
- No, no, you don't need to do that.
- Yes, I do.

681
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,613
I told you,
it doesn't matter where we go,

682
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,073
as long as we go together.

683
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,368
God, how did I get to be so lucky.

684
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,588
Hmm... I think it has something
to do with a stolen purse.

685
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,709
Please, just

686
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,925
be careful, all right?

687
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,052
And if you need anything,

688
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,306
or if you don't need anything,
just call me.

689
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,307
- Keep her safe.
- You know I will.

690
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,650
You drew them back into this, Nyssa,

691
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,532
that carries with it
a certain responsibility.

692
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:20,242
Thea is your sister
and the daughter of Malcolm Merlyn.

693
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,785
She's less in need of protection
than you think.

694
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,800
This is a Horchus dagger.

695
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,002
In the League of Assassins,

696
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,679
it symbolizes
the cutting of marital bonds.

697
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,426
I hereby annul our marriage.

698
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,396
Nyssa, as wedding gifts go,
this isn't half bad.

699
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,400
Be well, Oliver.

700
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,570
Well,

701
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,402
this is it.

702
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,285
Thanks for clearing
a few things out for me.

703
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,707
Of course.

704
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,003
- One more piece of advice?
- Sure.

705
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,422
If you're gonna wear the hood,

706
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,008
you shouldn't
string John along anymore.

707
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:16,096
I thought I was the one who gave
that wise sibling advice.

708
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:20,176
Nope. That has never been the case.

709
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,643
I'm gonna miss you so much.

710
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,605
You'll be with me the whole time.

711
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,333
Goodbye, Speedy.
