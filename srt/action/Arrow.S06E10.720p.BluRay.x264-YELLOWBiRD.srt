1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,668
<i>Previouslyon</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,167
The prosecution's smoking gun

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,710
is a witness
who is willing to testify

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,417
that you are the Green Arrow.
It's someone on the team.

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,090
Dinah isn't the witness, Oliver,
it's me.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,467
You're off the team.

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,556
It's been real, y'all.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,096
I'm out, too.

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,559
I'm done.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,184
So we've got 'em
fighting with each other

11
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,890
instead of fighting us.

12
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,646
This is only the beginning.

13
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,033
Mr. Bertinelli, I think you're gonna
like these numbers.

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,909
We need a name
for the Panam-X that's, uh, coming in.

15
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,582
Christening ships does make it seem
more legit if the IRS checks in.

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,920
How about <i>TheHuntress?</i>
After my cousin.

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,633
Very good.

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,589
Thank you, sir.

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,425
Who the hell are you?

20
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,225
Someone important.

21
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,683
Real important.

22
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,146
You don't look it.
How'd you get past my men?

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,728
I blew them a kiss.

24
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,783
Jerry Bertinelli
of the eponymous crime family

25
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,985
and the last of his kind.

26
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,457
The rest of your family is either
dead or incarcerated.

27
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,704
You... You writing a book?

28
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,251
I have heard

29
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:32,002
that sometimes ships appear
on your docking manifest,

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,799
but never actually arrive.

31
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,970
Sometimes ships arrive

32
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,339
and never end up
on the docking manifest.

33
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,550
Well, it's very profound.

34
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,643
If the price is right, maybe,
maybe we can facilitate a few things.

35
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,850
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

36
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,275
We want to buy you out.

37
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,399
I got a feeling
you're not hearing me.

38
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,442
Port's not for sale.

39
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,365
Take a walk.

40
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,161
Oh, it sounds to me like
you want a kiss, too.

41
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,796
You have 48 hours
to consider our proposal.

42
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,641
Don't you have a daughter
attending Columbia University?

43
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,018
I've always wanted to visit New York.

44
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,743
Hey, you.

45
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,331
Looks like you need this.

46
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:53,038
Oh, John Diggle, the savior of souls
and bringer of java.

47
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,373
- Thank you.
- I have been called.

48
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,800
I guess I have to find ways
to be useful.

49
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,512
You're working overtime
trying to find Cayden James,

50
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,510
and I'm still on the disabled list.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,217
Well, not for long. Curtis is on his
way over and we will fix you.

52
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,019
We have the technology.

53
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,929
Ah, I'm not the Six Million Dollar Man.

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,397
Not yet, you're not.

55
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,270
And more like $2.24 million man,

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,896
because Curtis and I
are stretching pennies

57
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,773
with Helix Dynamics as it is.

58
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,940
Oh, speak of the devil,
that little psychic.

59
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,276
Oh. He's early. He'll be here soon.

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,577
- Who's early?
- Curtis.

61
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,743
Shouldn't you be getting home?

62
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,121
Raisa must be making quadruple
overtime by now.

63
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,373
Raisa is doing just fine.
I mean, William loves her.

64
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,580
- William doesn't know you're here.
- I know.

65
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,381
And I don't like it, but...

66
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,217
We need to find Cayden James.

67
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,254
Are we making
any progress on that front?

68
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,513
Despite my 21st consecutive
all-nighter, no.

69
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,184
He's either the first bad guy
to ghost us

70
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,479
or he's just biding time.

71
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,064
- Black Siren.
- Another strikeout.

72
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,939
I can't track her cry and Cayden must
have inserted some sort of Trojan

73
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,270
into the software, it's confusing
our facial recognition algorithms.

74
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,354
I cannot find her.

75
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,941
All right, we will continue
with the low-tech option.

76
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,991
I will go out up there again tonight.

77
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,365
Yeah, and every time you do,
you're playing Russian roulette,

78
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,288
considering you're being followed
and all.

79
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,206
And the Anti-Vigilante Law.

80
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,034
I'm not worried.
You should not be either.

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,833
The three of us,
we will solve this problem together.

82
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,375
Like your haircut. It's nice.

83
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,429
I didn't get a haircut.
Curtis, it's fine.

84
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,591
I'm really appreciative
that you're helping John.

85
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,425
No hard feelings?

86
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,970
No.

87
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,226
That wasn't super awkward.

88
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,899
Ooh. Let's get to work.

89
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,525
Yep?

90
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,950
- Hi.
- Hey, look who it is.

91
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,287
Ah, to what do I owe the pleasure?
Sit down.

92
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,490
Uh, well...

93
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,960
I heard you needed a new assistant.

94
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,036
Yeah.

95
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,456
Developed some trust issues
with the last one.

96
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,583
Yeah, Ollie told me you fired him.

97
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,343
Yeah, about that.

98
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,129
He also mentioned
that you wanted to, what?

99
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,589
Err on the side of forgiveness?

100
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,180
Yeah, I mean, look,
you know everyone makes mistakes.

101
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,478
And I totally get why you did
what you did.

102
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,898
But I just feel like
it might come across bad for optics.

103
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,029
It might look like you're retaliating
against a whistle-blower.

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,027
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

105
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,816
But, Thea,

106
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,741
Oliver shouldn't have to work
shoulder to shoulder

107
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,664
with a guy
who's testifying against him.

108
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,617
Doesn't mean you're not still down
an assistant.

109
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,953
Yeah. Well, actually, I hired
a replacement this morning.

110
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,162
Oh.

111
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,958
What I could really use
is a chief of staff.

112
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,678
Almost there.

113
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,684
Just slipping past the radiocarpal.

114
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,265
Yeah.

115
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,774
Boom!

116
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,023
- Chip implanted.
- That's it?

117
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,237
- Seems simple.
- Yeah, for you,

118
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,815
- I mean, making the chip.
- That was the hard...

119
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,077
What was that?

120
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,037
Some kind of electro-magnetic
frequency interference.

121
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,081
- From the chip?
- No, I doubt it, but...

122
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,159
It's probably nothing.

123
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,536
All right, the moment of truth.

124
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,917
Can you make a fist without a tremor?

125
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,088
Round Two. El busto.

126
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:34,267
Why don't you just stop pouring money
into this? Into me.

127
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,514
You let us worry about the money,
okay? We're going to do this.

128
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,569
I can tinker with the design
some more when I get home.

129
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,191
Or you could do it here.

130
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,572
Hard pass. After this morning's
awkwardness, I am good.

131
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,532
- See you, guys.
- See you.

132
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,909
Please tell me you can get <i>Halo</i>
on that thing.

133
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,366
If I have to go one more week
without shooting a bad guy,

134
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,450
I'm gonna bust.

135
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,287
Funny. I always pictured you
like a more <i>CallofDuty</i>...

136
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,341
What?

137
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,513
Anastas.

138
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,644
Who collared this guy?
We've had a warrant on him for weeks.

139
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,021
Nobody. He just up and turned
himself in five minutes ago.

140
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,569
- Turned himself...
- It's crazy. Fifth one this week.

141
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,943
All of a sudden these bad guys
grew a conscience.

142
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,108
Did you like my presents?

143
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,115
- What are you doing here?
- Seeing you.

144
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,913
You know, anybody in this office
could arrest you.

145
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,241
- Hell, I could arrest you.
- For what?

146
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,244
I'm a Central City police officer.

147
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,921
The only rap on me
is that I'm presumed dead.

148
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,627
Then again, I was an undercover,
so that death is probably bogus.

149
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,387
The Vigilante put the fear of God
in these guys.

150
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,216
At least the Vigilante
isn't killing them.

151
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,177
Most guys just send flowers.

152
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,148
How about a stroll
by the pier instead?

153
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,776
Tomorrow, after your shift ends?

154
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,073
Sure.

155
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,654
Okay.

156
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,051
Clear.

157
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,261
- What's going on?
- We've been compromised.

158
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,841
Curtis brought down some equipment
into the bunker for John's implant.

159
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,016
We got massive signal interference.

160
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,639
- We got lucky.
- Three months ago,

161
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,304
when Laurel infiltrated the bunker.

162
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,972
She stole one of Curtis' T-Spheres.

163
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,682
James had it on him
back at Starling Stadium.

164
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,935
We were so focused
on what she could have taken.

165
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,112
We never thought about
what she could've left behind.

166
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,940
- Like a bug.
- Exactly.

167
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,200
Then she's been watching us
for months.

168
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,826
I put it on loop, okay?
Audio and visual of the bunker.

169
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,956
- He doesn't know that we know.
- All right.

170
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,124
I spoke with Lyla.

171
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,869
She says we can use
A.R.G.U.S. for the time being.

172
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,417
- That's smart.
- No, smart is Cayden James

173
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,999
being one step ahead of us
from the veryjump, Oliver.

174
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,751
I hate to belabor
the depressingly obvious,

175
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,259
but secret identities?
No longer secret.

176
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,092
The block between 74th and Jansen

177
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,722
just lost
their security signal uplink.

178
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,804
- That doesn't just happen on its own.
- Cayden James?

179
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,105
I'm on it.

180
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,771
Hey, hey, hey. Stand down.

181
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,232
I just needed to get your attention.

182
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,234
You're a hard man to find.

183
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,694
Have you ever considered a website?

184
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:45,329
Or maybe a spotlight in the sky,
big silhouette of an arrow?

185
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,750
What do you want?

186
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,791
- You know who I am?
- Jerry Bertinelli.

187
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,424
- You're in the Bertinelli Syndicate.
- I am the Bertinelli Syndicate.

188
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,001
At least, what's left of it.

189
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,177
And I can't go down without a fight.

190
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,845
In five seconds,
you're gonna be in a fight.

191
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,924
Just hear me out. Look, I...

192
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,847
I never actually wanted
to get in this life.

193
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,849
I know, but we do certain things
for family.

194
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,055
Am I right?

195
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,646
Now, the ports, these docks,
it's all we got left.

196
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,442
And last night,
these people came over,

197
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,940
threatened to take it from me.

198
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,489
You know, some dweeb in glasses,
a thug,

199
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,237
a woman with super powers.

200
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,866
- And you know them?
- Maybe.

201
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,913
Yeah, no, I figured you might.

202
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,032
They're looking to control the docks.

203
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,417
So talk to your cousin.

204
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,420
She's been underground.
So I'm asking you.

205
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,338
Do you really think

206
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,334
that I'm gonna help you
win a turf war?

207
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,214
Well, I think you're
the enemy of my enemy.

208
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,221
Which makes us allies.

209
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,436
We need to know what's on this.

210
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,356
Hi, Felicity, how are you?
Are you busy with anything?

211
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,406
Can you help me with something?
You look tired.

212
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

213
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,865
Jerry Bertinelli gave that to me.

214
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,826
The port is the only thing
the Bertinelli family has left.

215
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,784
Cayden James and Black Siren
are trying to take it from them.

216
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,369
So we're getting into bed
with the Bertinellis now?

217
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,624
I remember last time you got in bed
with one of the Bertinellis.

218
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,297
It did not work out well.

219
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,756
I have a long memory for
these sorts of things, call me crazy.

220
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,964
Two nights ago they paid him a visit.
This is the security footage.

221
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,514
They made a threat against
his daughter.

222
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,058
Well, what's on here
might help us locate them.

223
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,225
That's the plan.

224
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,344
Well, we'll know
about the license plate.

225
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,605
Old school. I like it.

226
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,819
A little bit of old school
combined with some new school,

227
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,068
and I'm about to find us
this Cayden James needle

228
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,319
in the Star City haystack.

229
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,070
Do it.

230
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,453
I mean, I was thinking after school
we could hit up the zoo.

231
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,373
They have this new reptile room
with a Komodo dragon.

232
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,704
Thing's so big, it could eat a cow.

233
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,294
- That's dope, right?
- I guess so.

234
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,500
What's up, sweets?

235
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,715
I thought you were all about
this animal stuff.

236
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,504
I am, but...

237
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,427
Why aren't you going to work today?

238
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,299
I'm going through
a little transitional period.

239
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,805
- Will I have to leave again?
- Hey...

240
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,058
No one will ever take you
away from me.

241
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,813
Ever again.

242
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,449
- What's up, dawg?
- What's up, dawg?

243
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,901
I brought crogurts.

244
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,155
- "Crogurts"?
- I didn't name them. I just eat them.

245
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,865
- Hey, Zoe.
- Hi, Curtis.

246
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,916
Hey, go get your bag.
We're about to leave.

247
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,127
Must be great having her back, huh?

248
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,539
Best feeling in the world.

249
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,339
You don't look like you're feeling
the best feeling in the world though.

250
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,721
I can't shake how everything
went down with Oliver.

251
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,509
In order to do right for me,
I had to betray him.

252
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,140
You had to put your daughter first.

253
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,892
She's family.

254
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,558
Is that why you called me over?

255
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,649
Actually, I was thinking...

256
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,656
All the evidence Agent Watson said
she has against me

257
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,199
has to be digitized, right?

258
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,069
- Yeah.
- So what if

259
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,701
that evidence suddenly vanished?

260
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,915
Then I'll be able to...

261
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,951
What do you call it? Um...

262
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,879
- Recant.
- You put your family first, Rene.

263
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,506
That's nothing
to be ashamed of about.

264
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,544
I mean, now, accessing the files
might be a little easier

265
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,131
now that the case has been moved back
to the Star City DA, but...

266
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,467
So, that's a yes...

267
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,269
No, that's a "Let me think about it."

268
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,231
Fine, yeah, I'll do it.
We all know I'll do it.

269
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,150
Awesome.
That's what I'm talking about, hoss.

270
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,987
That was
the worst stakeout of my life.

271
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,690
Do you remember, it was like, what?
Minus one?

272
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,401
It was freezing.
I was freezing my ass off

273
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,736
and the car's heater broke down.

274
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,914
- I warned you about that.
- Yeah, you did and I didn't listen.

275
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,035
I think there's a life lesson
in there somewhere.

276
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,164
Oh...

277
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,543
I think I drank a gallon of coffee
that night to stay warm.

278
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,251
I had to pee so...
I never had to pee so bad in my life.

279
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,382
And I had to go back behind the car.

280
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,384
So you know, I mean,
I wasn't gonna ask the scumbag

281
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,965
if I could use his bathroom.

282
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,301
Oh, God, and the second
I go back there,

283
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,056
he decides to make a run for it.

284
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,889
That son of a bitch.
I had to go chasing after him,

285
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,474
fall face-first into the snow bank

286
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,732
and knock myself out on the curb.

287
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,826
This is complicated. I know.

288
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,284
I'm used to complicated.
This is a whole new level.

289
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,077
It doesn't have to be.

290
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,339
I stopped being the Black Canary
five weeks ago.

291
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,252
I really want to uncomplicate
my life right now.

292
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,713
Just so long
you don't forget to live it.

293
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,523
Sorry.

294
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,438
Text from an informant.

295
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,565
My next target's on the move.

296
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,827
Don't worry.

297
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,863
I'm not gonna kill him.

298
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,825
Well, just make sure you bring him in
when I'm off duty.

299
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,752
Okay? Because all this intake
is giving me carpal tunnel.

300
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,804
Pen?

301
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,020
I can always count on you.

302
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,815
So, Quentin told me the good news.

303
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,441
- You're back with us?
- Yes, I am.

304
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,943
And you're happy about that?

305
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,245
Well, I just sorry that I can't be
of more help to you

306
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,657
and the team, or lack thereof.

307
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,076
It's fine.

308
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,046
Well, I just know you need
the manpower right now,

309
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,873
and I'm not just there...

310
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,003
Thea,

311
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,509
you will always be my Speedy

312
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,837
whether you're using
a bow and arrow or not.

313
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,138
Yeah.

314
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,846
- Found him.
- Where?

315
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,101
His vehicle is parked outside
a warehouse in Adams Heights.

316
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,024
- Looks like he's alone.
- And he doesn't know that we know.

317
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,601
- Okay, talk me in.
- Oliver,

318
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,652
if you do that,
you'll be going in solo.

319
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,985
Let us stake the place out,
do some recon.

320
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,986
We have the chance
to take him by surprise.

321
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,157
We can't pass it up.

322
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,202
- Hey, Ollie.
- Yeah?

323
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,200
Go get him.

324
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,836
Overwatch, I'm in the east sector.

325
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,920
Where to?

326
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,056
Okay, you're coming up
on the main floor.

327
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,099
Same three heat sigs have been
there for a while now.

328
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,472
Good odds that's our target.

329
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,188
I'm sensing some impatience,
Ms. Lance.

330
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,314
Would you care to elucidate?

331
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,024
I'm not impatient. I'm annoyed.

332
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,697
We have the numbers.

333
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,991
Why not just take the pier
from the Bertinellis?

334
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,451
Oh, no.

335
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,745
- Not impatient at all.
- Mr. Sheck.

336
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,997
No need to stir the pot.

337
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,576
I think you'll find that brute force,
while it's easy,

338
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,332
is exceedingly messy.

339
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,546
I prefer precision.

340
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,211
Design over chaos.

341
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,670
You've taught yourself
some new tricks.

342
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,422
No more games.

343
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,507
Overwatch, I have the target.

344
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,298
That's a whole lot of bad news.

345
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,674
Arrow, you're about to get company.

346
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,255
Oliver?

347
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,840
Overwatch, do you copy?

348
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,301
I'm afraid Ms. Smoak can't hear you.

349
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,721
You see, I also have some tricks,
Mr. Queen.

350
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,515
And I have friends.

351
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,192
Hello, Kapiushon.

352
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,895
How were your holidays?

353
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,439
Funny you should mention that.

354
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,320
Looks like we're getting
a late Christmas present.

355
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,705
I only targeted criminals.

356
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:55,007
I thought you'd know vigilantes
are criminals, Mr. Mayor.

357
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,385
You'll find that I don't play
games, Mr. Queen.

358
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,555
- But I do win.
- It's enough.

359
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,967
I am so sick of everyone
not killing him

360
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,552
when they get the chance.

361
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,559
Let him go.

362
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,194
You know, for a smart guy,

363
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,022
that was a dumb move.

364
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,903
There's a time and a place
for Oliver Queen's demise.

365
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,239
Now is not it.

366
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,084
So Cayden James not only has Laurel,

367
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,788
but he's backed by two
different criminal organizations.

368
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,123
And a deranged killer that we haven't

369
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,051
- been able to put down for two years.
- Oliver.

370
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,217
If Cayden James has his own posse men

371
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,175
maybe we need to think about
evening the playing field.

372
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,385
We're not folding Curtis, Rene
and Dinah back in.

373
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,475
I don't trust
they won't compromise us.

374
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,854
Cayden James told you that
he wants to watch the city burn.

375
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,735
This is no time for ego, man.

376
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,525
This is not ego.

377
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,032
John, you more than anyone know

378
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,328
you don't go into the field
with people you can't rely on.

379
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,451
Okay, then,
how about not going to the field?

380
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,622
They need to know what's going on.

381
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,166
Dinah deserves to know the truth
about her ex.

382
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,743
I agree.

383
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,128
So we share intel,

384
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,046
but that's it.

385
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,972
Is that a bottle?

386
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,097
Worse. Maybe.

387
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,937
Oh.

388
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,608
A photo album.

389
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,912
Okay, you've definitely
just hit bottom, Quentin.

390
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,115
I think we need to call your sponsor.

391
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,291
Yeah. Maybe he can
talk some sense into me.

392
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,541
Okay, well,
I've been in a coma for six months,

393
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,121
so why don't you fill me in a little?

394
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,878
Um, you know, last month,
when I was held hostage?

395
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,880
You know, she let me go.

396
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,176
What I saw in her

397
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,719
is what I see here.

398
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,338
Look, I mean,

399
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,097
everyone, even Ra's al Ghul,
has had moments of kindness.

400
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,177
Yeah.

401
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:17,266
Look, I'm not saying
that this Laurel is that bad, but...

402
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,563
I just can't stop thinking

403
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,643
that if I abandon her,

404
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,104
if I write her off
as some kind of psycho,

405
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,531
and I know this...

406
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,443
Sounds crazy,

407
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,200
but if there is just some way
to get through to her

408
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,371
and I don't take it,

409
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,370
it's going to be like
watching her die all over again.

410
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,042
You're like a father to me,
you know that?

411
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,670
If you go down this road, Quentin,
you could end up getting killed.

412
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,252
Even if you don't care
what happens to you,

413
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,550
don't forget to think about
your other daughter.

414
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,595
- Hey.
- Hey.

415
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,681
Thanks for agreeing
to meet with us.

416
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,687
Yeah, I'm not really sure
I see the point.

417
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,855
We're out of the game.

418
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,103
I don't exactly see Cayden James
respecting those types of boundaries.

419
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,278
Cayden had Laurel plant a camera
at the bunker.

420
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,028
We're all compromised.

421
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,487
How long have you all known
about this?

422
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,571
Twenty-four hours.

423
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,953
You've known we were exposed
like this for a whole day,

424
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,079
you're just telling us now?

425
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,252
Look, we thought our intel
was rock solid.

426
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,336
And then we found out
that Laurel wasn't the only one

427
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,415
that he's in league with.

428
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,593
He's working with the Bratva
and Ricardo Diaz.

429
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,965
Just what this city needs.

430
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,591
She's not the only member
of his group.

431
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,594
Dinah...

432
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,847
Vincent's working with them, too.

433
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,645
No, no.
That's insane. That's insane.

434
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,401
Vince hunts criminals,
he doesn't throw down with them.

435
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,153
Oliver saw him
with James and the rest.

436
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:52,736
Well, excuse me if, uh, I don't
just take Oliver's word for it.

437
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,787
I mean, keeping us
under surveillance,

438
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,991
sounds like he and Cayden James
have a lot in common.

439
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,249
Rene, we did that
for the good of the team.

440
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,374
Oh.

441
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,830
Is that how you sleep at night, John?

442
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,882
We were facing
an actual breach in security.

443
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,629
You guys gave up on Oliver.

444
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,306
You don't get to stay mad at Daddy
because he read your diary

445
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,883
and you get to
just skip out on curfew.

446
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,263
That's not the way it works.

447
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,219
I'm getting sick and tired
of you talking to me

448
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,771
like I did what I did on a whim.

449
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,561
I did it for my daughter.

450
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,109
And your choice
put the whole team in jeopardy, Rene.

451
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,983
We think that showed us
where you stand.

452
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,527
- Dinah.
- Where are you going, Dinah?

453
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,154
Out. I'm not gonna sit here

454
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,452
and watch you two point fingers
at everybody but yourselves.

455
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,297
Move, or get moved, hoodie.

456
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,260
Hey, stand down.
He's a friend of mine.

457
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,845
Well, he's an, uh, acquaintance.

458
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,644
Business associate? What do you need?

459
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,275
You going somewhere?

460
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,651
I got a, uh, text sent to me tonight
from inside my daughter's dorm room.

461
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,362
Cayden James, he can have the port.

462
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,693
You're running scared.

463
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,325
I'm gonna run anywhere
for my baby girl, all right?

464
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,831
As long as James and this crew
are out there,

465
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,408
she will never be safe.

466
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,077
Neither will you.

467
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,084
- But?
- But I can stop them.

468
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,128
With your help.

469
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,002
Listen to me, you do what I say,

470
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,930
we can end Cayden James.

471
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,648
I'm so glad you wanted to meet again.

472
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,357
Cayden James.

473
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,491
- You don't understand.
- You lying son of a bitch.

474
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,073
You were just getting close to me
for him.

475
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,207
Dinah, can we talk about this
somewhere else?

476
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,209
That's a great idea, Vince.

477
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,537
Precinct has a really nice room
for you.

478
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,418
Really nice interrogation room.

479
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,083
I can't let you do this.

480
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,257
I should've taken you in

481
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,835
the second you came back
into my life.

482
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,725
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,409
Charges are in place.

484
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,706
So are mine.

485
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,497
Oliver. You sure about this, man?

486
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,624
Doesn't sound like you are.

487
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,842
If we do this, Cayden James
will bring his whole group here.

488
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,089
And?

489
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,887
And Cayden
will bring everyone, Oliver.

490
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,680
I'm no place close to 100%.

491
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,510
But, look, the rest of the team...

492
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,845
- There is no "rest of the team."
- Oliver, we could use their help.

493
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,928
All you have to do is ask.

494
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,605
We would have to trust them
and we can't.

495
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,766
We can't. John, we've been over this.

496
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,477
I know. But we've also
been over other things.

497
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,860
Like you in the League of Assassins,
me, with my secret.

498
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,692
Oliver, the best partnerships
are built on forgiveness, man.

499
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,072
No one knows that
more than you and me.

500
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,828
I got arrested in front of my son.

501
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,578
Got dragged away in handcuffs
because of something that Rene did.

502
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,158
I don't know how to forgive him.

503
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:28,744
I tried.

504
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,755
John, more importantly,
what's Cayden James up to?

505
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,340
We don't know.

506
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,677
He has known our identities
for months.

507
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,221
He hasn't outed us. Why?

508
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,593
This started with you, with me,
and with Felicity.

509
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,895
Whatever comes our way,
we can handle it.

510
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,144
I believe that.

511
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,580
Are you actually eating
the old crogurt?

512
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,828
Shut up. Your old is my delicious.

513
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,534
- How's Zoe?
- I don't know.

514
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,247
I just need her to feel like
everything's going back to normal.

515
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,547
I hope it is.

516
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,959
It'll help if you could delete
whatever the DA's got.

517
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,961
We just found out that Cayden James
had the bunker bugged

518
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,045
for a couple of months,

519
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,221
so maybe we should just
take a little break

520
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,798
on saying incriminating things
like that out loud.

521
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,805
All right, all right. I'm sorry.
I'm just anxious is all.

522
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,602
I know.

523
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,351
Unfortunately, they have a backup
of all these files

524
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,230
and, even worse, their records are
saying that they have hard copies.

525
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,606
Damn.

526
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,405
Yeah. No, but I'm inside the system.
I'm just trying to find anything...

527
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,073
- Whoa.
- "Whoa," what?

528
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,072
I think I just found something. Yeah.

529
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,154
There's a record on how Watson
found out you were Wild Dog.

530
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,330
- There's an audio recording.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?

531
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,623
Well, that depends
on if you're thinking

532
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,825
that Cayden James
leaked an audio file

533
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,409
of you from the bunker to the FBI.

534
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,626
Is that what you're thinking?
That's what you're thinking, right?

535
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,454
- Yeah.
- Okay, we're on the same page.

536
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,086
Don't you knock?

537
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,634
Don't you lock your doors?

538
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,086
You look like
you were just in a fight.

539
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,546
You were just in a fight.

540
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,005
- With who?
- Vince.

541
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,470
I confronted him.
He did this and ran.

542
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,176
I'm so sorry, Dinah.

543
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,933
It was my fault for believing in him
in the first damn place.

544
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,059
And for confronting him,

545
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,981
exposing the fact that we know
about him and Cayden James.

546
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,478
That's my fault, too. It's great.

547
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,435
Curtis and I
were just talking about James

548
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,778
and the bunker being compromised.

549
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,865
Yeah, and how that might have
led to Rene being compromised.

550
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,862
You think Cayden provided
Samandra Watson with her case?

551
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,568
- That's the theory.
- A good one, though.

552
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,743
If Cayden had audio and video
on all of us, especially Oliver,

553
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,415
why would he just tee up Rene?

554
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,869
It figures he'd go after
the most handsome and charming.

555
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,422
Well, maybe when Oliver
finally takes down Cayden James,

556
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,295
we'll figure out the details
of his master plan.

557
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,460
Why assume we're gonna wait for
Oliver?

558
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,921
What are we gonna do here?

559
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,132
We're gonna sit around and wait
to see how this all plays out?

560
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,221
Hope it plays out, you mean.

561
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,264
You guys are serious about this?

562
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,226
About taking on Cayden James
and his super posse?

563
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,558
I let Vince walk once. I'm not
gonna make that mistake again.

564
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,644
And I owe that son of a bitch
some serious payback.

565
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,692
If I'm reading the room correctly,

566
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,115
we're gonna form our own team, right?

567
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,280
Right.

568
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,201
Right.

569
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,532
What's going on?

570
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,084
Signal chatter
from Bertinelli's laptop.

571
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,832
They're bringing in the Red Lions.

572
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,288
Ah. The Red Lions.

573
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,839
Chechnyan death squad.

574
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,666
Bertinelli's not gonna
let the port go without a fight.

575
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,342
Well, I'm thinking the enemy
of Cayden James

576
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,044
is my favorite death squad.

577
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,380
The Red Lions liberated a town
in Kizlyar last year.

578
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,590
Turned it into a wasteland.

579
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,300
We cannot let James's group
go up against these guys.

580
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,181
The collateral damage
will destroy the port.

581
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,061
Where are Bertinelli
and the Red Lions holed up?

582
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,729
Storage facility on 5th and Brockton.

583
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,151
We can take the port
without Bertinelli's say,

584
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,980
but there are
a lot of players in this city.

585
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,400
I think you should set a precedent
for when you're in charge.

586
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,911
I'm already in charge, Ms. Lance.

587
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,115
Even more reason
to use his corpse as a message.

588
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,619
I concur.

589
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,880
Mr. Bertinelli has his army.
He should meet ours.

590
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,634
- You think Bertinelli's gonna show?
- He better.

591
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,343
He will.

592
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,727
Let's get this over with.

593
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,604
If Keyhole satellite imagery
is anything to go off of,

594
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,026
it looks like
Cayden James took the bait.

595
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,447
Whoa!

596
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:38,868
Go, go!

597
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,704
Funny thing.

598
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,840
You guys don't look like
a Chechnyan death squad!

599
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,484
We have a Ricardo Diaz in the house,

600
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,440
but no Cayden James.

601
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,570
<i>I'll take it.</i>

602
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,697
Oh, no. We have a very large problem.

603
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,123
Oliver, get out of there.

604
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,747
Send in the cavalry.

605
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,800
So, how does this compare to <i>Halo?</i>

606
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,257
So much better.

607
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,403
Stand down, Oliver.

608
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,356
You're are vastly outnumbered.

609
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,243
Damn it.

610
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,974
That's it. Let's get the hell out
of this freak show.

611
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,396
All right. All right.

612
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,186
Don't leave early.

613
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,360
The best parts are always at the end.

614
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,820
I'm disappointed, Mr. Bertinelli.
I truly am.

615
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,371
But not unreasonable.

616
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,203
This can go one of two ways
for you and your men.

617
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,330
The choice is yours.

618
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,634
Forgive me, kid.

619
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,533
Mr. Bertinelli...

620
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,612
It's fine. Relax, all right?
Just take the freaking port.

621
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,117
Thank you.

622
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,743
Although you elected
to betray me this evening,

623
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,378
you ultimately made the right choice.

624
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,719
Which is why
I won't have your daughter killed.

625
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,185
I expect you can find the most
effective use for this corpse

626
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,762
to... How did you put it?

627
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,021
"Send a message."

628
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,441
Aren't you happy to be back

629
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,650
in your newly debugged
crime-fighting lair?

630
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,029
Cayden James got away.

631
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,742
Everybody got away.

632
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,285
Did you ever see that movie

633
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,536
<i>- BullDurham?</i>
- Hmm?

634
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,743
My mom made me watch that movie
all the time.

635
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,624
I mean, it is the best
baseball movie ever,

636
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:51,921
but she used to say

637
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,249
that Susan Sarandon
was her fictional life coach.

638
00:34:55,552 --> 00:35:00,468
There's a line in this movie
where she says,

639
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,641
"Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose,

640
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,510
"and sometimes it rains."

641
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,646
You can't control the weather.

642
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,564
You couldn't control
Bertinelli betraying you.

643
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,266
You know what else I can't control?

644
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,186
Their numbers advantage.

645
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,155
I can't be out there solo
against that group.

646
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,321
It's not the smart move.

647
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,736
I won't make that mistake again.

648
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,124
I just want to say that, I, for one,

649
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,750
think it's great that we're all
back in the same room together.

650
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,671
Trust and forgiveness.

651
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,506
For the past few weeks,
I have been really struggling

652
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,803
to square that circle.

653
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,757
I think all of us have.

654
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:48,056
Rene, as a father, I understand
why you did what you did.

655
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:53,979
I also recognize that you might be
taking me away from my son.

656
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,027
I reacted to that and I got angry.

657
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,029
The three of us decided

658
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,860
to put the three of you
under surveillance.

659
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,409
I take responsibility for that.

660
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,365
It was, without question...

661
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,959
It was a breach of trust.

662
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,879
So was lying to the team about Vince.

663
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,581
And I'm not trying
to point fingers, Dinah,

664
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,713
I am simply trying to illustrate

665
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,763
that there is blame
on all sides here.

666
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,100
But we don't have time for grudges
or recriminations. We don't.

667
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,018
Not with what the city is up against.

668
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,896
So? What do you guys think?

669
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,645
Clean slate?

670
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,986
Clean slate.

671
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,317
Things just go back
to the way they were before?

672
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,529
Yeah.

673
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,450
I don't think I can do that.

674
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,578
Not after what the three of you did.

675
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,577
This city needs us.

676
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:59,085
And we know that, and we're not
shirking that responsibility.

677
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,631
We decided to go our own way.

678
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,678
- Wait a minute.
- No, no. Let's...

679
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,096
No, no, no.

680
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,220
This is what Cayden James wants.

681
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,017
Cayden didn't do this, Felicity.

682
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,222
He didn't create
an environment of distrust.

683
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,849
A team where
some members of that team

684
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,026
were treated differently than others.

685
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,865
Cayden James didn't demand allegiance

686
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,866
and then play
by his own set of rules.

687
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:31,156
I came because I want
to be a part of a real team.

688
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,910
Point taken.

689
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,917
I'd like to
wish the three of you good luck.

690
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,830
And I mean that sincerely
with Cayden,

691
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,167
with Anatoly, Diaz,
Black Siren, Vigilante,

692
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,877
these people are dangerous.

693
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,056
So, whatever you have planned,
whatever your move is,

694
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,347
good luck.

695
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,304
Let's go, guys.

696
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,363
I may have solved
the glitch in my chip.

697
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,650
I hope it helps.

698
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:13,239
I, um, really do.

699
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,096
What the...

700
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,899
I hope you don't mind.

701
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,860
Found these in my personal collection

702
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,360
and thought that we could add them
to your album.

703
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,027
Oh, thank you very much.

704
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,443
- It's my apology.
- For what?

705
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,528
You were right.

706
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,832
Look, Malcolm was every bit
as bad as this Laurel is right now,

707
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:02,710
and then in the end, he wasn't.

708
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,294
He changed.

709
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,047
And Laurel can, too.

710
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,880
I had no right
to tell you that she couldn't.

711
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,467
Right.

712
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,387
How the hell am I gonna do that?

713
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,014
Well, I can help.

714
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,776
And... I don't know. Maybe together,

715
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,147
we can find a way
to break through to her.

716
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,902
Yeah.

717
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,533
When you said
you had something to show us,

718
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,739
didn't you think
lights would be useful?

719
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,244
One second, guys.

720
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,077
It is all about the reveal.

721
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,551
What does it look like?

722
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,048
Some place.

723
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,096
No, it's our new lair.

724
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,969
Helix used to operate out of here,

725
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,346
but it's not like
they're using it anymore, so.

726
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,599
Curtis, it's genius.

727
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,265
Seriously, nice work.

728
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,849
I'm glad you guys like it.

729
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,481
Now, I don't suggest
we make this a regular thing,

730
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,982
seeing as how
I'm a lightweight and all,

731
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:12,407
but this event warrants celebration.

732
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,828
Well, I am just glad that
I've found partners who I can trust.

733
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,281
That's what I'm talking about.

734
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,544
I'm concerned.

735
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,465
And the feeling doesn't suit me well.

736
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,926
You got the port like you wanted.

737
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,138
Sorry if I was unclear.
My concern relates to you.

738
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,604
Your continued association
with Ms. Drake wouldn't worry me

739
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:54,034
if this surveillance didn't suggest
that she knows about our association.

740
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,780
Don't worry.

741
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,736
I can handle Dinah.

742
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,454
There's not a button she has
I don't know how to push.

743
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,330
All right.

744
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,257
The new chip is in.

745
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,922
Just one second.

746
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,472
It doesn't feel any different.

747
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,060
It takes a minute.

748
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:33,939
Or not.

749
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:35,900
It worked?

750
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,117
Looks like we're not
as undermanned as we thought.

751
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,418
Yes.
