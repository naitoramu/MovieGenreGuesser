1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,538
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,790
These are innocent people.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,087
And you can save them...

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:10,042
By wiring 10 million dollars
into that account every night.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,546
$70 million.

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,674
<i>I'm going to make sure
Vince didn't die for nothing.</i>

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,181
I'm going to kill
every last one of them.

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,595
Starting with Laurel.

9
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,806
Laurel!

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,065
<i>There is a piece of my daughter
in you, somewhere.</i>

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,732
And I'm gonna get it out,
whatever it takes.

12
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,733
Thank you for all you've done
to get justice for my boy.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,035
The new police captain,
she's on my payroll.

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,368
Tell your boy I said hello.

15
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,506
Severed subclavian artery,
no defensive wounds.

16
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,341
How did this happen?

17
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,003
Sometime between transfer
and intake at Iron Heights,

18
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,339
an inmate caught James unaware.

19
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,639
By the time the guards intervened,

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,216
- it was too late.
- Motive?

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,347
The inmate was a headcase off his meds.

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,144
For all we know, he thought
he was killing his mother.

23
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,439
Well, the random murder
of Cayden James...

24
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,898
- It doesn't feel very random.
- It was bad timing,

25
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,821
and even worse luck, Mr. Mayor.
That's all.

26
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,032
All right.

27
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,318
Cayden James is my responsibility.

28
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,737
If a head has to roll for this,
make it mine.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,156
That is not how I run things here.

30
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,033
Just...

31
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,294
Keep doing what you're doing.

32
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,594
Please, please! One at a time!
One at a time!

33
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,971
Thank you.

34
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,803
I understand that you're angry.
I am... I'm angry, too.

35
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,601
But we're not going to solve any
problems by yelling at one another.

36
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,936
Last I heard, Cayden James is dead,

37
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,768
but you still don't have
the money he stole.

38
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,478
You mean the money he was given.

39
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,315
We are still in the process
of recovering the money

40
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,900
that was extorted from the city.

41
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,072
We just need a little more time.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,367
We are on the verge
of financial collapse.

43
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,744
Without an influx of cash, soon,
we all have to shut down.

44
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,502
Schools, sanitation,
emergency services, everything.

45
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:18,713
Fine. We will have those funds
back in 48 hours.

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,179
You have my word.
All of you have my word.

47
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,677
Thank you.

48
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,520
Okay...

49
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,687
Not that I don't love
your confidence and everything,

50
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,269
but should you really
be making promises like that?

51
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,566
The accountant is on his way back
from Corto Maltese

52
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,400
with the money that was deposited
into Cayden James' bank account

53
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,657
as we speak.

54
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,111
You could've just told them that,
got those folks off your back.

55
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,242
I'm not telling them anything concrete,

56
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,699
until that money is back
in the city's bank accounts.

57
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,961
My bigger concern right now
is finding Cayden's associates

58
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,752
before Dinah does,
because she is on the warpath.

59
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,133
- Yeah.
- Any luck with that?

60
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,007
John is working a few leads.
We should know more in a few hours.

61
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,010
Don't worry, they're not gonna
let anything happen to Laurel.

62
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,216
Oh, right.

63
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,641
<i>The accountant's here.</i>

64
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,259
Send him in.

65
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,892
All right, I'll take that as my cue.
I've got to head off to Planning.

66
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,392
Oh. Okay...
Welcome.

67
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,979
What are you doing here?

68
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,314
Well, he's carrying evidence.

69
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,276
I'm just making sure
it doesn't get up and walk away.

70
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,364
Good luck with that.

71
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,198
Wasn't planning
on seeing you today, Lieutenant.

72
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,910
Well, I wasn't planning on it either,
but we've got a problem.

73
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,004
Cayden James' Corto Maltese
bank account has been withdrawn.

74
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,590
What do you mean, "it's been withdrawn"?

75
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,464
It's empty. All 70 million.

76
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,088
Somebody took all the funds out
before we got access.

77
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,392
- Do we have any idea who?
- No. But I do have three guesses.

78
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,434
I put in a request
for the withdrawal log,

79
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,224
but it's a long shot.

80
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,899
If we don't have those funds
in 48 hours,

81
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,186
this city's government services
will shut down.

82
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,109
And I understand.

83
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,527
But banks in third-world countries
like Corto Maltese

84
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,324
aren't exactly known
for their transparency.

85
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,952
I'm very sorry, Mr. Mayor.

86
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,541
Something smells good.

87
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,619
Well, that smell is physics,

88
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,205
mathematics and chemistry hard at work.

89
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,295
Felicity is teaching me
about... "Thermodynamics"?

90
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,421
That's right.

91
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,548
- And we just really wanted cookies.
- Narc.

92
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,972
Don't you normally have tutoring
after school, bud?

93
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,514
We all got sent home.

94
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,308
Miss Joe said
it had to do with the budget.

95
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,640
Is it true they might have to
close the schools?

96
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,765
I'm working very hard
to make sure that doesn't happen.

97
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,609
There's actually something that I
needed to speak with Felicity about.

98
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,440
I'll keep working on the cookies.

99
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,400
Yeah, you definitely have
that "day from hell" look.

100
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,238
What's going on?

101
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,992
The money that Cayden
extorted from the city...

102
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,617
- Hmm.
- Someone emptied the account.

103
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,870
Yeah, well, that somebody is either
Anatoly, Diaz or Laurel.

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,667
Or another player
that we haven't seen yet.

105
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,580
We requested the withdrawal logs
from the bank.

106
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,165
It's Corto Maltese, taking too long.
You want me to help expedite it.

107
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,171
I need it to look like it's coming
through official channels.

108
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,503
Yeah, I know. It's not my first rodeo
with Corto Maltese.

109
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,589
Give me about an hour.

110
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,341
Hey, you don't think it's a coincidence?

111
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,516
Someone killing Cayden
right as the money goes missing?

112
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,893
Could be the same person that
framed you for Cayden's son's murder.

113
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,144
Could be.

114
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,184
The only thing
that I know for sure right now

115
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,860
is that if I don't get that money
in 48 hours,

116
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,030
this city is going to have my head.

117
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,449
Any luck finding Anatoly?

118
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,694
Just Bratva dudes
who don't know anything.

119
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,366
What about you guys?

120
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,081
Diaz's trail has gone colder
than my love life.

121
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,248
Same with Laurel.

122
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,668
If it's any consolation,
the other guys are striking out, too.

123
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,087
Ran into Digg chasing the same dead end.

124
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,584
I guess they're not sharing
their intel with us.

125
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,132
Not that we were sharing any with them.

126
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,301
Well, we can't trust them
to keep us looped in.

127
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,095
I mean, that's why I got put on
the Cayden James bank situation.

128
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,762
Any clue we get can lead us
to the scum who worked with them.

129
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,514
Scum singular or scum plural?

130
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,890
And yes, that is me bringing up

131
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,563
exactly what's going on
between you and Laurel.

132
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,265
Well, we're not
braiding each other's hair, Curtis.

133
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:05,523
I mean, but you are out for revenge,
and I don't feel too good about that.

134
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,451
Gotta go.

135
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,324
Looks like we got a lead
on the missing money.

136
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,172
You okay with this?

137
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,875
D hunting Laurel?

138
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,677
Let's just worry about the money first,

139
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,129
then we'll deal with Dinah.

140
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,218
You're not going to believe it.

141
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,847
The bank just sent over
the withdrawal log we requested,

142
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,802
plus security footage.

143
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,388
That is unbelievable.

144
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,723
What are we seeing?

145
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,352
The account was accessed by this woman.

146
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,979
<i>She's listed in the withdrawal log
as "Siu Jerg Jai."</i>

147
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,655
Took out the entire amount
in bearer bonds.

148
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,034
It's excellent work, Jay. Okay.
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

149
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,581
I'm guessing Felicity
had something to do with this.

150
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,912
Yeah, she did.

151
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,460
Thank you for inserting yourself
into this, by the way.

152
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,758
Yeah, sure. Well, you never would've
shared the information otherwise.

153
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,051
No, I wouldn't have.

154
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,844
Because I don't trust you
to do the right thing.

155
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,719
And what is that, politely ask Laurel
to give back the money?

156
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,015
Not kill her.

157
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,260
Dinah...

158
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,226
I understand that you're hurting.
I get it.

159
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,316
I also understand that
I don't have the most credibility

160
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,190
when it comes to telling people
not to commit murder.

161
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,356
But the city is on the verge
of economic collapse,

162
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,316
and we just found the key
to fixing that.

163
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,703
Laurel is never giving you that money.

164
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,622
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I actually do.

165
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,325
Because I know that
when you look at her,

166
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,919
you see the Laurel that you lost.

167
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,414
And that's why
you'll never be able to do

168
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,090
what's necessary to get that money back.

169
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,257
And you will?

170
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,295
Understand something.

171
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,845
I will never let you cross that line.

172
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,725
If you're going to threaten me, Oliver,

173
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,770
you better be damn sure you can deliver.

174
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,616
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

175
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,824
You'll pop your stitches.

176
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,664
How are you feeling?

177
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,875
Like I've been shot in the gut.

178
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,212
Where am I?

179
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,883
You're someplace nobody can find you.

180
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,980
I guess we now know
what happened to $70 million.

181
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,023
Right. If we find her, then we find it.

182
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,365
Quentin, I know that
we have been over this,

183
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,869
but just for accuracy, you were
the last person that saw her.

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,037
Yeah. Well, I...
You know, I didn't see her exactly.

185
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,538
- Right.
- Like I told you,

186
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,542
Dinah got off a shot just as Laurel
knocked us both out with her cry.

187
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,255
And, uh, yeah, when I came to,
Laurel was gone.

188
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,593
So, are we even sure that Dinah hit her?

189
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,093
No. She didn't leave a definitive
blood trail at the scene.

190
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,175
We can go back over it
with chemical analysis,

191
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,385
- see if we missed anything
- Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

192
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,889
Listen, actually there is
something I should tell you.

193
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,397
Um, while Cayden James
was holding the city hostage,

194
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,648
Laurel started following me.

195
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,151
All right? It was right after
James kidnapped me.

196
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,735
And so, uh, well, you know,
I caught up with her.

197
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,952
I tried to make a connection.

198
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,581
Well, I mean, after what we just
saw her do to Dinah's boyfriend...

199
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,538
Are we even sure that that worked?

200
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,164
Actually, it might have.

201
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,414
When we went through
her go-bag at the scene, there was...

202
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:56,177
There was a photo in there of you
and our Laurel.

203
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,886
I gave her that picture.

204
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,346
Anyway... My point
being, if she hasn't skipped town yet,

205
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,516
maybe she'll come try to find me,
make a connection, you know,

206
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,599
- say goodbye or something.
- I mean, it's a long shot, but...

207
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,560
I agree, but I also don't think
that we can afford to be picky, so...

208
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,815
I'll get home.

209
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,192
I'll make it easy for her to,
you know, get me alone.

210
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,070
If she shows up, just make sure
that you stall long enough

211
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,241
for John and I to get there.

212
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,861
Yeah, sure. Bye.

213
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,205
Well, do you need me
to go with you for backup?

214
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,784
No, no. You know, like I said
it's a long shot. Right?

215
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,504
So, your time is probably better
spent here at the office.

216
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,419
But thank you.

217
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,881
Okay, well, call if you need anything.

218
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,344
We've already been over this spot
a thousand times.

219
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,767
Yeah, which is exactly why
I brought my new toy.

220
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,394
Presenting...

221
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,557
Mr. Terrific's
Supersonic Spectrograph.

222
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,434
It uses Earth-2 sonic frequencies

223
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,646
emitted from Black Siren
and combines them with light imaging

224
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,526
to create a holographic replication

225
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,074
of her position
during that night's events.

226
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,828
- Is that...
- Laurel.

227
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,364
Is she crawling?

228
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,581
No. She was dragged.

229
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,716
Looks like she wasn't
putting up much of a fight.

230
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,965
- Your bullet must have tagged her, D.
- Good.

231
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,672
Now we just have to find her

232
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,472
before the others do something stupid.

233
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,883
Stupid how?

234
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,718
Oliver is not seeing clearly on this.

235
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,313
He's desperate to get that money.
He'll believe anything Laurel says.

236
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,515
Shouldn't we also
be desperate for that money?

237
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,688
- The city's hurting.
- I know.

238
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,899
But there are more effective ways

239
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,400
to find out
where she's keeping that money.

240
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,899
Sounds like
you're talking about torture.

241
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,326
And it sounds like
you wanna go soft on her.

242
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,822
Curtis, the only way
to get justice for Vince

243
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,871
and money for the city
is going to be messy.

244
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,868
Hey, guys, look at this.

245
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,494
Tire tracks.

246
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,170
If they're from whoever
dragged her off, could be something.

247
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,839
Let's make sure they didn't
leave anything else behind.

248
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,806
I picked this up at a noodle shop
my girls used to love.

249
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,771
I've never been to any noodle shop.

250
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,236
Well, hot and sour's
the best thing for healing

251
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,688
no matter what Earth you're from.

252
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,945
You know, I think I might have
a picture here of the three of us.

253
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,151
Would you stop?

254
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,864
I've already told you,

255
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,323
there's nothing inside of me
to change or going to change.

256
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,296
Um...

257
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,214
You know, you, uh...

258
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,500
You let me go.

259
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,174
Instead of killing me,
like James wanted.

260
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:50,218
You hesitated killing Vincent Sobel...

261
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,052
Before doing exactly that.

262
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,393
Yeah.

263
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,724
You've done
some pretty unspeakable things.

264
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,316
Do you ever stop to ask yourself why?

265
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,784
Huh?

266
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,247
Basically, you grew up without a father.

267
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,460
My guess, you spent your whole life
looking for one.

268
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,829
Zoom.

269
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,173
Adrian Chase.

270
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,921
Cayden James.

271
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,504
All those men are gone now.

272
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,548
Including Cayden James,
he was killed last night.

273
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,935
Well, it looks like I have an opening
for a new domineering father figure.

274
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,270
Feel free to send in your application.

275
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,985
You don't need anybody else telling
you what to do with your life.

276
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,147
Interesting.

277
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,567
Coming from someone
who has me locked up in a cabin

278
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,946
in the middle of nowhere.

279
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,744
You're welcome to leave anytime.

280
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,284
But, my, you know, my guess is that

281
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,995
it's been a long time

282
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,337
since you had a chance to decide
what you want your life to be.

283
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,220
So, I figured I'd give you
a little time and space

284
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,931
to do just that.

285
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,300
I've got my hopes for sure.

286
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,020
But you're the one
that has to want to change.

287
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,608
It's weird.

288
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,984
I actually really like
hot and sour soup.

289
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,784
Maybe we have more things in common
than I thought.

290
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,996
Would you tell me more
about your Laurel?

291
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,504
Well, the luminol's certainly
doing its work on this blood trail.

292
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,257
<i>Yeah, so much blood, we shouldn't
need the luminol to see it.</i>

293
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,921
Someone cleaned this place up.

294
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,348
Yeah, because Laurel
lost too much blood to do it herself.

295
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,051
What, so someone helped her get away?

296
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,726
No, someone took her.

297
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,566
I don't want to believe it, but I can.

298
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,777
We have to find her before
they do something irreversible.

299
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,695
If they haven't already.

300
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,657
- How has the print gotten us nowhere?
- We're not nowhere.

301
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,332
We've already ruled out
all the known vehicles

302
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,001
in the SCPD criminal database.

303
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,292
Which just leaves us with
millions of other unknown vehicles.

304
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,672
Otherwise, known as "nowhere."

305
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,505
Rene is right. This lead is exhausted.

306
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,637
What the hell?

307
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,428
Where is she?

308
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,851
We know you have Black Siren.

309
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,520
If she dies, you've destroyed the city!

310
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,643
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We do not have Black Siren.

311
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,099
We'll figure that out for ourselves.

312
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,809
Since when is our word not enough?

313
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,485
Since you tried to kill her.

314
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,324
If she dies, that money is lost forever.

315
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,325
"Lost forever." Like Vincent Sobel.

316
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,574
Where was the Green Arrow
when he needed saving?

317
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,909
Your team walked into a trap.

318
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,412
If you came with us,
Vincent might still be alive.

319
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,212
Don't you dare say his name.

320
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,586
Thermal imaging is only showing
our six heat signatures inside.

321
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,258
I mean, if Laurel's here, she's...

322
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,419
She's not warm.

323
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,971
Are you hacking us?
Don't hack us, Felicity!

324
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,014
I'm not hacking. I wouldn't hack...

325
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,636
Yeah, technically I'm hacking you.

326
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,847
- Wouldn't be your first time.
- No, it wouldn't.

327
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,190
She's tracked all of you before.

328
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,945
Because we needed to know
if one of you broke our trust.

329
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,613
One of you did.

330
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,527
You have already
punished Rene for that mistake.

331
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,823
It's just too bad he doesn't
look like Laurel Lance, Oliver,

332
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,871
because if he did, you would
probably forgive him for murder.

333
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,586
Guys, we're not actually about to
fight about this, are we?

334
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,004
Like, physically fight?

335
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,833
Keep your team in line, Curtis,
and we won't have to find out.

336
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,503
Hold on! You guys barged
into another's team bunker!

337
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,259
Curtis, just listen for once.

338
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,633
Hey, hey, hey, hey, guys, no.

339
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,886
I do think Oliver wants to fight.

340
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,021
'Cause that's how
you always solve your problems.

341
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,899
That doesn't make you a hero.

342
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,193
It makes you a thug.

343
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,238
And it's a real shame,

344
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,193
because he's gonna feel
so betrayed when he figures it out.

345
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,746
You know who I'm talking about,
don't you, Hoss?

346
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,536
William.

347
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,998
Don't turn your back on me!

348
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,711
- Hey!
- Don't move.

349
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,259
- So, you're gonna shoot us, Digg?
- Do it.

350
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,265
So, this was your plan all along, huh?

351
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,718
To get the chance
to look through our bunker?

352
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,271
And you wonder why we can't trust you.

353
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,603
We don't have
to wonder anymore.

354
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,855
Laurel's not here. Let's go.

355
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,239
Just so you know...

356
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,575
We are gonna find her!

357
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,204
And when we do, you better
hope to God you're not there too.

358
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,288
You think you know somebody,
then they do a triple-worm

359
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,169
blue cobalt IP hack that you taught them

360
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,249
right into your soul.

361
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,710
God, I can't believe
we even ever worked with them.

362
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,671
You say "with,"
but what you really mean is "for."

363
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,389
They never treated us
like we were equals.

364
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,137
Perimeter alarm's reset.

365
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,813
Also, I borrowed
a piece of your tech, Curtis.

366
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,433
What did you do?

367
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,518
You didn't really think
I wanted Oliver to hit me.

368
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,361
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?

369
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,856
I planted one of Curtis'
audio chips on Oliver.

370
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,780
So, if they get the drop on Laurel...

371
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,115
So will we.

372
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,783
Karma, bitch!

373
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,459
<i>...the thought of being
against our guys, you know.</i>

374
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,246
I hate to state
the oh, so depressingly obvious,

375
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:57,881
but since Dinah and company
don't have Laurel, we have nothing.

376
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,386
Nada, zilch, bupkis.

377
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,677
Not true. We have three former teammates

378
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,349
who hate us more now
than they did before.

379
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,853
Can't worry about them.
Guys, we're out of time here.

380
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,100
- Should I reach out to Lyla?
- I appreciate that, John,

381
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,432
but the last thing
that we need right now

382
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,233
is yet another group putting
Black Siren in their crosshairs.

383
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,856
Oh, square, meet one.

384
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,695
She didn't vanish
off the face of the Earth.

385
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,898
Are you sure? I mean, 'cause,

386
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,357
technically, she is from another Earth.

387
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,951
We're gonna find her.

388
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,821
Because we have to.

389
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,166
Quentin.

390
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,134
Thea, what are you doing here?
You followed me?

391
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,508
Yeah, well, I... I knew
you were lying about something.

392
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,056
But, I, I did not think it was this.

393
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,599
Okay, she's sleeping, please.

394
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,302
Okay, but why didn't
you tell me?

395
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,682
I thought we were in on this together.

396
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,685
I didn't wanna put you in a position
where you had to lie to Oliver, okay?

397
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,767
But listen, this is the right thing.

398
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,480
Okay...

399
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,979
I think I am getting through to her.

400
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,198
But you got to go
before she wakes up, please.

401
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,026
Okay, fine. But did you at least
find out where the money is?

402
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,614
Well, I'm building up to that.

403
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:11,708
Look, I know how important she
and this whole thing is to you.

404
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,205
I get it.

405
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,337
But the city is dying
without that money.

406
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,586
- We need to find it.
- Right, right, right.

407
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,338
And, you know, I'll ask her.

408
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,963
But she just can't feel like
she's being forced into something.

409
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,714
Okay, we are running out of time.

410
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,265
I got to call Ollie
and get him in on this.

411
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,725
Okay, I'm sorry,
but your brother's not exactly

412
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,222
known for his light touch, all right?

413
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,430
And you and I, we both know
that I'm the only person

414
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,139
with any chance
of getting through to her.

415
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,816
Well, that's so sweet
of you to think, Daddy.

416
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,856
But Thea's right.

417
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,279
You should probably call your BFF.

418
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,238
Thea, I'll be back to City Hall
as soon as I can be.

419
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,574
<i>Ollie, I'm not in the office.</i>

420
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,876
- Where are you?
<i>- With Quentin.</i>

421
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,749
<i>- And Laurel.</i>
- What?

422
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,006
Are you okay? Did she hurt you?

423
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,462
<i>No, I'm fine. Don't worry.</i>

424
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,589
She's too torn up to scream.

425
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,926
Quentin has been taking care of her
in a cabin.

426
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,840
It's really cool.
He's been hiding her up here.

427
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,802
Excuse me, it's a little
more complicated than that, okay?

428
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,728
No, Quentin, it's really not.

429
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,555
<i>Okay, let's cut the crap.</i>

430
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,732
I hear your city's on a clock.

431
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,808
Where's the money?

432
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,815
Don't worry, I'll tell you everything,

433
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,443
after you help me
get the hell out of this country.

434
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,986
No deal.

435
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,034
<i>The offer's not getting
any better, Ollie.</i>

436
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,204
And the only reason I'm even
considering handing over my nest egg

437
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,826
<i>is because I need help getting away</i>

438
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,284
<i>from that nasty little
songbird friend of yours.</i>

439
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,211
Fine.

440
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,920
Speedy, text me the address.

441
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,680
That was easier than expected.

442
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,427
Oliver's willing to burn Vince, but
he'll let that murdering bitch go.

443
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,594
You were right, D.

444
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,230
Oliver just took Laurel at her word.

445
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,770
The city's not getting
its money back that way.

446
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,568
It's up to us.

447
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,440
Can you track the bug?

448
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,446
You know I can.

449
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,240
Then let's suit up.

450
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,990
Six miles out. Head west.

451
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,622
Felicity, you might wanna make sure
your seat belt is on.

452
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,173
Yeah. It looks good.

453
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,171
- Why?
- We got a tail.

454
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,637
We're marked!

455
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:44,986
Oh!

456
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,071
- You think it's the others?
- Has to be.

457
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,318
How did they find us?

458
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,115
- Oh, my...
- What?

459
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:55,948
This.

460
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,703
Rene wanted me to hit him.

461
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,333
It doesn't matter now,
they're in our dust.

462
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,505
Can you keep them there?

463
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,167
You forgot what you hired me for
six years ago.

464
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,718
You know,
that was exhilarating.

465
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,880
It was Alanis Morissette-level ironic.

466
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,297
But exhilarating.

467
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:29,989
Hello, Ollie.

468
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,275
Where's the money?

469
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,576
Haven't we gone
through this already?

470
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,909
No money until
I am safely out of this country.

471
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,165
You are in no position to make demands.

472
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,626
I can think of 70 million different
reasons why you're wrong about that.

473
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,830
Okay.

474
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,170
Oliver, Oliver, please, please.

475
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,260
Listen, Dinah's just got her scared,
all right? And for good...

476
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,841
Good reason.

477
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,097
Laurel needs our protection.

478
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,098
Which is why
you should let me go with you.

479
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,684
I'll make sure you get
out of the country safely,

480
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,560
and then we can start your new life.

481
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,734
- Together.
- Quentin, that's insane.

482
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,652
Well, well, well...

483
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,488
That was quite the performance,

484
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,317
but now that I know that it was
only about the money, hard pass.

485
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,527
Actually, Thea had it right earlier.

486
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,035
I was more focused on getting
through to you than the money.

487
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,411
But I believe

488
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,874
that if you'd had someone
in your world to support you

489
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,788
when things got bad,

490
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,124
you wouldn't be a criminal.

491
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,256
This is our chance
to find out if I'm right.

492
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,258
If after a while you decide
that you don't want me there,

493
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,597
I'll leave.

494
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,886
Promise.

495
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,980
This time around,
everything's down to you.

496
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,480
Pack your sunblock.

497
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,819
I've always wanted to live
somewhere tropical.

498
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,113
Quentin.

499
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,870
The minute
that she is out of the country,

500
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,414
you get added to
the list of people she's killed.

501
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,585
I'm betting otherwise.

502
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,041
And you trust her enough

503
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,547
to risk yourself? To risk the city?
Tell me now.

504
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,223
I do.

505
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,973
Then so do I.

506
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:35,198
That's it. I am not sitting here
on the side of the road like trash

507
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,534
while they let that murderer go free!

508
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,155
Guys, we're gonna find them.

509
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,785
How? They tossed away our bug
like it was a bug.

510
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,411
I think I know a way.

511
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,209
But it's gonna hurt John.

512
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,912
You say that like it's a deal breaker.

513
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,376
That guy's the whole reason
I got shot, hoss.

514
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,584
Curtis, this is not the time
to be worrying about John's feelings.

515
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,720
No, I mean, really hurt John.

516
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,722
Physically.

517
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,551
Find them.

518
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,639
Whatever it takes.

519
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,648
Well, the union rep's deadline
is coming up soon.

520
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,647
Three-and-a-half hours
to be depressingly exact.

521
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,773
Don't worry. We'll be gone

522
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,855
and the money will be back
in the city coffers by then.

523
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,155
It better be.

524
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,282
Your new cover identities
are almost done.

525
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,318
You have a one-way ticket
on a private plane

526
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,529
to your father-daughter trip
of a lifetime.

527
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,832
Just keep that vengeful bird of yours
from finding me.

528
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,040
John? It's his arm.

529
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,580
The implant, it's been disabled.

530
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,505
Someone's hacking it remotely
to broadcast our location.

531
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,209
It's not "someone." It's Curtis.
They know where we are.

532
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,340
- Can you fix John?
- Rebooting the chip now.

533
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,881
It's gonna be a while
before you have full functionality.

534
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,387
You're going to be dealing with
your post-injury symptoms for a bit.

535
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,476
I'm aware.

536
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,895
- How long do we have?
- Based on the amount of time

537
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,189
that's passed since we last lost them
and now that they've attacked John,

538
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,390
not long.

539
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,023
I'm sorry, but with the other team
that angry, that close,

540
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,604
I can't protect Laurel by myself.

541
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,687
You don't have to.

542
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,398
Wait, are you gonna fight your old team?

543
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,482
This is insane.

544
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,661
Let's get ready to move.

545
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,618
You're gonna turn right in a mile,
dirt road.

546
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,832
You got us back on track, Mr. T.

547
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,039
I pity those fools now.

548
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,669
Do they know that
we know where they are?

549
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,500
Trust me, they know.

550
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,754
Here's the turn.

551
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,140
Listen...

552
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,010
Laurel is a meta.

553
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,055
Now, I know that people
protecting her were our friends,

554
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,774
but if you hold back, if any of us
hold back our punches here,

555
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,523
we are the ones who are gonna get hurt.

556
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,448
And Laurel and the city's money
will both be gone. Understood?

557
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,282
Sonic dampener arrow.

558
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,531
Never thought Dinah would be the one
we'd use that against...

559
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,866
Having second thoughts?

560
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,872
Best-case scenario, man.

561
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,542
Laurel avoids punishment
for what she's done.

562
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,419
We put a hurtin' on the people
who used to be our friends.

563
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,091
But we keep the city from dying.

564
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,510
But at what cost?

565
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,050
If the people going after her

566
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,598
didn't look like Curtis,
Dinah, and Rene,

567
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,972
would you even be asking this question?

568
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,394
No.

569
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,148
But I can't help but wonder,

570
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,809
would we be doing this

571
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,611
if the person they were after
didn't look like Laurel?

572
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,698
Listen, man, I would back any call
you make, Oliver.

573
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,658
Always have, always will.

574
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,495
But we should acknowledge the fact

575
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,375
that going after our former teammates
may be a line we can never uncross.

576
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,585
I agree.

577
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,997
But they crossed it first.

578
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,382
Take the other car
to the main road and don't turn back.

579
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,925
We'll stop the other team
from following.

580
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,511
You'll have the city's money
in two hours. I promise.

581
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,684
Thank you for fighting for me.

582
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,683
I'm not doing this for you.

583
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,894
But when it's over,

584
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,483
I don't wanna hear your name,

585
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,241
or see your face ever again.

586
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,194
Why not let me handle that?

587
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,532
You know, it's a shame you can't scream.

588
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,912
It almost makes this too easy.

589
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,211
Oh, sweetie,
I don't have to scream to kill you.

590
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,956
You are unbelievable.

591
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,418
I cannot believe you did that.
You could've seriously hurt John!

592
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,344
Just like you guys
are really gonna hurt the city

593
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,591
if you let her go!

594
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,844
Nothing's happened that can't be undone.

595
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,517
We're not saying it's a perfect
outcome, or even a good one,

596
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,935
but at least the city gets its money.

597
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,058
- That's not justice, hoss.
- That's enough.

598
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,440
We've debated this already.

599
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,521
We know where you stand.

600
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,978
- It's time to finish this right now!
- Dinah.

601
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,772
Not one more step.

602
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,673
Get to the car!

603
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,971
Rene!

604
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,313
You're wasting arrows.

605
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,731
Am I?

606
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,535
Hey, hey! Stop!

607
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,079
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, I must be. Yeah.

608
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,749
- Run!
- All right. Go! Go, go, go!

609
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,380
Go help Curtis.

610
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,631
It's all right. We'll get there.
It'll be fine.

611
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,053
It's all right.

612
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,922
Laurel.

613
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,849
Laurel. Come on, we got to go.
We got to go.

614
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,222
- Come on.
- Quentin.

615
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,302
Quentin.

616
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,144
You stay behind me.

617
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,069
Dinah, you can't do this.

618
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,572
Get out of my way.

619
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,232
You can't do this. Please don't.

620
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,783
Dinah...

621
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,647
Last chance, Rene!

622
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,440
- Stay down!
- No way!

623
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,866
- Hey, is everyone okay?
- We'll live.

624
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,368
- Can you manage?
- Yeah.

625
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,702
We can cut him off. Let's go.

626
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,611
Is this what you felt like

627
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,446
right before you killed Vince?

628
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,608
I'm sorry.

629
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,196
I'm sorry!

630
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,528
I'm sorry.

631
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,240
We are way, way past sorry.

632
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,041
Dinah!

633
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,457
If we lose her,

634
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,339
we lose the money,
but even if we had the money...

635
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,716
- You can't do this.
- Oh, God!

636
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,467
I have to, Curtis.

637
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,348
You know I have to.

638
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,768
I have to get justice for Vince.

639
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,437
Dinah, look around.

640
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,226
Look at what we're doing to each other.

641
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,649
Does this look like justice?

642
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,817
It's nobody's fault but theirs.

643
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,897
Then you sound just like Oliver.

644
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,237
We formed this team so we wouldn't
be like that. Like him.

645
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,867
Dinah, I don't wanna start today.

646
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,347
I will not be put

647
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,053
back in that cage!

648
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,022
- I'm sorry.
- We could still catch her.

649
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,195
No. You can't.

650
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,403
No more advantages.

651
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,196
I don't need them.

652
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,077
You still hurting?

653
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,166
Don't get soft now, Curtis.

654
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,830
We're just getting... Getting started.

655
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,708
Rene!

656
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,886
Quentin! You okay?

657
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,306
- What the hell's happening?
- We need to get to a hospital.

658
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,932
Now!

659
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,735
Any sign of Laurel?

660
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,573
That trail has gone cold.

661
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,495
I don't think that she'll be able
to get very far with her injuries.

662
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,914
What about yours?

663
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,291
Nothing Felicity can't fix.

664
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,873
You know, I still can't believe
Curtis did this.

665
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,501
I mean, messing with a chip in your
arm is totally crossing the line.

666
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,257
It's our company's prototype.

667
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,178
Obviously, injuring you
is way more of crossing of the line.

668
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,217
Way more.

669
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,099
Was not like
we didn't hurt them back.

670
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,398
Has anyone heard about Rene?
I mean, he...

671
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,441
He didn't look so good.

672
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,314
He was shot five months ago.
The wound reopened.

673
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,611
Well, we should go to the hospital.

674
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:17,984
We gotta make sure he's okay.

675
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:22,193
Unless anyone here has $70 million,
there won't be a hospital soon.

676
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,495
Well, listen, Laurel is gonna call,
all right? She's gonna call.

677
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,822
No, she's not.

678
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,660
I know how much we all wish

679
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,088
she was more like the Laurel
that we lost.

680
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,126
But she's not.

681
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,346
We should get ready
to talk to the press.

682
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,975
Quentin's right.
We should go and check on Rene.

683
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,399
Please tell him that I'm sorry.

684
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,570
- I screwed up, Thea.
- No, Quentin. You...

685
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,195
You just believed in your daughter,
okay? That's not screwing up.

686
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,411
And she is your daughter.

687
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,538
In the only way that really matters.

688
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,077
Yeah?

689
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,379
And what way is that?

690
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,207
In the eyes of her father.

691
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,144
Any update?

692
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,474
Yeah.

693
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,230
My bloodstream is about to
reach 90% coffee saturation.

694
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,862
You know, I said that joke
hoping that you would laugh, but...

695
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,413
Maybe now is not the best time
to be saying jokes, so I'll just...

696
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,541
No updates on Rene.

697
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,412
They've been working on him
for hours, huh?

698
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,081
Yeah.

699
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,249
But you know,

700
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,877
Rene is the definition of stubbornness.

701
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:07,097
No way is he gonna let Oliver
be the reason he goes down.

702
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,641
Yeah.

703
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,099
Dinah.

704
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,269
This whole Laurel thing...

705
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,847
It's not over.

706
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,312
The second Rene is in the clear,

707
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,738
we're gonna track her down,
and we are going to arrest her.

708
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,360
We will get justice for Vince.

709
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,116
Thank you for saying that.

710
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,740
If it wasn't for you,

711
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,292
I would have repaid Vince's death
with more violence.

712
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,958
That isn't justice.

713
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,002
I'm... I'm grateful to you,

714
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,297
you know,
just for pulling me back, so...

715
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,141
The speech worked
because I have faith in you, Dinah.

716
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,476
I also had my T-Spheres programmed
as a plan B.

717
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,401
City reps are all waiting,

718
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,859
and they don't know about the money
or lack thereof.

719
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,488
You don't need to be here, you know.

720
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,912
If you're facing the firing squad,
I'm standing by your side.

721
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,245
I don't know what to tell them.

722
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,249
- It's not your fault, Ollie.
- I'm the Mayor, Speedy.

723
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,420
I made a vow to protect Star City.

724
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,465
And I'm sorry, but I didn't.
I couldn't...

725
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,427
I swear that
I will make it up to them, but...

726
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,140
Just that, okay, Ollie?

727
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,055
You just tell them that.

728
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,189
I think we've waited long enough.

729
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,910
I need to...

730
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,990
I need to inform everyone
that the money

731
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,201
extorted from us
by the cyberterrorist, Cayden James,

732
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,410
has not been recovered.

733
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,922
And to be honest with you,
I don't know that it ever will be.

734
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,760
Now, I promised everyone that

735
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,970
I would find the funds

736
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,470
to keep the metro area running
without work stoppages, but...

737
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,137
I'm so very sorry. As Mayor, I...

738
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,729
I have failed this city.

739
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,482
<i>Now I know that your faith in me
is likely shaken, but my faith...</i>

740
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,692
<i>My faith in the citizens of Star City...</i>

741
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,322
Mayor's luck just keeps getting worse.

742
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,620
DA Armand.

743
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,034
You got a sec?

744
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,325
My case against Queen is built on sand.

745
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,919
It's only a matter of time before
Jean Loring figures that out.

746
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,621
And why are you telling me that?

747
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,627
I found something that could bury Queen.

748
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,926
But I'll need the full backstop.

749
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,212
All the SCPD's resources.

750
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,218
I can see why Mr. Diaz likes you.

751
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,431
The news isn't good.

752
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,183
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

753
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,561
We were able to stop
the bleeding in his chest,

754
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,816
but the injury also caused
his lung to re-collapse.

755
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,029
Now, given the severity
of your friend's injuries,

756
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,030
I'm recommending
he be transferred to a facility

757
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,702
that can provide the care he needs.

758
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,029
Outside of Star City.

759
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,745
Mr. Ramirez is resting now.

760
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,792
You and your friends
will have to wait to see him.

761
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,503
What friends?

762
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,421
We thought Rene would be here.

763
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,918
Well, of course he's here.
You saw what Oliver did to him.

764
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,382
Yeah. Yeah. How's Rene doing?

765
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,840
You've lost the right
to ask that question.

766
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,051
- You two need to leave.
- No.

767
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,470
No, not until you tell us
if Rene is okay. This is...

768
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,021
Stop it.

769
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,062
Don't you guys get it?

770
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,944
We're not just done fighting you,

771
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,443
we're done with
the three of you, period.

772
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,191
No more cooperation,

773
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,362
no more communication, forever.

774
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,366
Let's go.

775
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,457
Fine.

776
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,103
I don't know what day it is.

777
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,943
I gotta go...

778
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,616
- Are you okay?
- I just escaped. I...

779
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,656
I was kidnapped two year...
Two years ago, I think. I...

780
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,240
I don't know, I...

781
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,125
Lady, what's your name?

782
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,840
Laurel.

783
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,503
Laurel Lance.
