1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,640
Tokyo is back!

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,960
Tokyo is back!

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,000
On the ground!
Everyone on the ground!

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,200
We have to open the door, dammit!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,440
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,560
<i>Attention, fire.</i>

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,080
Let's go!

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,280
No! We have to cover her, dammit!

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,120
<i>Kidnapper in range, fire.</i>

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,840
Papa, look out!

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,400
<i>Take cover! Behind you!</i>

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
<i>This is fucking crazy.</i>

13
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,600
What is?

14
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,320
All of this, papa.

15
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>It'll work out this time,</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

16
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
<i>This time?</i>

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
It has to work out.

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
-We deserve it, right?
-Of course we do.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Help, help!

20
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Please!

21
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
The first aid kit!

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,160
The fucking first aid kit!

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
Cover the wound!

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
Look at me.

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,640
Easy.

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,880
It's a scratch on the side,
that's all.

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
On his side.

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,600
There's no exit hole.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,080
The bullet's inside.

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,240
Nairobi!

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,840
-I'm here!
-For fuck's sake.

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,200
He's bleeding out.

33
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Don't worry, son.

34
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,760
I've got loads of blood.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,280
I've eaten lots of blood sausage.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,640
Okay, hold him in place.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,040
Berlin,

38
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,320
-morphine.
-Relax.

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
-Here we go. Okay.
-Ready!

40
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm starting a line for him.

41
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,280
Okay,

42
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,760
-Here.
-Let me, let me.

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,840
Come on, come on.

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
Pull this, Denver.

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
Wait, wait!

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm starting a line for him.

47
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,560
Breathe slowly.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,440
Breathe slower.

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
-His pulse is shooting up.
-Gauze!

50
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
That's it.

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
Relax, Moscow.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
Moscow, relax.

53
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,200
Listen,
you're going to be okay.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Right? You'll be okay.

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
-Yes.
-Right?

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,480
It's okay, Moscow.

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,440
It's okay, Moscow.

58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Relax.

59
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Relax.

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,840
They put three bullets in him, Rio.

61
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,600
Three bullets.

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,840
TUESDAY 07:35 PM

63
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,280
HOUR 105 OF THE HEIST

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
-Son of a bitch.
-Raquel.

65
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
I broke free.

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,920
I could have escaped.

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,480
I could have killed you, Raquel.

68
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,920
You didn't believe that polygraph either.

69
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,920
Look,
this proves that I'm telling the truth.

70
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,080
You just fucked up
with this act of love,

71
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
because
I'm putting you away for 80 years.

72
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,600
Get up.

73
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,240
Slowly.

74
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,680
Hands on your head and turn around.

75
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,520
Don't move...
What the hell are you doing?

76
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
Don't move. Don't move!

77
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,320
I said don't move!

78
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,960
Hands on your head!

79
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
Not a single step more.

80
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Raquel, I'm not stopping.

81
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,120
You're going to have to kill me.

82
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,480
Fuck!

83
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,160
Son of a bitch, my phone!

84
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,120
Three bullets!

85
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
They put three bullets in his
stomach!

86
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,920
We must call a doctor.

87
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,720
There's nothing we can do.

88
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
It's time to keep a cool head,
Tokyo.

89
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm not just thinking about Moscow.

90
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,600
-I'm going to call the Professor.
-The Professor is gone!

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,240
I've called many times.
He's not in the hangar.

92
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,760
I don't know where he is!

93
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,680
-We must call Inspector Murillo.
-We can't do it!

94
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,520
You know.
It's not part of the plan.

95
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,520
What plan?

96
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,120
You know what my plan was?

97
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,760
To kill you.

98
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
But Moscow is the one dying.

99
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,480
So don't tell me what's not
part of the fucking plan.

100
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,080
This is Colonel Prieto speaking.

101
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,040
<i>I'd like to speak</i>
<i>with Inspector Murillo, please.</i>

102
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,600
The CNI has taken charge.

103
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Colonel,

104
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,480
It's Fonollosa.

105
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,040
I'd like to ask
what you're wearing

106
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,720
but no time for chit-chat,

107
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,960
since you just put three bullets
in our man.

108
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,600
I want a surgeon in here.

109
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,880
Now.

110
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,520
<i>Do you know what I want?</i>

111
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,800
For you to stop fucking with me.

112
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,520
You pulled Silene Oliveira
out of a police van

113
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,240
and got her back in the mint.

114
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,120
<i>You placed explosive devices that,</i>
<i>thank God,</i>

115
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
<i>didn't work.</i>

116
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,520
<i>Do you really think can make requests?</i>

117
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,480
Look,
it was a clean rescue on our part.

118
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,680
You guys started shooting.

119
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,840
<i>It would be nice of you</i>
<i>to help save this man's life.</i>

120
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,280
Listen carefully.

121
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,560
If you want to save him,
bring him through the main door, unarmed,

122
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,960
<i>and an ambulance will be waiting for him.</i>

123
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,760
We're not turning our man in,
Colonel.

124
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,920
<i>Then you'll have another corpse</i>
<i>on your hands.</i>

125
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
Have you tracked down the inspector?

126
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,520
We're working on it.

127
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,400
SAN GABRIEL HILLS 12 LOT SPECIAL
DARE TO DREAM OF YOUR NEW LIFE

128
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,200
Helsinki,

129
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
how does it look?

130
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,160
It's not a shot in the leg.

131
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,200
The stomach is a bad area,
Moscow.

132
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
Very bad.

133
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,960
We need a surgeon.

134
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,000
Honestly,

135
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,360
how much time do we have?

136
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
Hours.

137
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,080
Eleven.

138
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
Twelve, thirteen.

139
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,960
Without a surgeon
there's nothing we can do.

140
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,960
How many times was I hit?

141
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,880
Three, Papa.

142
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,360
Three times.

143
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Some mess I've got down there.

144
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,000
Moscow,

145
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
-What?
-They won't send in a surgical team.

146
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,840
But we have an ambulance out there
to take you to the hospital.

147
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,200
You can tell them
that they can go fuck themselves,

148
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
because I'm not going back to jail.

149
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,560
That hole

150
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,120
it's almost finished

151
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,920
to get to the other side.

152
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,480
That's ten hours of work.

153
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,800
Get digging.

154
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,360
I'll hang in here, okay?

155
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,040
Hang in there, Papa.

156
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,080
I'll open that tunnel
even if I have to headbutt my way through.

157
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,080
People,

158
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
we're getting out of here.

159
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,120
<i>There was a shootout. What happened?</i>

160
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,520
Moscow is full of holes.

161
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,360
<i>Three gunshots.</i>

162
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
Where?

163
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
<i>In the stomach.</i>

164
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
<i>I don't think they hit his liver.</i>

165
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,880
<i>I don't know about the rest.</i>

166
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,360
How is it looking?

167
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,400
Fucked.

168
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,560
But Moscow says he won't go out.

169
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,520
That we can finish the tunnel soon.

170
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,480
I have the Serbs here.

171
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,000
We're going to start digging
from this side too.

172
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,480
And I'll find the Ukrainian doctor.

173
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,800
Anyway you have to get out
as soon as possible.

174
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
I've been discovered, Andres.

175
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,040
<i>I don't know how long before the</i>
<i>police show up.</i>

176
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
Any news?

177
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,280
What's the matter?

178
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,360
What's he doing here?

179
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,760
Someone will tell me what is going on?

180
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,400
Did you know Sergio Marquina,
the Professor, is Salva?

181
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,040
The mastermind of the heist.

182
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,600
The man you've been seeing
at the bar for five days.

183
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,160
Yes.

184
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
I found out a few hours ago.

185
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
You got a call from that man.

186
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,160
He called
from the station in Canillas,

187
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,440
where he was in custody.

188
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,960
Minutes later you arrived.

189
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
You made a scene
to get him out of there,

190
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,000
and destroyed his fingerprints.

191
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,640
I didn't know who he was.

192
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,800
The evidence you destroyed

193
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,080
identified him
breaking into the police car

194
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,160
to threaten the Russian
in order to avoid the facial composite.

195
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,960
The man who erased the fingerprints

196
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,840
on the car found in the junkyard

197
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,440
from which Angel took a teaspoon
that proved him guilty

198
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,960
before having a fatal accident.

199
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,800
You took him
to the gang's house in Toledo, right?

200
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,080
You put him in my car,

201
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,920
where I kept the only legal evidence
I found in the house.

202
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,080
The paper from the fireplace
and the evidence disappeared.

203
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Apparently after leaving
Inspector Vicuña unconscious,

204
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
and when Angel did his job
and reported his suspicions,

205
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,840
you dropped him
from the investigation.

206
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,440
And to top it off,
while destroying your partner,

207
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,600
you were screwing
the leader of the gang.

208
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,160
Fine.

209
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,600
Fine.

210
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,720
First of all,

211
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,840
that man can't be here.

212
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,760
He has a restraining order.

213
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,240
So if he's not 500 feet away from me
in five minutes,

214
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,840
I'll have him arrested.

215
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,840
I didn't know who he was.

216
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,120
And I'll prove it.

217
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,800
I can tell you where he's hiding.

218
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,520
TUESDAY 10:15 PM

219
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,000
THREE HOURS SINCE THE SHOOTOUT

220
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,280
<i>What the fuck did you do?</i>

221
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,880
You left my mother at a roundabout?

222
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,920
You had me believe she was a bitch.

223
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,520
It was her or us.

224
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,840
<i>I won't break your skull</i>

225
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,640
<i>because we need you to get out.</i>

226
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,240
When we get out,

227
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
you and I are nothing.

228
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,920
Two strangers,

229
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Denver

230
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,000
and Moscow.

231
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,960
Fuck!

232
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,840
Can anyone tell me
what the fuck this is?

233
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,000
Please,

234
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
not like that.

235
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
We said little rolls
of a million each, please.

236
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,960
Max it out, dammit.

237
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,320
We'll keep printing bills
for a few more hours.

238
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,040
Then stop the machines and erase the logs.

239
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,000
I want everybody working to the max!

240
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,560
We're getting out of here!

241
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,080
That's right.

242
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,880
I've been told of another very good place

243
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
at the Federal Reserve.

244
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,240
Come here a minute.

245
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
How's Moscow?

246
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,880
He's stable.

247
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,560
We still have a few hours,
don't we?

248
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,480
Should we start making 500 euro bills?

249
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,400
The 500 euro bills are
for Russians and tacky people.

250
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,280
I'm not Russian. Do I look tacky?

251
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,680
My tastes might be questionable but...

252
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,880
Berlin, are we printing them or not?

253
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
100 and 200 euro bills.

254
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,520
Torres!

255
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,880
Torres,

256
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
stop the machines,

257
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,360
change the plates,

258
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,960
and start making 100 and 200 bills.

259
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,160
Yes, ma'am.

260
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
You like to jump puddles
from one stone to another

261
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,160
and every time you step a stone sinks.

262
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,040
<i>You're leaving dead bodies</i>
<i>by the roadside.</i>

263
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,360
Was it your idea or your boyfriend's
to rob the armored car?

264
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,160
Well, now your boyfriend is dead

265
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,360
and so is your mother.

266
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm sure you knew the pain
you were causing your mother.

267
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,520
I thought I'd never see you again.

268
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,320
What's the matter?

269
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,280
He told me.

270
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,040
I leave dead bodies behind
wherever I go.

271
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
Berlin kicked me out
and I came back.

272
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,400
And I've put everyone's lives in
danger.

273
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
I just had to come back, didn't I?

274
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,680
And now the dead body is Moscow.

275
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,640
Moscow isn't a dead body, okay?

276
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,520
He'll make it.

277
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,200
and we'll get out of here together.

278
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,440
I'm a black cat
that curses the people it crosses.

279
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,360
No.

280
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,360
You're a black panther,

281
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,120
my black panther.

282
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
How are you?

283
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,800
Right now I'm fucking great.

284
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,240
You have no fucking idea
how much I love you.

285
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,560
No fucking idea.

286
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,240
I love you too.

287
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,800
I have missed you.

288
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,600
Let's start getting the money out of here.

289
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,560
Come on, come on!

290
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,920
The ones in other room, too!

291
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,960
Ariadna, Ariadna.

292
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,240
Not you.

293
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,440
Come.

294
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,600
Put that down.

295
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Denver.

296
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,320
Denver!

297
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,320
Listen,

298
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,760
Denver, you have to stop.

299
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,360
-It's pointless.
-What?

300
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,240
Put the pick down

301
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
and convince your father
to turn himself in.

302
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,440
He has to get to a hospital.
He can't wait.

303
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,040
This tunnel is the only way
out and I'm leaving with my father.

304
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,400
You know why?

305
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,280
Why?

306
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,520
Because when we get out of here

307
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
you won't be wearing
a red jumpsuit anymore.

308
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,720
You'll be dressed in white,

309
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,800
gorgeous.

310
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,320
And I'll be waiting at the altar.

311
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,880
And I need him to be there by my side,

312
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,160
and to see it.

313
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,640
For him to grab me by the shoulder
and get goosebumps, okay?

314
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,920
I'm not stopping.

315
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,520
I'm not stopping.

316
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
So, shall we do this?

317
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,520
Let's do this!

318
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,240
-Let's do it!
-Let's go.

319
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,720
Just a bit more!

320
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,200
-Just a little more, dammit!
-Just a bit, Rio!

321
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,240
Less than two meters!

322
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,960
Have you thought about my proposal?

323
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,520
A short but passionate love story

324
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
in a tropical country.

325
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,280
And a proper inheritance.

326
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
Eight hundred million euros
that go to you.

327
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,960
That's the least important part,
Berlin.

328
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,760
I like the idea of going away with you

329
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,480
but it makes me sad because

330
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,840
you're going to die.

331
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,080
You'll make a gorgeous widow.

332
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,920
We have to get married.

333
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,320
Right, Ariadna?

334
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
I've never done it

335
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
dressed in white

336
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,480
at night.

337
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,080
How about on a beach,

338
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,960
under the stars, in a wild ritual
with lots of light,

339
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
and lots of fire.

340
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Beautiful.

341
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,240
Would you marry me, Ariadna?

342
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm sure some people think
that living with a dying man

343
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,160
is boring and

344
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,440
they're wrong.

345
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,440
It's the opposite.

346
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,480
It's going all in.

347
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,200
Driving without the safety belt on.

348
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,560
Riding a motorcycle without a
helmet.

349
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,720
Scuba diving without an oxygen tank.

350
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,960
Letting go of the reins for good,
no limits.

351
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,760
What about babies?

352
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,320
What do you think? Some mini Berlins
running along the beach.

353
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,320
Just kidding.

354
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,200
So the address you gave us
is where Mr. Marquina

355
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,360
supposedly set up his operations center.

356
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
In that cider bar, right?

357
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,640
Yes.

358
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,080
What's this?

359
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,520
It's a warehouse.

360
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,400
There's nothing in there.

361
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,120
A beat-up car, junk.

362
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,080
But no sign of an operations center.

363
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,400
Are you sure about the address
you gave us?

364
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,600
Of course I am.

365
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,160
I was there.

366
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,440
What were you doing there?

367
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,440
Making love.

368
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,240
<i>Our first rule was no names,</i>

369
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,040
<i>no personal relationships.</i>

370
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,880
<i>The Professor had envisioned</i>
<i>a heist with no attachments,</i>

371
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,960
<i>but when I saw him there,</i>

372
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,960
<i>smiling at me,</i>

373
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,760
<i>I realized that he was</i>
<i>the closest thing to a father</i>

374
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,280
<i>that I had ever had.</i>

375
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,360
What's so funny,

376
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,760
big guy?

377
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,880
Your bright ideas.

378
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,560
Escaping

379
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,720
just to come back to the factory.

380
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,120
You know it.

381
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,640
Dressed like a cop and everything.

382
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,000
Like James Bond.

383
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,400
That must have really pissed them.

384
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,240
He's shaking.

385
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,680
Moscow. Hey.

386
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,160
He's white as the snow in Stalingrad.

387
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,760
He's got a pulse of 35.

388
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
He needs a transfusion.
Get the plasma.

389
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,600
-Moscow.
-Come on.

390
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,200
O-negative.

391
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,440
Hey.

392
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
-Over here.
-Moscow.

393
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,560
There we go, you're with us.

394
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,800
It's okay. Are you okay?

395
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,640
It's okay, you're with us.

396
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,360
You're right here with us, okay?

397
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,240
WEDNESDAY 07:02 AM

398
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,120
11 HOURS SINCE THE SHOOTOUT

399
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
How's the tunnel going?

400
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,520
We're really close.

401
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,920
Hey, dear.

402
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,960
Girl.

403
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,240
Why don't you get some rest?

404
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,720
-Alright?
-Alright.

405
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,240
Let's go.

406
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,640
Here you go, keep working.

407
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Inspector.

408
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm afraid she can't answer the phone.

409
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,680
She's investigated for
collaboration in the heist

410
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,480
<i>and obstruction of justice.</i>

411
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,440
<i>But surely you already know that,</i>

412
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,120
<i>I mean, since you have</i>
<i>such a special relationship.</i>

413
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,480
We know who you are, Salva.

414
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,080
Or should I say,

415
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,720
Sergio Marquina.

416
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,040
<i>So there's no need for you to use</i>
<i>that GPS voice anymore.</i>

417
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,240
<i>Colonel Prieto,</i>

418
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,240
We have a man dying here
because of your gunfire.

419
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,720
If you don't send a doctor in now,

420
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,960
you'll have signed his sentence.

421
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,800
<i>The only one who signed</i>
<i>his sentence is you.</i>

422
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,280
His and that of all the people whose lives
you're destroying with this heist.

423
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,320
Including your friend, the inspector.

424
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,720
How can you bear having
that on your conscience?

425
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,560
Look, if you want

426
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,400
to chat about our conscience,
we can do so later.

427
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,760
But right now we need a doctor.

428
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,960
There will be no "later", Mr. Marquina.

429
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,520
We know you're close.

430
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,560
And we know the location
of the three antennas

431
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,600
that recorded your calls
to the inspector over the last five days.

432
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,040
<i>We'll search every house.</i>

433
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,680
<i>And when you least expect it,</i>
<i>we'll be knocking on your door.</i>

434
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,320
So stop complicating things
and surrender.

435
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,800
Like I told the inspector,

436
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,440
surrendering was never an option.

437
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,960
I'll be here waiting.

438
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,720
Not everyone is letting us
into their homes.

439
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,760
Many people are on their side.
They're heroes on TV.

440
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,640
We're the guys who want to catch them.

441
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,560
Call Judge Andrade
and request a search warrant.

442
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,600
We can't bust into 10,000 homes.

443
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,560
The antennas cover an 850-meter radius.
We have to narrow it down.

444
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,400
Fine, we'll narrow it down.

445
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,360
But call Judge Andrade
and request a search warrant.

446
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,760
I see you've got it all under control.

447
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,840
I don't understand what I'm doing here.

448
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,840
-Am I under arrest?
-No, you're not under arrest.

449
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
You're being investigated.

450
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,480
Okay,

451
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,080
then I'm leaving.

452
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,040
Inspector.

453
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,040
Before you leave,
turn in your badge and your gun.

454
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,320
Tap my phone if you want!

455
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,120
Wait, wait.

456
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,720
You go ahead,
I'll get you a new jumpsuit.

457
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,560
Hi.

458
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
Ari.

459
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,920
Why did you sabotage the escape plan?

460
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,600
Because of Denver?

461
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,360
You hit Arturo
because you two have something.

462
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,120
-Monica, did he force you?
-No.

463
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,360
Why are you with him?

464
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,000
Because I love him.

465
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,000
Because I love him, I know

466
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,080
it may sound ridiculous.

467
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
You might think it's crazy but...

468
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,240
it's real.

469
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
It's real, Ari.

470
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
It's the first time someone has

471
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,720
looked me in the eye and is honest.

472
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,160
He really loves me.

473
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,200
And you...

474
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,120
you're with Berlin?

475
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,560
Just for survival.

476
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,880
I thought they were killing people.

477
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,600
And that they had killed you too.

478
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
I thought I was saving myself.

479
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,160
Come here.

480
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,280
Berlin disgusts me, he makes me sick.

481
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,000
And now the asshole thinks
I have feelings for him,

482
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,680
that we are living a love story.

483
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
He wants me to marry him
when we get out,

484
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,400
to take care of him.

485
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,920
He's sick.

486
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,880
I know.

487
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,680
And are you going to do it?

488
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,680
It'll only be a year.
I don't know, we're going

489
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
to travel the world.

490
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,760
Living like kings.

491
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,520
And going...

492
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
to fancy places and that's it.

493
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,480
Thousands of people
accept these proposals every day.

494
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,000
Ari...

495
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,840
But is it worth it?

496
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,640
I'm going to keep all of his money.

497
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,680
He fucked up my life, Monica.

498
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,320
I take four tranquilizers a day
just to be able to bare his presence.

499
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,720
He raped me.

500
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,440
He raped me.

501
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,120
When he's by my side
and he can no longer move,

502
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,480
when he has only me,

503
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,200
I'll tell him what a son of bitch he is
for all he's done to me.

504
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,200
The calls made by the suspect
over the last five days

505
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,440
were recorded by these three antennas,
located here,

506
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,520
here and here. except the one he made
from the Canillas police station.

507
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,480
You were right. It's a wide radius.

508
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,960
Gomez, ask telecom
to triangulate the signal

509
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,400
to limit the suspect's area of activity.

510
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,240
Everything would be easier
if Angel was here.

511
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,600
He's the only one who knows
the exact location of the hideout.

512
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,040
<i>The inspector was</i>
<i>at the edge of the abyss,</i>

513
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,160
<i>balancing herself</i>
<i>to avoid falling into it for good.</i>

514
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,040
<i>Thinking about how ridiculous it was</i>

515
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,080
<i>to have gone from inspector to suspect</i>
<i>in a couple of minutes.</i>

516
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,640
<i>And she decided to do what her mother</i>
<i>had so often told her to do.</i>

517
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,600
<i>Chase after the bad guys.</i>
