1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,758
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,514
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,972
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,270
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,772
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,854
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,939
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,441
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,614
Previously, on Arrow...

10
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,774
Follow me or die.

11
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,907
Hello, Mr. Queen. My name is Talia.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,196
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

13
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,447
As soon as I'm out of here,

14
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,750
Walker will concoct some reason
to put a bullet in my head.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,577
I think I'm gonna have
to prosecute this one myself.

16
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,248
It could take a while.

17
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,959
I haven't kept my promise to Laurel.

18
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,543
You're gonna train a new Black Canary?

19
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,630
I think that somewhere out there, there is
a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy.

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,551
<i>Now all we've gotta do
is find her.</i>

21
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,686
<i>Protests continue into the final
countdown for tonight's ignition</i>

22
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,222
<i>of S.T.A.R. Labs'
controversial particle accelerator.</i>

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,268
<i>S.T.A.R. Labs founder
and CEO, Harrison Wells,</i>

24
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,108
<i>promises a new era of
scientific advancement is at hand.</i>

25
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,196
Would you look at that?
Future's getting brighter every day.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,994
What do you think, babe?
You a fan of progress?

27
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,868
Why don't you just put a bullet
in my head and be done with it?

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,334
Or maybe you don't
have the sack to pull the trigger.

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,542
I was gonna play another hand,
let you rest some.

30
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,333
But lay down a challenge like that,
what's a guy gonna do?

31
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,960
I'm gonna get what I need from you,

32
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,175
or maybe one of those molars back there.

33
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,338
Forget her.

34
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,137
Hey, Tina. Not looking too good.

35
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,519
But I got something here
that might put a smile on your face.

36
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,555
Look what we got here.

37
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,856
- Oh, my God. Vinny...
- I'm sorry, Tina.

38
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,771
<i>Aw, so sweet.</i>

39
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,939
I thought you two
were just cop buddies, but...

40
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,237
You can tell me, Vin.
You're tapping that sweet ass, aren't you?

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,668
I wasn't sure which one of you to kill.

42
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,959
Thanks for making up my mind for me.
Get the tarp.

43
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,874
No, please, please, please!
Don't hurt him.

44
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,042
Shut up.

45
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,185
<i>Wait, we are now being
told to evacuate the facility.</i>

46
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,937
<i>The storm may have
caused a malfunction</i>

47
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,392
<i>to the primary cooling system.</i>

48
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:19,890
<i>Officials are down...</i>

49
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,403
Sean, lam begging you.

50
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,272
Please.

51
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,891
- No.
- What do you mean, "No?"

52
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,772
- Did you even read her resume?
- Yeah, I did.

53
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,312
So, you know she flew
600 sorties over Iraq,

54
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,943
launched a program for inner-city kids

55
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,820
to get into flight school
as a way out of poverty,

56
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,606
plus, she's got skills in krav maga
and a third-degree black belt.

57
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,867
If Top Gun here is a maybe,

58
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,447
how the hell did I even get on the team?

59
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,112
Don't answer that.

60
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,282
Look, finding a new Black Canary
isn't just about reviewing resumes,

61
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,700
it's a feel thing.

62
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,120
Well, I feel like we're busting
our asses to find you candidates,

63
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,412
and you keep shooting 'em down.

64
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,547
I promised Laurel that
I would carry on her legacy,

65
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,801
I just don't won't Black Siren
to be all that's left of her.

66
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,007
Well, what about this woman?
Allison Slater.

67
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,213
Okay, she's a decorated CIA officer

68
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,641
who also happens to be
a world-champion in judo.

69
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,642
Nope. Okay.

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,437
What about Tara Michele?

71
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,816
Army special ops, but then
she decided to open a clinic downtown

72
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,809
to offer free healthcare to the homeless.

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,482
<i>Okay, well, I will keep digging.</i>

74
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,985
Okay, hold up, what about this one?

75
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,743
This woman got
her engineering PhD at age 20,

76
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,369
won gold in karate at the Olympics,

77
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,243
turned down offers
from the NSA and ARGUS

78
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,907
to join NASA as an astronaut by day,

79
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,327
while at night she secretly protects
the citizens of Houston as, get this,

80
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,583
a ninja vigilante.

81
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,044
Oh, and she works
soup kitchens on Saturdays

82
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,833
and rescues puppies on Sundays.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,503
Astronaut-ninja? You're making that up.

84
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,670
He did.

85
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,010
Karate won't be an
Olympic sport until 2020.

86
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,266
Fine, you got me.

87
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,928
This is just some woman
who teaches preschool in the Glades,

88
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,313
- but my point still stands.
- That point being?

89
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,644
That no matter how amazing they are,

90
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,978
no one's gonna be good enough for you.

91
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,518
<i>Because you keep
comparing them to Laurel,</i>

92
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,483
which is an impossible standard
you might wanna consider loosening.

93
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,899
We just need to keep looking,
to think outside the box.

94
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,692
How far outside the box
are we talking here?

95
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,739
Are we talking way outside the box,
like, urban legends outside?

96
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,741
Because if we are,
I think I might have something.

97
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,410
Wait, what do you mean, "urban legend?"

98
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,374
I mean her.

99
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,871
By her, you mean who?

100
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,757
Well, actually,
I have no idea what her name is,

101
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,884
but according to the chat rooms I visited,

102
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,137
she's a kickass woman
who appears out of nowhere

103
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,047
<i>- and saves crime victims-
- In Star City?</i>

104
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,723
All over America, actually.

105
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,393
And get this, she even has a cry.

106
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,724
Like, a canary cry.

107
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,347
She's a meta,

108
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,228
with the same power as Earth-2 Laurel?

109
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,188
If that isn't <i>bashert,</i>
I don't know what is.

110
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,605
- What?
- <i>Bashert</i> means fate. Destiny.

111
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,443
<i>According to the ARGUS database
I just hacked,</i>

112
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,487
sightings started
three years ago in Central City.

113
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,323
That is right when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

114
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,579
And she even has a black
leather jacket and everything.

115
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,364
Only thing that's really
missing is the blonde hair,

116
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,999
and you can fix that with a wig.

117
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,165
I have to handle
something for John.

118
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,083
Let's see if this urban legend
is the real deal,

119
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,418
and call me when you have something.

120
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,344
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

121
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,634
Just got a text from Adrian,
do you know what it's about?

122
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,973
Maybe to figure out how
Prometheus faked Lyla's voice

123
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,603
to get me out of the bunker and into here.

124
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,934
I'm less concerned
with how you got in here

125
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,724
and more concerned
with getting you out again.

126
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,609
Gentlemen, sorry I'm late.

127
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,779
How you holding up?

128
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,358
Walker's gonna have custody
of me in a week, so...

129
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,824
As soon as Walker gets his hands on John
he's gonna throw him into a hole.

130
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,028
Maybe not.

131
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,285
I've got a buddy
at the National Security Agency.

132
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,205
Turns out they have
General Walker under investigation

133
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,835
and were putting together quite the case.

134
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,793
Wire transfers and some
keyhole satellite images

135
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,798
of his movements with the nuclear trigger.

136
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,296
That's enough to exonerate John.

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,717
Except I don't like
the way you just said,

138
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,465
"were building a case" just now.

139
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,471
Walker has friends in high places.

140
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,473
Managed to get
the investigation slow-rolled.

141
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,679
But the file still exists.

142
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,390
I made a FOIA request,
but seeing as all this is classified,

143
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,388
that could take months, maybe even years.

144
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,312
- That's time we don't have.
- I'm sorry I don't have better news.

145
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,944
No, Adrian, you have gone
above and beyond already.

146
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,230
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,911
Well, Felicity is really going
to enjoy hacking the NSA.

148
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,410
You mean after she's brought you
a hundred Black Canary candidates

149
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,669
for you to say no to?

150
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,005
You're not the only one
who visits, Oliver.

151
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,208
John, I understand what I promised Laurel.

152
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,962
Now that we're actively doing it,
trying to replace her?

153
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,796
<i>N</i> just...

154
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,470
It feels wrong.

155
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,347
She didn't want you to
find someone to replace her,

156
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,012
just someone to take on the mantle.

157
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,233
And from where I'm sitting,
that's two very different things.

158
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,985
Sleeping beauty awakes.

159
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,660
- Where am I?
- Someplace safe.

160
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,195
I have to get back to the Bratva.

161
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,580
Why, so they can finish killing you?

162
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,747
That was Gregor, I have allies there.

163
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,541
I think you'll come to discover
circumstances within the Bratva

164
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,497
a bit more complex than you thought.

165
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,798
Why did you save me?

166
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,678
Well, from what I could tell,
you needed rescuing.

167
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,557
- Where'd you get that?
- Wasn't hard.

168
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,224
Sneaking past a bunch of oafish Bratva
is hardly a test of my skills.

169
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,017
Why did you do that?

170
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,063
Shipwrecked on Lian Yu, fled to Hong Kong,

171
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,901
the Omega Virus, Shadowspire,

172
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,320
and now, you're mixed up with the Bratva.

173
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,206
But along the way,
you went back home to Starling City,

174
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,368
though you couldn't bear to
reveal yourself to your family.

175
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,751
- How do you know this?
- I did my homework.

176
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,252
What makes me so interesting?

177
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,382
You wear the hood of one of my students.

178
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,597
Yao Fei Gulong?

179
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,273
You get my text about John?

180
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,605
If there is any trace
of the file that Digg needs,

181
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,610
it's gonna be buried
behind some serious firewalls.

182
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,442
Actually, firewalls don't
even begin to explain it,

183
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,778
it's gonna be more like
fire castles, or fire mountains.

184
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,067
How did you know where to start?

185
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,236
All that I told you was that
Chase might have something.

186
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,871
Yeah, and then I hacked his laptop.

187
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,991
Saving Digg is gonna break
at least 12 federal laws.

188
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,252
Hacking your DA is just small ball.

189
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,208
Plus, you are the mayor,
you can pardon me.

190
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,459
Actually, I can't.

191
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,339
It doesn't matter because I am having fun.

192
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,751
I haven't done a good old
grab-government-secrets kind of hack

193
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,918
in a really long time

194
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,179
and it's a great change of pace
and it feels awesome.

195
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,805
And it'll keep me busy while you're gone.

196
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,809
- I'm going somewhere?
- Maybe Hub City.

197
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,436
We're thinking that's where
the new Black Canary is hanging out.

198
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,764
Yeah, let's not call her that just yet,

199
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,477
I'd like to see her
in the field at least first.

200
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,934
Ask and you shall receive.

201
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,146
I was able to track down cell phone
footage of her latest act of heroism.

202
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,028
Heroine-ism? Heroism. Anyway, take a look.

203
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,321
The video isn't clear enough
for facial recog,

204
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,827
<i>but she's real all right.</i>

205
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,534
I've watched it, like, ten times.
The woman can fight.

206
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,371
She can focus the sound
better than Black Siren,

207
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,206
and she is more skilled at hand-to-hand.

208
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,333
This is almost like...
What was that word that you used?

209
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,217
- <i>Bashert.</i>
- Yeah, that.

210
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,970
It almost sounds like
you'd be willing to give her a look.

211
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,842
- Call Rene, we're going to Hub City.
- Mmm.

212
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,863
<i>Stop!</i>

213
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,952
Wow.

214
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,379
Costume Warehouse having
a fire sale I didn't know about?

215
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,665
What do you what?

216
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,342
You're a vigilante and a meta-human.

217
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,178
For the past three years,
you've been working alone.

218
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,634
We have a proposition for you.

219
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,267
Oh, I'm sorry, you were doing fine.
You take it, yeah.

220
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,888
We'd like you to join us.

221
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,937
<i>I can give you a home,</i>

222
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,393
and a team,

223
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,150
and a place to better train
the use of your power.

224
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,193
I can take care of myself.

225
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,528
Oh, and if you get in my way,

226
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,864
I'll send the three of you back
to Star City with your nuts in a sling.

227
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,341
I thought that went pretty good.

228
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,520
Hey, man, what are
we still doing around this dump?

229
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,224
Leather jacket lady made it seem
pretty clear about us screwing off.

230
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,438
When have you ever known me
to give up that easily?

231
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,275
Never. The answer to that is, "Never."
That might have been implied.

232
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,609
We're not gonna find a better candidate.

233
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,570
Any progress on the facial
recognition from the body cams?

234
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,944
Sorry, but the Wi-Fi
in here is incredibly slow.

235
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,452
You take your time,

236
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,406
I got three patties
and three slices of cheddar to go.

237
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,828
That's disgusting.

238
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,785
Okay, actually, got it.

239
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,166
Our screaming sonic lady has a name.

240
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,715
Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.

241
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,543
That tracks, she was in Central City
when the particle accelerator exploded.

242
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,378
And after that she went off the grid,

243
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,467
which means that we have
no way of finding her.

244
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,631
Yes, we do.

245
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,271
- Captain Singh.
- I need information.

246
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,645
- Who is this?
- It's the Green Arrow.

247
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,779
Or some nutjob with a voice modulator.

248
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,486
<i>You want help, I'm gonna need proof.</i>

249
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,082
Very clever.

250
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,710
<i>Fine, what do you wanna know?</i>

251
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,417
Tina Boland.
She was CCPD, what happened to her?

252
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,796
<i>Nothing but tragedy there.</i>

253
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,425
She went deep undercover
and her partner got killed in action.

254
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,715
Her partner's name was...

255
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,551
<i>- Vincent Sobel.
- Yeah.</i>

256
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,386
Tina quit the force
the day after his funeral

257
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,720
and we haven't heard from her since.

258
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,011
<i>- Is she in some kind of trouble?
- Not</i> sure <i>yet.</i>

259
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,013
You get anything, give me a call.

260
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,852
I've always had a soft spot for Boland.

261
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,271
- She's a good kid.
- Will do.

262
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,691
Looks like our Tina is trying
to avenge her former partner.

263
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,200
Which means we have a lead.

264
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,495
Trained Yao Fei?

265
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,582
How's that possible?
You're half his age.

266
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,501
Don't you know it's improper
to talk about a woman's age?

267
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,631
Let's just say it's a family secret.

268
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,892
So, you found me because of Yao Fei?

269
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,177
Congratulations.

270
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,014
Yao Fei's gone.

271
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,064
I found you because
the world needs people like you.

272
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,445
The man who survived all this

273
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,904
is destined for so much more
than playing gangster in Russia.

274
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,411
You know, if you knew me so well,
you'd know that I made a promise...

275
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,867
A promise, yes.

276
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,032
To get revenge on Konstantine Kovar.

277
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,912
I have something that will help.

278
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,459
<i>That is Misha Yurievich,</i>

279
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,551
a black-market smuggler with
a particular specialty, young girls.

280
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,968
You might guess his top customer.

281
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,591
Kovar.

282
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,556
We take down Yurievich
and that leaves Kovar

283
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,103
without his key revenue stream.

284
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,013
<i>NW e?“</i>

285
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,265
You should be honored
I'm offering my services.

286
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,362
Let me help you dispose of Yurievich,

287
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,648
then you will hear me out
with what I have to say.

288
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,283
At the very least, you'll be dealing
a major blow to your enemy.

289
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,746
Oh, thank God. You are a lifesaver.

290
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,461
Yeah, well, I figure you gotta
get your share of fast food

291
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,594
before they lock you up
in Lompoc for hacking the NSA.

292
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,969
Lompoc doesn't house female inmates,

293
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,471
they'd probably send me to Hazelton,

294
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,224
or they would
if there was anything to hack.

295
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,683
Uh, you lost me.

296
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,597
The file containing all the dirt on
General Walker, it's gone. Scrubbed.

297
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,015
So, what does that mean?

298
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,065
Well, it means that John
is back to being totally screwed.

299
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,324
There's no sign of Boland.

300
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,076
<i>You sure this is
the right spot, Mr. Terrific?</i>

301
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,327
Am I still Mr. Terrific if I'm on comms
and not in uniform?

302
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,000
Anyway, yeah, I cross-referenced
the ATM withdrawals,

303
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,832
and pings from a burner cell phone.

304
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,996
Detective Boland is here, room 511,

305
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,752
<i>should be straight down the hall.</i>

306
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,672
Whoa.

307
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,345
Homegirl clearly never met a trash can.

308
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,975
Even though she's not on the force,
she's still playing detective.

309
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,140
No, she's not playing.
She's out for blood.

310
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,062
That's her dead partner.

311
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,069
Mr. Terrific, are you seeing
these names on the body cams?

312
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,692
Already running them.

313
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,196
- Drop the hammer.
- Get out!

314
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,698
No, don't go, help me, please!

315
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,028
Tina...

316
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,423
Sonic dampener, new and improved.

317
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,386
He's dead.

318
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,185
Hello, team?

319
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,944
Looks like we're gonna have some company.

320
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,617
- Can't let her go!
- Get her, I got this.

321
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,104
We didn't get to finish
our last conversation.

322
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,369
- You're persistent.
- You killed that man.

323
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,206
Before, I thought you were worried
I was the one who was gonna end up dead.

324
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,121
- Make up your mind.
- Detective Boland.

325
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,170
If you know I was police,

326
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,882
then you know that guy back in my place
helped kill my partner.

327
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,387
Your vendetta doesn't end with him.

328
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,675
No, I'm still looking for his boss.

329
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,302
His friends are the ones currently
shooting it out with your friends.

330
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,312
We can help you get him without
anyone else dying in the process,

331
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,189
including and especially, you.

332
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,690
You know, from what I hear,

333
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,814
there are plenty of nutcases
running around Star City

334
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,320
looking to make it a better place.

335
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,981
What makes me so special?

336
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,325
Maybe stay in the same spot
for more than a minute

337
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,826
and I'll get a chance to tell it.

338
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,659
Well, if you're gonna make
a sales pitch, make it good.

339
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,288
You went through something traumatic.

340
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,212
For the past three years
you've been trying to understand it

341
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,626
because you're afraid
of what happened to you,

342
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,336
and of what you've become.

343
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,004
So, you're running from it.

344
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,349
- How would you know?
- Because I've been there.

345
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,511
And I can help you find your way back.

346
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,731
Okay.

347
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,356
What's the range on that...

348
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,776
What did you call it, sonic dampener?

349
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,905
That's what I thought.

350
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,300
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

351
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,669
You know, I would tell you
to chew with your mouth closed,

352
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,055
but I don't even know how
you could do that with this thing.

353
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,050
Five-stack, baby. Nothing better.

354
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,351
Curtis.

355
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,812
Yeah, so I've made some sense
out of Tina's crazy murder-board.

356
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,560
Meet Sean Sonus.

357
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,400
Three years ago, he was a player in
Central City's criminal underworld

358
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,155
and the target of Tina's investigation.

359
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,739
Interestingly, Sonus disappeared
around the same time that Tina did.

360
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,744
That's why she's been
traveling across the country,

361
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,904
she's been following him.

362
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,907
The only thing I don't understand
is why Sonus is in Hub City now.

363
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,408
Tobias Church.

364
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,210
Your belly hurts?
Yeah, that's not surprising.

365
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,416
"Tobias Church."

366
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,125
He had all the gangs
in Hub City under his thumb,

367
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,710
just like he tried to do back home.

368
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,592
I'm thinking with Church's demise,
it left a power vacuum here,

369
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,877
especially in the drug trade.

370
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,136
What's Sonus pushing?

371
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,174
Some drug I've never
heard of before called "Sly-Dee?"

372
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,638
It's pronounced "slide,"
like in playground,

373
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,645
'cause it hooks kids young and
makes them move to the big stuff faster.

374
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,397
<i>If Boland's after this scumbag,</i>

375
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,557
I vote we get out of her way
and let her do her thing.

376
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,771
<i>I can't believe
I'm about to say this,</i>

377
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,777
but I actually agree with Rene.

378
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,030
- I can't believe it, either.
- And then there's this.

379
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,199
The After-Action Report
on her partner's death.

380
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,827
Sonus' men captured her
and tortured her for two weeks.

381
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,862
So even if she didn't drop
out of the police,

382
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,372
she would have been
put on indefinite leave

383
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,623
because of psychological trauma.

384
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,455
All the more reason
not to leave her out there alone.

385
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,119
Look, I didn't know this Laurel chick,

386
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,755
but you're taking on a lot
to keep this promise to her.

387
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,460
I'm thinking this is about
more than just Laurel.

388
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,625
If Sonus is connected to Church's men,

389
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,461
that makes him more dangerous
than we thought.

390
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,800
We need to find Boland
before she gets involved

391
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,465
in something that she can't handle.

392
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,642
<i>What's the plan?</i>

393
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,394
Follow my lead.

394
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,738
We're walking into a fortress
and you're gonna use just a bow?

395
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,943
To use a bow and arrow
requires patience and discipline.

396
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,667
<i>That's Yurievich.</i>

397
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,003
I will take on his guards, Yurievich...

398
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,543
Yurievich is mine.

399
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,641
Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.

400
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,017
I didn't sleep.

401
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,189
I thought the NSA was a dead end.
The file was erased.

402
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,855
Yeah, but then I remembered nothing
on the internet is ever erased.

403
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,395
<i>Everything leaves behind a digital shadow</i>

404
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,653
and I've been scouring
the dark web trying to find it.

405
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,027
- What's that?
- A terminal message.

406
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,698
- From who?
- I have absolutely no idea.

407
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,457
And how'd they get into your system?

408
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,869
I have absolutely no idea.

409
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,588
<i>- Who's "Ghost Fox Goddess?"
- It's me.</i>

410
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,965
It was my hacker handle in college.

411
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,298
I made a lot of bad choices in college.

412
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,966
What do you mean, bad choices?

413
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,923
I used to be a hacktivist,
it's a hacker activist.

414
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,386
I left that life way behind,

415
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,222
what with the goth look
that was not good for me.

416
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,431
Goth?

417
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,687
Mmm-hmm. Dark hair, dark Felicity,

418
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,515
taking on corporations and governments.

419
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,191
It was a power trip though,
it wasn't healthy.

420
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,070
What's "IRL?"

421
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,069
In real life.

422
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,076
Yo, you know what you're doing there?

423
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,240
Are you kidding me?

424
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,250
I hacked all the traffic cams
in my hometown on a dare.

425
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,420
So, this is gonna help us
find Ms. Loco Bananas?

426
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,040
Or Sonus. Either way...

427
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,801
Either way, we're gonna
put ourselves in the middle

428
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,005
of a showdown between a nutbar
and a psycho drug dealer.

429
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,386
When Oliver explained
his thinking to us on this,

430
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,098
which he rarely ever does, by the way,

431
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,095
I thought you would be more onboard.

432
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,772
How'd the last crazy recruit turn out?

433
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,185
Okay, Evelyn did have her issues,
true, but so did Rory.

434
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,945
And Oliver channeled his vendetta
into something positive.

435
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,948
And as far as nutcases are concerned...

436
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,368
As far as nutcases are concerned, what?

437
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,949
Nothing. I...

438
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,822
That was a... It was a period.

439
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,082
"As far as nutcases are concerned."
Period.

440
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,413
That was just, it wasn't... That's it.

441
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,294
You were thinking of me, weren't you?

442
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,295
I meant it in the nicest way.

443
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,957
I guess you're right.

444
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,508
- I am?
- Yeah.

445
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,968
Maybe this team is all about
finding second chances.

446
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,020
Could you hand me that adapter and tablet?

447
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,225
Yep.

448
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:11,974
Thanks.

449
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,153
- Got a location.
- Nutbar or psycho drug dealer?

450
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,986
- Psycho drug dealer.
- Great.

451
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:32,870
Check it out.

452
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,177
Hey, Sean. Been a while.

453
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,849
Detective Boland.

454
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,558
A little outside
your jurisdiction, aren't you?

455
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,017
I'm not a cop tonight.

456
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,113
Get away from her.

457
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:12,743
Son of a bitch!

458
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,928
What the hell was that?

459
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,011
Sonus...

460
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,763
He's a meta-human, too.

461
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,736
- How is she?
- Still unconscious.

462
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,315
I don't know about you, man,
but my head is still spinning a bit.

463
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,573
It's his meta-power.

464
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,242
I think he can control sonic waves.

465
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,408
It would explain how he disoriented
you guys and counteracted Tina and...

466
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,037
Their powers are related.

467
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,164
- What do you mean?
- I think I have an idea.

468
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,292
I didn't sign up for metas, man.

469
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,707
Enhanced ability or not,

470
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,919
Sonus is running a drug trade
that sells to kids.

471
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,763
If that means we're moving on
from trying to recruit this crazy lady

472
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,595
and focus on taking
down this prig, I'm all in.

473
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,509
Yeah, but we have to find Sonus first.

474
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,768
I know where he's gonna be.

475
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,851
What time is it?

476
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,267
11:40. Where are you going?

477
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,070
Sonus is taking in
a major shipment of Slyde.

478
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,229
And you know where.

479
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,315
And something tells me
you're not gonna tell us.

480
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,989
After three years,
the man who killed my partner

481
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,530
is finally in my sights,
I'm not letting anyone get in my way.

482
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,165
Lady wants to commit suicide,
we should let her.

483
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,415
<i>Free country.</i>

484
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,088
He nearly killed you last time.

485
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,631
Against him, your ability is a liability.

486
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,717
Let us help.

487
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,970
Hey, thanks for the save.
Safe trip back to Star City, boys.

488
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,288
Yurievich is dead.

489
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,582
Good. Now we can talk.

490
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,088
Look sharp.

491
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,891
<i>If this goes south on me,
I want you to take this guy down, hard.</i>

492
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,097
Paranoid much?

493
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,888
You don't know
the dark web like I do, okay?

494
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,807
These guys aren't exactly
known to be friendly.

495
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,067
- OMG!
- OMG.

496
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,196
The Ghost Fox Goddess, here in meatspace.

497
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,981
The real Ghost Fox Goddess!

498
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,617
- You're Kojo Sledgehammer?
- Yeah.

499
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,325
I know it's not nearly as cool
as "Ghost Fox Goddess,"

500
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,910
but then, I can only aspire
to your level of cool.

501
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,576
Which I do. Aspire to, I mean.

502
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,494
Take her down hard, you said, right?

503
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,582
Hey...

504
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,797
It is so great to meet you.

505
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,924
When I saw your traffic on the darknets,

506
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,713
I wasn't even sure it was you.

507
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,555
I mean, you've been a blank
for, well, years.

508
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,802
- I've been busy.
- I know, Palmer Tech.

509
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,017
I just figured
once you got fired, you'd...

510
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,025
- Figured I'd what?
- It's none of my business.

511
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,937
Okay, well,

512
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,316
I became a hacker, a hacktivist,

513
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,777
because of you.

514
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,616
The GFG.

515
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,120
I read about your hack of the
Department of Education, and I was, like,

516
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,368
"I know what I wanna be."

517
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,504
But then you just totally stopped
and became this, like,

518
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,915
information technology
support player and...

519
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,508
Sorry. Never meet your heroes, you know?

520
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,890
No, I haven't just been corporate,
you know, I've been doing work that is...

521
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,217
Important.

522
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,061
If it was, I would've heard about it.

523
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,227
Oh, sorry, there I go again.

524
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,819
I guess I was just excited
when I saw you on the darknets.

525
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,527
It was like...
Like you were returning, you know?

526
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,692
The O.G. GFG was back.

527
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,572
Well, I was looking for an NSA file
to exonerate an innocent man.

528
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,160
- John Diggle.
- Yes.

529
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,456
- My organization does its homework.
- Organization?

530
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,041
A hacktivist group,
we call ourselves Helix.

531
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,668
A month ago, we hacked ECHELON.

532
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,671
- The NSA's information gathering program?
- Mmm-hmm.

533
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,002
We hoovered up eight petabytes of data.

534
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,547
Including everything you need
to help your friend.

535
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,888
We're calling the data cache "Pandora."

536
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,807
With it, you can take down politicians,

537
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,940
bankrupt companies, spark revolutions.

538
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,901
So, you're not just
giving me the file for John?

539
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,813
You inspired me
to make the world a better place.

540
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,199
And now I intend to inspire you

541
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,908
to be the hacktivist you used to be,

542
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,824
the great Ghost Fox Goddess.

543
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,349
Let me guess.

544
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,686
You're trusting me with your mask off
so now I'm supposed to trust you?

545
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,019
No, I just thought that if you weren't
gonna listen to the Green Arrow,

546
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,812
that you might listen to Oliver Queen.

547
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,696
Nice to meet you.

548
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,738
I spent five years in hell.

549
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,948
Not unlike what happened to you

550
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,239
when you were undercover
in Sonus' organization.

551
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,250
Or what he put you through when
he discovered you were a cop.

552
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,254
And, what, you think you see
a little bit of yourself in me?

553
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,756
It's more than that.

554
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,918
There is a man in Star City

555
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,923
who's trying to convince me

556
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,088
that I destroy the lives
of everyone that I touch

557
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,882
because I am beyond redemption.

558
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,017
Yeah, and you think if you can save me
you'll prove him wrong?

559
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,679
- Don't put your issues on me.
- Absolutely right.

560
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,559
But if you think that you can take on
Sonus and his men then you are wrong.

561
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,936
Let us help.

562
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,821
Let us help, and then we're gone.

563
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,958
<i>All right.</i>

564
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,088
I'm reading fifteen shooters
on the roof and a helicopter inbound.

565
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,224
Copy, we're in position.

566
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,644
Shipment's late.

567
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,431
Some screw-up in Blüdhaven.

568
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,769
Take a hundred grand off.

569
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,859
- We need to move.
- Patience.

570
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,320
You still have Curtis'
insurance policy with you?

571
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,154
Yeah, but I'm still gonna
get to use my guns, right?

572
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,528
<i>Chopper's about to land, guys.</i>

573
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,325
Move.

574
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,996
Kill 'em all!

575
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,515
Not so fast, dirtbag.

576
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,143
Yes! Yes.

577
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,067
They got air support.

578
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,702
All right, I'll take care of it.
But, Wild Dog...

579
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:26,908
I got her six.

580
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,246
Guess I should be flattered.

581
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,296
To think you've held out a candle
for me after all these years.

582
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,630
- What are you waiting for?
- Tina...

583
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,973
Don't do it. You're better than this.

584
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,346
You know I'm not.

585
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,604
If we're as alike as you said,
we both know you'd kill him.

586
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,939
You're right.

587
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,113
Maybe it's too late for me,

588
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,904
and maybe I don't get a second chance.

589
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,579
You don't have to go down that road.

590
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,461
Do you know what
would Vince want you to do?

591
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,593
He'd want me to do that.

592
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,313
<i>He'!-</i>

593
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,810
Let her go.

594
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,991
Hey. Oh, man.

595
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,207
I was gonna ask how
it went with the new Canary,

596
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,088
but I can tell by that look on your face.

597
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,634
- Well, I have some good news, though.
- I am in the market.

598
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,930
I've got all we need to exonerate John.

599
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,808
That's incredible. How'd you do that?

600
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,349
Long story.

601
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,145
Is there something you're not telling me?

602
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,610
I know that we are
not used to getting good news,

603
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,734
but this is what it looks like.

604
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,284
Lam gonna go leak the file on Walker.

605
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,654
Why don't you go tell John the good news?

606
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,064
- What's going on?
- You tell him.

607
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,574
Tell me what?

608
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,907
Earlier this evening, I received
the NSA's case against Walker

609
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,323
- from an anonymous source.
- Anonymous?

610
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,537
<i>On the strength of it,
I went to the Judge Advocate</i>

611
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,576
<i>ex parte,</i> and got you released on bail.

612
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,495
Wait, what?

613
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,914
I filed a motion to dismiss

614
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,878
which is as close to
a slam dunk as these things get,

615
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,257
given the cards we're holding.

616
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,459
What does this mean?

617
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,430
It means that you can go home,
and hug your wife and son.

618
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,899
You wanted this, baited me with Yurievich.

619
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,439
Yes.

620
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,034
To see for yourself what I've become?

621
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,535
To remind you.

622
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,031
Why go to all the trouble?

623
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,951
Huh? What do you care?
You don't even know me.

624
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,540
I thought I'd proven otherwise.

625
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:51,002
General Shrieve, Baron Reiter,
Konstantine Kovar.

626
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,090
You keep looking for new fights

627
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,847
when the real fight has been
in front of you all along.

628
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,134
Your father literally wrote it for you,

629
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,100
a list of all the Yurievichs
and Kovars in Starling City.

630
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,981
He told me. He left me a message.

631
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,767
And yet you still don't return home.

632
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,276
Why do you deny
your father's wish for you?

633
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,109
You saw the reason tonight.

634
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,194
I am not the man that my father raised.

635
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,401
Not anymore.

636
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,871
You're afraid of what's happened to you,

637
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,498
of what you've become,
and you're running from it.

638
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,626
- How do you know all this?
- Because I've been there.

639
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,173
And I can help you find your way back.

640
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,965
You think yourself a monster.

641
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,093
No.

642
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,143
I am a monster.

643
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:57,192
There is a monster inside you,
yes, but it is not you.

644
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,698
I don't see the difference.

645
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,580
No, you need to create one.

646
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,995
You need to give the monster an identity.

647
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,465
It's only when the monster
becomes someone else,

648
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,631
something else,
that you're free to be Oliver Queen.

649
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,067
I don't know if I'm ready.

650
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,237
I will help you become ready.

651
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,919
<i>Mr. Mayor, excuse me,</i>

652
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,961
but there's someone here to see you.
Her name is Tina Boland.

653
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,129
Yeah, send her in, please.

654
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,938
Mayor Queen. It's impressive.

655
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,605
Maybe you should've led with that.

656
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:18,073
I gotta admit,
I didn't think I'd see you again.

657
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,157
Yeah, neither did I.

658
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:27,328
I guess I thought
I would feel different...

659
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,957
...with Sonus gone.

660
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,787
I thought I would feel...

661
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,837
- Liberated.
- I wish it worked that way.

662
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,135
How do you do it?

663
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,389
How do you keep living with so much pain?

664
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,103
I'm still working on that myself.

665
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,521
But I can tell you
it helps to not be alone.

666
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,899
That's why you're here, right?

667
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,116
That's why I'm here.

668
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,043
Back on the roof, you asked
what Vince would have wanted.

669
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,294
We were more than just partners,

670
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,127
we were lovers.

671
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,298
I hated Sonus for killing Vince.

672
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:31,138
But I hated myself more
for not being able to stop him.

673
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,273
Rene, the guy in the hockey mask,

674
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,357
told the other guy
that was with us, Curtis,

675
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,525
that this team is all about
finding second chances.

676
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,161
You said maybe
we don't get second chances.

677
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,614
Well, maybe I was wrong.

678
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,875
Maybe you're my second chance.

679
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,797
That's a lot to put on my shoulders.

680
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,209
Well, Tina, there's something
that tells me you can handle it.

681
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,389
So about that name...

682
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:10,511
"Tina Boland" was my official cover
for undercover work.

683
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,562
It was to protect my family.

684
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,225
My real name is Dinah.

685
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,067
Dinah Drake.

686
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,444
Dinah?

687
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,612
Does that name mean something to you?

688
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,276
I had a friend named Dinah.

689
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,619
She's the reason I sought you out.

690
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,332
What do you think
she'd think about all this?

691
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,419
I think she'd be proud of both of us.
