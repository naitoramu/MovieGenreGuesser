1
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,290
Father Lantom.
Clinton Church.

2
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,450
...bright idea to bring him in?

3
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,440
He's one of ours, Maggie.
What other choice did I have?

4
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,310
Metro-General maybe? Call 911.

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,610
He's a vigilante.

6
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,240
If he goes to a hospital,
the police will arrest him.

7
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,720
This is Sister Maggie Grace
at St. Agnes Orphanage...

8
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,990
It's Matthew. Jack Murdock's son.

9
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I'm very sorry. I made a mistake.

10
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,420
Get wire cutters.
We need to get him out of this suit.

11
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,300
Go to the kitchen and bring... we have.

12
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,260
- How can I help?
- You've done enough.

13
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,890
Where did you go, Elektra?

14
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
We're gonna die here.

15
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,770
This is what living feels like.

16
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,380
Get Maggie. Tell her he's awake.

17
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,550
Elektra...

18
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,590
- How do you feel?
- Don't try to stand up.

19
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,760
Where... where...

20
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,930
St. Agnes. The orphanage.

21
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,850
- How long? How long?
- Lay down. Several weeks.

22
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,350
- Where is she?
- Who?

23
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,430
Elektra. I...

24
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,730
I don't know who that is.

25
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,230
Stay in the bed.

26
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,610
- You'll hurt yourself.
- My right ear... I can't...

27
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,150
Just stop this right now!

28
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,620
Damn it, Matthew!

29
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,490
Now I can't see. I can't see.

30
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,620
I can't see!

31
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,080
I can't see! I can't see!

32
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,710
Matthew?

33
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,420
Father.

34
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,800
I didn't know you were there.

35
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,720
Must feel strange to be back here.

36
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,050
The place where you grew up.

37
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,770
I haven't thanked you yet, Father.

38
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,140
Figured we could count on the nuns
for their discretion.

39
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,150
The nuns know who you are,
but Sister Maggie swore them to secrecy.

40
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,860
After she swore at me.

41
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,200
If you want to take Communion...

42
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,280
we could, uh...

43
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,040
Or we could just talk.

44
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,630
Elektra...

45
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,840
was with me when the building collapsed.

46
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,090
Matthew, Elektra passed months ago.

47
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,220
- We had a funeral for her.
- No, shh... I remember.

48
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,350
I know it sounds crazy.
I'm telling you, she was there.

49
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,350
I was...

50
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,900
holding on to her when...

51
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,360
In any case, the building was surrounded
when it collapsed.

52
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,400
Nobody else was seen getting out.

53
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,030
I am so sorry, Matthew.

54
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,790
How about I take your confession
and we go ahead with the Eucharist?

55
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,670
Not today, Father.

56
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,750
Mystical thinking is not my bag, Matthew.

57
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,260
Hell, I'm probably the most rational crank
in the whole diocese,

58
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,220
but even I have to admit...
it is a miracle you survived.

59
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,520
Our conversations,
they usually go this way.

60
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,780
I come to you with questions.
You tell me what you understand about God.

61
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,860
- Nature of the gig, I guess.
- Give it a rest, shall we?

62
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,910
Sure.

63
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,120
I'll be around. I'll, uh...

64
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,540
When you're ready to talk...

65
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,630
we'll talk.

66
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,590
Is he dead?

67
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,510
Boo.

68
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,190
- Who are you?
- Same as you.

69
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,310
I grew up here.

70
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,480
Damn! What happened to you?

71
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,150
Life.

72
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,070
This room is off limits.

73
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,410
And if you're well enough to be up,
you're well enough to be in class.

74
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,660
Sorry, Sister.

75
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Hello again, Matthew.

76
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,830
They're scared of you, huh?

77
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,840
So were you when you were their age.

78
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,090
I need to change your gauze.

79
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,390
Preferably without you flailing around
like an idiot.

80
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,140
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
by any of this.

81
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,400
You were always pissed off.

82
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,570
Of course, back then,
you were just a boy who lost his eyesight.

83
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,110
And now,
you're the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

84
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,660
You've heard of me.

85
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,950
I live in an orphanage, not under a rock.

86
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,580
I just never imagined it'd be one of ours
running around in that Halloween costume.

87
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,710
The things I've heard you can do...

88
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,090
You are blind, right?

89
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,010
You weren't just faking it the whole time?

90
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,090
Congratulations.

91
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,510
You finally caught me.

92
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,770
It's not a fair question?

93
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,190
Yeah, the accident blinded me.

94
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,360
It just also, uh,
sharpened my other senses.

95
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,190
Not to worry, Sister.

96
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,780
Those days are behind me.

97
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,700
I'm deaf in my right ear,
and I can't even walk to the bathroom now.

98
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,540
Yeah, well, you're pretty banged up.

99
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,750
Your spine, your hip.

100
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,380
Well, the days of doing backflips
might be over, but...

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,010
you'll get back on your feet.

102
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,090
Now that you're out of the woods...

103
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,930
You want me to go.

104
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,520
It's not a convalescent home.

105
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,520
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

106
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,770
I'll figure something out.

107
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,320
There must be at least one person
I can call for you.

108
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,110
No.

109
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,030
There's no one.

110
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,040
Yeah. No, I filed that story already.

111
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,500
Yeah! No, look...

112
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,960
Oh, that. No.
Uh, part five still needs a quote.

113
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,130
I put out a few lines.
We'll get a bite soon.

114
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,290
Yeah, okay.

115
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,500
Yeah, I'll have it for you
by the end of the day.

116
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,380
All right. Yeah. Bye.

117
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,270
Shit.

118
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,060
What am I doing here, Matt?

119
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,310
I have something that I need you to see.

120
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,490
I'm Daredevil.

121
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,630
How was the walk?

122
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,130
I just needed some space.

123
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,850
- It's a lot...
- No, of course. I get it.

124
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,470
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

125
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,810
Can you see me?

126
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,850
No. No, not "see" exactly.

127
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,810
It's different. It's, um...

128
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,360
I think it's better.

129
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,690
"Different" how? "Better" how?

130
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,700
Well, I can sense things about you.

131
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,830
Okay. Like what?

132
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,710
Oh, God.
It's really hard to explain. Um...

133
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,580
Try me.

134
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,380
I know that you stopped
on the way over here.

135
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,170
At our favorite Indian place.

136
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,090
Probably it was a trip down memory lane,

137
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,970
'cause you didn't eat
but you did order a drink.

138
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,140
See, I can smell the curry
on your clothes, and I can...

139
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,730
taste the Jameson's off your lips.

140
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,600
I know that just telling you all that
makes you uncomfortable...

141
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,060
'cause I can hear your heartbeat.

142
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,360
This is humiliating.

143
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,240
Karen, I should've told you.
You have every right to be angry...

144
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,080
Yeah. I should be.
I should be really angry at you.

145
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,790
But I watched you fight for me.

146
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,120
Twice, actually.

147
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,290
You know I dreamed about that?

148
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,420
I played it over in my mind
again and again, and I keep...

149
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,180
How can I be this mad
at someone who saved my life?

150
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,390
Because he's your friend and you care
for him and he broke your trust.

151
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,890
Yeah, well, stop agreeing with me.
It's making it worse.

152
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,980
Can I get you a drink?

153
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,070
And he knows I nodded.

154
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,700
So, the whole cane thing,
it's just... an act?

155
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,290
Yep.

156
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Sorry.

157
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Why?

158
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,340
Why didn't you trust me?

159
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,470
- What, did you think I would judge you?
- No.

160
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,270
I didn't judge Frank.
Why would I judge you?

161
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,890
Well, maybe you should judge Frank.

162
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,680
Castle's a killer. I'm not.

163
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,890
You don't always know
what motivates people.

164
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,020
Uh, yeah, but I know when they lie to me.
Their heartbeats tell me.

165
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,360
Here's what I know.
I will never lie to you again.

166
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,030
That's a promise. All right?
Ask me anything.

167
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,500
Where do you keep it?

168
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,460
In the closet. In the chest.

169
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,430
Holy shit.

170
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,180
What... what happens now?

171
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,520
It's over. That's it.
I'm gonna leave Daredevil behind.

172
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,100
Really? You can just do that?

173
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,190
Yeah.

174
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,990
You know... you and Foggy
had me almost convinced it was alcohol.

175
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,070
It makes a lot of sense.

176
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,450
You know, the secrecy, abandoning social
and professional commitments.

177
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,830
It... It certainly sounds like an addict.

178
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,830
- Well, it's not like that.
- Help me out, then, because I'm not you.

179
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,830
I can't tell if you're lying to me or not.

180
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,020
I don't need him
to be a part of me anymore.

181
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,690
And I don't want him to be.

182
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,160
I want to believe you.

183
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,080
I'm not so sure Daredevil is the problem.

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ouch.

185
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,680
Shit.

186
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,720
Karen?

187
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,390
Hey, Karen, you here?

188
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,270
- Hey. You okay?
- Hey. Yeah.

189
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,810
- Yeah, yeah, fine. Thanks for coming.
- Did the building manager let you in?

190
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Um...

191
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,940
I thought you said
you were packing the place up.

192
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,110
Yeah. Uh...

193
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,160
Remember how I told you

194
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,700
I was gonna talk to Matt's landlord
about letting his place go?

195
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,780
Uh-huh.

196
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,660
Surprise.

197
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,750
What, so when you asked me
to help you move boxes...

198
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,580
Uh, yeah, I lied.

199
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,130
I mean, technically it was more of,
like, a ruse.

200
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,630
- Gotcha. You rused.
- Hmm.

201
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
Journalism has changed you, Page.

202
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,930
So what am I doing here?

203
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,010
Oh! Uh... Right. Yeah. So...

204
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,060
Wait! Are you living here?

205
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,730
Oh! No. God, no.
I'm just paying the bills,

206
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,150
or some of them,
until Matt gets back, but, um...

207
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,150
Matt's being evicted.

208
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,660
Yeah, I need you to help me convince
his landlord to give me an extension.

209
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,580
- Karen...
- No, just, carrying two rents...

210
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm behind this month. That's all.

211
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,090
As much as it hurts me to say this,

212
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,720
you're a reporter.

213
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,480
Look at the facts.
A building fell on Matt. A big one.

214
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,310
And nobody's heard from him since.

215
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,350
Matt's dead.

216
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,490
That's the first time
I've said that out loud.

217
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,660
I don't want to accept it, either.

218
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,580
Especially since I'm the one who...

219
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,200
- you know...
- No.

220
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,330
- ...brought him the Devil suit.
- Hey, don't...

221
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,170
do that to yourself.

222
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,590
You know that was his choice.
He'd have gotten to that suit

223
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,500
whether you brought it to him or not.

224
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,550
I know.

225
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,720
But it doesn't stop me from wishing
I'd brought him some sweatpants instead.

226
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,730
You're right. Everything you're saying
is making sense. I just...

227
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,780
I know it's irrational...

228
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,900
but I can just feel it.

229
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,820
He's not dead.

230
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,130
I'll take care of these
and one more month's rent.

231
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,380
No, no. Uh...

232
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,800
Let's just split 'em down the middle,
50-50.

233
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,720
Fine, but then that's it, okay?

234
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,600
Come on, then.

235
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,940
It's away from the kids,
so you can stay here as long as you need.

236
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,980
Bit musty, though.

237
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,530
I can't smell anything anyway.

238
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,790
- That music...
- The chapel is right above us.

239
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,210
Yeah, but isn't that Arabic?

240
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,760
The mosque on 39th had a pipe burst,

241
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,800
so we're sharing our space
for a few weeks.

242
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,930
Hell's Kitchen takes care of its own.

243
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,770
This will have to do.

244
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,610
It's also the laundry room,
so it'll be noisy at times.

245
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,320
I can always turn a deaf ear to it.

246
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
See?
There's a bright side to everything.

247
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,410
- I'll need help getting him into bed.
- Yeah.

248
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,410
No, I'd like to stay up a while.

249
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,290
Then I can take it from here, Paul.

250
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,290
Matthew, if you wanna talk...

251
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,710
No. Thank you.

252
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
So...

253
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,050
the bed's right in front of you.

254
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Sister Anne wired you up.

255
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,690
If you press that,
we'll hear you upstairs and come running.

256
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,150
Because we don't have
anything better to do.

257
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,990
Very Christian of you.

258
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,740
Angry, sarcastic... and stubborn.

259
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,290
Maybe you don't have any friends.

260
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,960
Someone once told me
that warriors were meant to be alone.

261
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,130
That caring for people would make me weak.

262
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,840
Sounds like he needed to get laid.

263
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,130
Ha! That actually explains a lot.

264
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,350
I mean, he was right, of course.

265
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,100
I let people in, I paid a price.

266
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,810
I won't make that mistake again.

267
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,890
What is this?

268
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,310
Dug those out of storage.

269
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,030
You were probably
the last one to read 'em.

270
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,740
My Bible.

271
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,080
All right. I get the hint.

272
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,580
And I get the sense things are complicated
with you and the guy upstairs.

273
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,000
No. Not at all.

274
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,720
If anything, I'd say we finally know
where we stand with each other.

275
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,260
"There was a man from the land of Uz..."

276
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,350
Book of Job.

277
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,810
The Book of Job.

278
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,680
The story of God's perfect servant, Job.

279
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,940
He prayed every day at dawn,

280
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,730
with his knees on the ground,
his face in the dirt.

281
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,820
Slaughtered ten goats,
one for each of his children,

282
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,990
and burned them
at the altar in God's honor.

283
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,740
Of all of God's soldiers, Job,
he was the most loyal.

284
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,200
I know the story, Matthew.

285
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,990
Oh. Then you know what happens next.

286
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,000
God murdered all ten of his children
in cold blood.

287
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,210
Scorched every inch of Job's land.

288
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,210
Lashed at his body till his skin
was covered in bloody welts.

289
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,670
God rained shit and misery
on the life of his most perfect servant.

290
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,880
And still... Job would not curse him.

291
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,720
You know what I realized?

292
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,560
Job was a pussy.

293
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,020
You see, that was me, Sister.

294
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,310
I suffered willingly.

295
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,570
I gave my, uh...

296
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,280
sweat and blood and skin
without complaint.

297
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,450
Because I too believed
I was God's soldier.

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,460
Well, not anymore.

299
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,840
I am what I do in the dark now.

300
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,960
I bleed only for myself.

301
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,870
You weren't listening.

302
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,590
I heard every spiteful word.

303
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,970
You might hate God right now,
but the feeling is not mutual.

304
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,720
No, I don't hate him.

305
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,390
I've just seen his true face, is all.

306
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,890
And, for the record, I had friends.
I had a life.

307
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,810
I care about people,

308
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,020
and I'm choosing to let them
believe that I'm gone because I am.

309
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,780
I'm not Job.

310
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,910
And I know my truth now.

311
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,870
What truth?

312
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,460
Well, that in front of this God...

313
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,550
I'd rather die as the Devil
than live as Matt Murdock.

314
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,320
Quiet!

315
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,470
We have good news, Mr. Fisk.

316
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,310
Your appeal is proceeding as discussed.

317
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,480
News.

318
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,020
That implies new information.

319
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,740
Let's start there.

320
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,610
We'll remind you,
we're only the messengers.

321
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,080
We've been doing everything we can
to help her.

322
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,450
But there have been some setbacks
regarding Ms. Marianna's return.

323
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,370
It's going to be
more complicated than we anticipated.

324
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,550
How so?

325
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,680
The federal government has
decided to charge her as an accessory.

326
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,100
If they locate her overseas
or she sets foot on US soil,

327
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,690
she'll face prosecution and prison.

328
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,400
I see.

329
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,620
Leave.

330
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,040
What on earth are you doing?

331
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,170
Falling.

332
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,340
I brought you something.

333
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,760
Is it food? I can't smell anything.

334
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,390
A hot toddy.

335
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,220
It'll help open your sinuses.

336
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
Thank you.

337
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,690
And you need to keep taking these.

338
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,750
Well, it's hot, but... I still can't taste
anything but blood and ash.

339
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,040
Cheers.

340
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,460
Pills and liquor,
modern medicine at its finest.

341
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,840
Easy, smart-ass.

342
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,380
If you want modern medicine,
the door's straight ahead.

343
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,050
- It doesn't matter anyway.
- That's the spirit.

344
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,180
How's the buzzing?

345
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,390
Not getting better.

346
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,890
Give it time.

347
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,100
After the beating you took,
everything's swollen.

348
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,360
Maybe your hearing will come back
when it goes down.

349
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,360
Or maybe it'll come back when you take
your head out of your ass.

350
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,580
How many of these did you have?

351
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,040
What you said...

352
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,460
about rather dying as the Devil
than living as Matt Murdock...

353
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,630
I just want you to know
that I think you're a hero.

354
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,350
Hiding down here,
feeling sorry for yourself.

355
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,850
I mean, just out back,

356
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,480
there's an orphanage full of kids
who've lost everything and everyone.

357
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,560
Some of them are disabled,
much worse off than you ever were.

358
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,690
And they're still trying to make
the most out of life, the little cowards.

359
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,240
Okay. All right.

360
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,530
And here you are,
with all the gifts God gave you.

361
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,080
Handsome, smart, a law degree,
and people who care about you.

362
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,620
And you're bravely giving up.

363
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,500
Well, you know, thank you...

364
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,670
for the tough love, Sister.

365
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,630
And your charmingly simplistic
view of God and the world.

366
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,260
I appreciate everything
you've done for me, I do,

367
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,520
but don't for a second think you know
anything about me or my life.

368
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,770
I've been a nun for 30 years.

369
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,350
I know self-pity when I hear it.

370
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,020
Okay, good.

371
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,730
Your father was famous around here.

372
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,280
I saw him fight.

373
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,950
I saw him go down many times.

374
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,790
But he never stayed down.

375
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Oh.

376
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,660
What in God's name have...

377
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,580
- Feel that?
- Feel what?

378
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,250
Three subway lines run beneath us.

379
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,500
At any given time, there are
six different trains vibrating the ground.

380
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,670
That was the E train.

381
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,840
Was it now?

382
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,260
You brought food.

383
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,720
I did. I brought you some...

384
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,260
Beef ravioli from Nonna's. Nice.

385
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,810
Now you're just showing off.

386
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,360
He wants to know
that he's still got it.

387
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,610
I am not comfortable
with that idea.

388
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,610
Now you're uncomfortable?

389
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,660
Heal the body, and the spirit will follow.

390
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,530
It's the other way around.

391
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,990
He needs this.

392
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,210
It's the only damn thing
that's gotten him out of bed.

393
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,790
So please just do it.

394
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,050
Thanks for making this happen.

395
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,010
Hands should be used for God's work.

396
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,230
- Yeah? That's why he made me this way?
- No. That's why he made boxing.

397
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,520
- Gloves?
- Helmet first.

398
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,190
No, I can't. It'll throw me off.

399
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,740
- Don't be an idiot.
- Sister, listen to me.

400
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,200
For this to work,
I have to feel and hear everything.

401
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,620
Now, remember the deal.
Keep your mouth shut.

402
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,580
Beats the Hail Marys.

403
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,960
You want me to hit a blind guy?

404
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,550
All right.

405
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,320
Cut! Time!

406
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,450
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

407
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,370
Damn. He hits hard.

408
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,290
It's really something.
To see it with my own eyes.

409
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,510
No. Something feels off.
It feels like I'm underwater.

410
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,340
- Maybe we should stop.
- No, no, no.

411
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,720
Ding-ding. Let's go again.

412
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,090
Matthew?

413
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Matthew!

414
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,660
You should see the other guy.

415
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,120
For what it's worth...

416
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,630
you were incredible.

417
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Thank you.

418
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
Sister, I...

419
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,140
Did your head spin around?
Then wear it for me.

420
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,520
You've been very kind to me.

421
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,810
I have, haven't I?

422
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,770
And patient. Very, very patient.

423
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,900
Don't tell anyone.
They'll think I've gone soft.

424
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,280
No. I don't think
there's any danger of that.

425
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,410
Let me look at you.

426
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
I used to sew up my dad.

427
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,670
And your stitches are perfect.

428
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,420
Well, there's plenty of practice
around here.

429
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,180
Everything okay?

430
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,800
Yeah. It's fine.

431
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,560
I just have to get back upstairs.

432
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,490
I don't suppose there's any hope
you'd come to Mass with me?

433
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,490
Maybe next time.

434
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,910
I'll hold you to that.

435
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,590
Hey! Hey, get off of him!
Hey! What are you doing? Dad!

436
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,850
Dad! Hey!

437
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,870
Help! Get off! Help!

438
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,660
Oh, my God! Dad! Dad...

439
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,210
Stay with me.
We'll get you to the hospital.

440
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,610
Come on!

441
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,990
Hey, asshole,
this was none of your business.

442
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,450
Come on.

443
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,940
We should
kill this son of a bitch.

444
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,780
Nah, man. Leave him.

445
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,990
Hold on.

446
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,590
God forgive me.

447
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,880
Leave him. Let's get out of here.

448
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,590
We seriously out of turkey?
You didn't swing by the deli?

449
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,050
I did, actually.

450
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,050
I ran into a little payment snafu
at the register.

451
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,510
I wanted to make it through the party
before I brought it up.

452
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,220
Huh.

453
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,520
Uh, which card did you use?
The red Visa, right?

454
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,440
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Huh.

455
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,060
Hey, Dad.

456
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,480
Hey! There's the birthday goon!

457
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,780
Masi Savina wanted to know
if you're ruining dinner.

458
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,320
Excuse me?

459
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,080
Is she trying to undermine
my culinary talents again?

460
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Get over here.

461
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,210
Let me show you
how a master chef does his thing.

462
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,960
Check this out.

463
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,300
See what I'm doing here, Sami?

464
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,630
This is a technique called "skimming."

465
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,430
High degree of difficulty.

466
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,050
Ta-da!

467
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,310
- Wanna do the honors?
- Yes.

468
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,310
Are you positive
you used the red Visa?

469
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I paid that one last week.
That one should be good.

470
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,570
I tried the red Visa, the blue Visa,
the silver Mastercard...

471
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,780
I even tried my library card.

472
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,000
It's okay.

473
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,000
- Nothing we haven't handled before.
- Hmm.

474
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,120
If I could have the floor
for a minute?

475
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,000
If you haven't heard by now,

476
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,840
despite Nihar shouting it
from the rooftops...

477
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,680
...my courageous sister-in-law
is now 100% cancer-free.

478
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,180
We know that it hasn't been easy for you,

479
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,560
with all the obstacles you've faced.

480
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,650
Being denied insurance
over and over again.

481
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,110
Those asshole institutions
running you over like a tank.

482
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,030
Anyway...

483
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,200
tonight, we celebrate.

484
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,920
This one's for you, Saanvi.
Cheers. Cheers.

485
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,920
We couldn't have done it without you,
brother.

486
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,040
No, please don't.

487
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,380
I'm serious, Ray.

488
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:05,340
You two did the work.
I just wrote a few checks.

489
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,390
What are you doing out here, bug?

490
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,770
Everyone's eaten.
We're waiting to light the candles.

491
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:13,980
I don't think I want any.

492
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:18,150
No cake? He doesn't want any cake.

493
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,320
There must be something
seriously wrong with him.

494
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,900
No, seriously, bug. What's up?

495
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,280
I don't know why we had to have
our family party today.

496
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,530
I told you,
Ricky Thomas is having friends over.

497
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,790
I could be at his house,
glow bowling in his basement right now.

498
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,830
The Thomases have a bowling alley
in their basement?

499
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,080
Let me tell you something.

500
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,130
Come the summer, you're the one
who's gonna be throwing mad parties,

501
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,180
because the pool
is definitely happening this year.

502
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,890
- Really?
- You bet.

503
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,010
I'm gonna be tossing your butt
off the diving board by June.

504
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,770
Now, what do you say we go inside,
throw back some cake?

505
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,850
- Okay.
- Yeah?

506
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,280
- The pool, huh?
- No, don't.

507
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,200
Listen, Nadia said
one of her literacy tutors quit last week.

508
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,740
Maybe I could pick up some evening hours
at the center...

509
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,950
Not another job.
We've been down this road before.

510
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,870
I know, Ray,
but I can't see another way out.

511
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,460
I'll fix this.

512
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,580
I'll fix everything.

513
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:16,930
I've got a nine o'clock with Salazar,
so unless you got something quick...

514
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,730
- Salazar just got called downtown.
- Well, make yourself at home.

515
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,520
Thanks.

516
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:26,860
My performance review.

517
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,110
That's not until
the end of the month, correct?

518
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,780
I'd like it moved up.
I'd like to do it now.

519
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,580
That's a tall order, Ray.

520
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,710
Performance review isn't the kind
of thing we shuffle around.

521
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,580
Then how come mine's
been deferred twice now?

522
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,880
You're denying me
the advancement opportunities

523
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,630
that I have rightfully earned.

524
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,800
No, not the Bureau. You.

525
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,970
Now, why you'd do something like that
to me, I don't have a clue.

526
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,310
But maybe it's time I file a complaint
with the EEO.

527
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,060
You're right.

528
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,190
Your reviews have been deferred

529
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,110
for reasons having nothing to do
with scheduling or restructuring

530
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,820
or whatever bullshit
I fed you at the time.

531
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,780
It's because I'm trying to protect you.

532
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,450
Protect me?

533
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,450
Do you have any idea
what your FICO score is?

534
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:24,040
- 557. Your FICO score is 557.
- So it's not stellar. You know, I...

535
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:28,130
You're buried in debt,
and that makes you a recruitment target.

536
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,300
It's Bureau policy not to promote someone
with that level of vulnerability.

537
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,180
My circumstances were exceptional,
and you know that.

538
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,230
- My sister-in-law was sick and I...
- I am sorry for that.

539
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,770
Three and a half years.

540
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,730
I haven't had a pay bump
in three and a half years.

541
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,190
I know it's wrong.

542
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,450
I know.

543
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,030
You're a fine agent.

544
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:01,200
But I can't make this happen for you.
Not until you fix your finances.

545
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,130
But look...

546
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,590
while I got you here...

547
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,840
your number's up.

548
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,100
Nice. Nice timing.

549
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,970
It's a shit errand. I get it.

550
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,060
We talk to this guy every month,
and every month he gives us nothing.

551
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,850
It's a nice drive, though.

552
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,010
Mr. Fisk, I'm Special Agent Ray Nadeem
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

553
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,050
The FBI would like your assistance with...

554
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,770
Let's cut to the part
where you tell me to eat shit,

555
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,770
so we can stop
wasting each other's time, huh?

556
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:13,190
Tell me, Special Agent Nadeem...

557
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,660
do you have anyone in your life
who you love so much,

558
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,740
you'd do anything to protect them?

559
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,240
Are you threatening me?

560
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,630
I have made many mistakes.

561
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,220
But I accept the debt I'm paying
because of them.

562
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,890
But what I will not accept...

563
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,230
is that the woman that I love
should have to pay for them, too.

564
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,440
I would do anything to protect her.

565
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,030
Anything.

566
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm sorry.

567
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,040
What is it you're saying?

568
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,590
I want to make a deal.
