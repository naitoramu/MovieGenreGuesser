1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:02,622
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,420
Dr. Palmer got
miniaturization to work.

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:14,888
Do it!

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,594
I'm not dead.

5
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:37,010
This is field crew 237,
we're at the Star City Bank.

6
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:39,012
We're under attack!
Immediate assistance!

7
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,994
The Ghosts, they're about to knocking
over the armored cars.

8
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:29,863
Yeah, it's just
like old times.

9
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:45,078
There are guards
in the back.

10
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,680
We'll get 'em. Go!

11
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:57,824
They burned
all the money.

12
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,160
They didn't
need it.

13
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,896
Federal government
sent this to prop up Star City Bank.

14
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:06,032
HIVE just wanted
to make sure that didn't happen.

15
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:10,033

17
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,621
I've heard of having
money to burn,

18
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,722
but stealing money
to burn, that's new.

19
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:16,956
Darhk's not
kidding--

20
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,424
he really wants
this city to die.

21
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,293
Yeah, but why?
I mean, what does HIVE

22
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:22,662
have to gain
from any of this?

23
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,931
A base
of operations.

24
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:27,767
They have to be able to operate
out of somewhere.

25
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,569
What better spot
than a dead city?

26
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:31,571
With almost a dead
police department.

27
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:34,407
Any luck from that tooth we got off
the HIVE member that we took down?

28
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,609
Only that the deterioration
of the DNA markers

29
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:38,477
was most definitely
not natural.

30
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,613
Which means it was
caused by what?

31
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,682
Curtis and I have been trying to figure
that out for the past month.

32
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:43,883
Maybe Ray will
have better luck.

33
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:44,884
I will ask.

34
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:46,652
Hey, you got a sec?

35
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:48,688
Yeah.

36
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:02,735
Where'd you
get this?

37
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:03,836
I got that from Lance.

38
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:05,972
Who got it from Damien Darhk.

39
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:06,854
John, this...

40
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:08,175
Is pretty definitive evidence

41
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,443
that HIVE had Andy killed

42
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:13,613
because his criminal operations
conflicted with theirs.

43
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:16,716
That doesn't track at all with what you
have told me about Andy.

44
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:20,152
Oliver, that doesn't track
with what I knew about Andy.

45
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,621
But...

46
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:23,456
I guess I really
never knew him at all.

47
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,790
There's got to be
some explanation.

48
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,158
Maybe he was
undercover.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,493
Hey, man, listen,
it's all right there.

50
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:28,391
The facts are the facts.

51
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:29,596
All I'm saying,

52
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:30,963
Andy was your brother,

53
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:32,898
and he deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,166
Trust me.

55
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:35,768
Things aren't always
what they seem.

56
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,903
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,707
Reiter's not going
to like this.

58
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,376
Not one bit.

59
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:45,878
Vlad was
a good worker,

60
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,580
and they
listened to him.

61
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,015
Well, I didn't have a choice.

62
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,383
He was going to kill me.

63
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,851
Doesn't sound like
something he'd do.

64
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:55,588
Maybe--maybe he didn't
have a choice, either.

65
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,224
Maybe someone
put him up to it.

66
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,592
Maybe it was
revenge.

67
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,727
Revenge for what?

68
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,362
For Taiana.

69
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:05,865
That drug stealing
bitch you choked out?

70
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,534
Vlad was her brother.

71
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:17,076
Ah, thank you for coming
by on such short notice.

72
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:19,245
Well, happy to have
something to do.

73
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,547
To be honest, I'm feeling
at a bit of a loss

74
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,316
of what to do
with my newfound freedom.

75
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:24,617
And height.

76
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,085
Is everything
always this big?

77
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,253
If you're looking
for something to do,

78
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:29,155
why not try,
oh, I don't know,

79
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:30,990
declare yourself undead, try getting
your company back.

80
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:34,260
You said you had something that
you needed help on?

81
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,561
Don't change the subject.

82
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:36,929
I'm not!

83
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:38,764
I am a recently undead
billionaire CEO.

84
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,099
My time
is at a premium.

85
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,168
What can I do for you?

86
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,605
Thanks, I was wondering
where my tooth went.

87
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,374
John pulled this
off of a Ghost.

88
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,643
It's their cyanide
retirement plan.

89
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:53,512
We tried pulling DNA
off of it, but...

90
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:54,797
But half of the genetic
markers are missing.

91
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:55,916
That's impossible.

92
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,583
You mean like,
"A guy who can

93
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:59,719
shrink to the size
of a French fry" impossible?

94
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,755
Well, do you have any equipment?
I'm fresh out of chromatographs.

95
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:05,391
Got that.

96
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:09,495
Can we circle back to why
you won't come back to Palmer Tech?

97
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,297
Your return is exactly
what our stock price needs.

98
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,032
It's incredible.

99
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:14,934
The genetic code has
been selectively degraded.

100
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,502
We know. We think
it's to scramble the DNA markers

101
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:19,372
so they can't be
IDed. But how?

102
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:22,341
Well, it looks like it was done with
a synthetic compound.

103
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,710
Like a chemical
CRISPR/Cas9.

104
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:26,645
Lastrapium trioxide.

105
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:28,347
Wolfman Biologics
has a patent on it.

106
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:32,651
Thank you.

107
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:34,120
Ok, tomorrow night,

108
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:36,021
Patrolman's Benevolent
Association gala.

109
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:37,490
It's black tie,
so you need a tux.

110
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:39,191
Which one?
He's got like 50.

111
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:40,626
Uh,.

112
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:42,895
Maybe back in the day.
I don't have a tux.

113
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:45,431
Get a rental. Doesn't really matter.
Every mayor in the history

114
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,666
of Star City has
attended the PBA.

115
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:49,702
I secured a spot for you
on the dais with the brass,

116
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:51,771
but we need to make sure
that your keynote is on point.

117
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:53,773
Which means, we need
to find a way to say that the police

118
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,641
need our help
without...

119
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:56,653
Throwing them under the bus.

120
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:58,545
Right.

121
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:00,946
I thought you failed
civics class.

122
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,082
A D-minus,
thank you.

123
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:06,185
Alex has a way
of making this interesting.

124
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:12,391
Sorry, uh,
wrong number.

125
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:13,993
What were we saying?

126
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,328
Um, moving on
to Oliver's platform.

127
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,564
I got your email
about cleaning up Star City Bay.

128
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,666
Yes!

129
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,835
You know, with everything
this city's facing right now,

130
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,503
a hippie, crunchy
program like--

131
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:27,873
A hippie, crunchy program that will
add hundreds of jobs,

132
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,675
help gentrify the surrounding
neighborhoods,

133
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,377
and encourage
outside investment.

134
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,645
And put voters to sleep.

135
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:33,712
We need to focus
on crime and jobs.

136
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:37,049
Which this program
will address.

137
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:39,418
Hey, I will put out
a press release tomorrow.

138
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,359
I got to take this.

139
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,695
Ok.

140
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:47,493
I think your brother's onto us.

141
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:49,695
No. No, and even
if he was,

142
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:51,764
it's not like he's
the boss of me.

143
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,999
No, he's the boss of me.

144
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:54,786
I know.

145
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,570
I'm just glad
your brother's not a killer.

146
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,137
Oh...
Speedy!

147
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,140
Speedy, um--

148
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:03,709
Thea. Sorry, it's a nickname.
We have to go.

149
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,778
Felicity called
about the thing.

150
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,046
The dental problem.

151
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,381
Uh, yes,
yeah, sorry.

152
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:11,250
Um, our--our friend
has, this, uh,

153
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:12,852
tooth issue.

154
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:13,565
Yeah.

155
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:15,589
Good work.

156
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:25,798
Onsite.

157
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,366
We're clear
for entry.

158
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:32,137
All right,
Felicity, what's next?

159
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,572
We need a sample
of the chemical.

160
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:35,875
With it, Ray can unscramble
the DNA markers

161
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,676
and we can have
a shot at IDing

162
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:38,844
some of our Ghosts.

163
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,346
Where do we find this thing?

164
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:43,415
According to their recently
hacked computers,

165
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,583
second floor,
northwest corner.

166
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:47,286
It's a yellow liquid.

167
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,121
Incoming.

168
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,524
Four Ghosts,
north entrance.

169
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,459
I'm on it.

170
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,507
Looks good,
we're in.

171
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,376
Looking for the compound.

172
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,286
Got it.

173
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:26,625
Green Arrow and Speedy
need assistance.

174
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:27,793
Thanks!

175
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:28,994
You should go,
get out of here.

176
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,062
And what about you?

177
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,298
I've got this. Go.

178
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,213
Felicity, I'm going for an ID
on the Ghost that shot at us.

179
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,137
Stand by.

180
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:47,629
Andy?

181
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:05,157
Well, even death's
not permanent anymore.

182
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,492
Sorry.

183
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,726
No, no, it's ok.

184
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:09,595
Nothing seems
to make sense anymore.

185
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,430
Andy.

186
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:12,456
I can't
believe this.

187
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:14,090
Ok, it's obvious that
HIVE faked his death.

188
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:15,392
Maybe it was part
of his recruitment--

189
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:17,160
You saw the file.
You saw what kind of

190
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:18,962
man my brother was,
what kind of man he is.

191
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:20,630
We don't know anything,

192
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:22,265
not until we hear it
directly from Andy.

193
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:23,767
And how are we
supposed to do that?

194
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,771
We get him out of HIVE.

195
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:25,736
Oliver, how are you

196
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:27,470
still giving him
the benefit of the doubt?

197
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:28,772
Because he's your family.

198
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:30,240
You said he was a good man.

199
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:31,308
Maybe a part of him still is.

200
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:32,276
I don't know.

201
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:33,677
I do. Last month
at the lumber yard,

202
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,745
a Ghost had a chance
to kill you, but didn't.

203
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,581
I remember thinking how weird that was,
unless that Ghost was Andy.

204
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,283
So, what, he had
a chance to kill me and he didn't,

205
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:42,218
so I'm just supposed to forget
he's a killer?

206
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,154
No, but you should
still remember he's your brother.

207
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:45,755
I can't square
that circle, Thea.

208
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:48,792
That HIVE member
was nothing like my brother.

209
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:50,527
The man that was
my brother's dead.

210
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,362
He's dead.

211
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:58,101
What brother?

212
00:09:58,103 --> 00:09:59,636
The brother of the prisoner
that stole the drugs,

213
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:02,405
but only because
he put him up to it.

214
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:03,514
You're crazy!

215
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:05,370
That prisoner attacked you
'cause what you did to his sister--

216
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,904
That's a lie!

217
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,372
It's a hell of a lot
more believable

218
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,107
than me putting him up
to attacking you.

219
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,475
You know what,
you have had it in for me

220
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,043
ever since you
found that knap--

221
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,712
Enough! I have a means of

222
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,914
divining the truth.

223
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,685
Why did you kill
that prisoner?

224
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,055
Because he attacked me.

225
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,802
Aww, come on, man,
this isn't the place

226
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,441
for your hocus pocus crap!

227
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,462
Did you have that prisoner
attack Mr. Queen?

228
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,963
Hell no.

229
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,368
You're lying.

230
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,370
According to what,
a bunch of twigs?

231
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,839
Reiter, don't do this!
You got to hear me out!

232
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,607
It's him!
He's the problem.

233
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,676
He's the problem! Hey!

234
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,311
What are you going
to do to him?

235
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,248
Nothing. I believe the wrong should
make things right.

236
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,258
So, you wanted to see me.

237
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,227
So polite. That's
a bit atypical.

238
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,996
A guy gets slapped down enough times,
he learns who's boss.

239
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,965
Apparently not.

240
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,767
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

241
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,105
After our meeting last week, I had
an unpleasant encounter

242
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,541
with the Green Arrow
and his compatriots.

243
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,144
My security personnel
are under the opinion

244
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,979
that you called
that meeting so as

245
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,615
to create an opportunity
to have me followed.

246
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,751
So your security guys don't trust me,
but what about you?

247
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,987
Trust is an orchid--

248
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,423
beautiful
but delicate.

249
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,427
Requiring ideal
conditions in order to thrive.

250
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,529
Without those
conditions,

251
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,698
it dies.

252
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,869
Tread carefully,
Quinton.

253
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,305
Believe it or not,
the death of your daughter

254
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,740
is not the most
terrible thing

255
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,342
that I can
threaten you with.

256
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,562
I don't want
to talk to you.

257
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,263
Then why are you
answering the phone?

258
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,333
Because, I...

259
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,371
I would have
told you I was stopping by,

260
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,639
but you weren't
taking my calls.

261
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,041
What do you want?

262
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,010
To help you.

263
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,778
Those men you killed
in Nanda Parbat,

264
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,114
the effects of
those deaths must be

265
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:30,926
wearing off by now.

266
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,416
I'm fine.

267
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,151
The blood lust
has returned, hasn't it?

268
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,186
I have it under control.

269
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,089
You can't
control it, Thea.

270
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,894
Who's Lawrence Tanner?

271
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,797
A Pedophile.
Multiple accusations,

272
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,965
no convictions.

273
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,767
Lives three
blocks down.

274
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,368
The world needs
one less pedophile.

275
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,104
And you need
at least a month of peace.

276
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,540
Look, I'm going to go out, ok?

277
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,243
And when I come home,
you better not still be here,

278
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,812
or I am calling the police.

279
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,488
Hey.

280
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,726
Alex hired a security detail,
if you want to sit this one out.

281
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,928
Yeah, I'm going
to be at the bar.

282
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,298
Well, this is actually a better way
than how you usually spend your evenings--

283
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,501
dressing in leather
and tying people up.

284
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,503
There he is!

285
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,971
They're waiting
for you on the dais.

286
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,773
You ready for this?

287
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,842
About to find out.

288
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,980
Evening.

289
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:41,118
It is our great
privilege to be here tonight

290
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,520
to honor the Star City
Police Department.

291
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,689
These are a group
of men and women

292
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,525
who risk their lives
for us on a daily basis.

293
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,427
Never been an easy job,

294
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,329
and it has certainly never
been more difficult

295
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,431
than it is right
now in our city.

296
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,867
These are the people
that keep our streets safe;

297
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,635
who watch over us.

298
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,370
They protect us.

299
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,306
For that, I'm grateful.

300
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,675
And so is the rest
of Star City.

301
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,686
Not bad.
Not quite as powerful

302
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,354
as the Green Arrow's,
but not bad.

303
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,390
Yeah? Maybe I should
get him to endorse me.

304
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,026
I need a favor from you.

305
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,362
Need a location of one
of Darhk's foot soldiers.

306
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,930
Could be
a little difficult.

307
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,699
Darhk called me
into his office this morning

308
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,967
for a little chat about how he doesn't
trust me anymore.

309
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,835
Wait, wait, wait,
are you in danger?

310
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,338
I hope not.
But listen,

311
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,106
when I was there,
I saw something on his desk.

312
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,376
Something about
slip 52 down at the docks.

313
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,278
Now, if the Ghosts
are there,

314
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,980
maybe the one you're looking for
will be there, too.

315
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:43,733
Ok. Thank you.

316
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,483
All right.

317
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,751
Hey, honey.
How are you?

318
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,388
Thank you.

319
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,190
Club soda.

320
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,526
Yeah, it has to be.

321
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,394
Can't have the candidate's
bodyguard getting hammered.

322
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,197
Do you want
to talk about?

323
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,732
Resurrected siblings

324
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,101
are kind of in
my wheelhouse.

325
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,271
It's not quite
the same thing, Laurel.

326
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,073
Sara wasn't really--

327
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,744
A member of an organization
of killers?

328
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,546
I'm sure there are
a million things

329
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,714
going through your head right now.
All I'm saying is,

330
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,082
make one of them

331
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,717
an appreciation
for the fact

332
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,920
that your brother
is actually alive.

333
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,389
Well, I--why, so I can...

334
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,025
Hold off some
kind of false hope

335
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,360
that he might be decent?
He doesn't deserve that.

336
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,262
No, he probably
doesn't, but you do.

337
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,566
After Andy died,
a part of you died, too.

338
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,635
And now, now is
your chance to heal.

339
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,805
How am I supposed to do that?

340
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,273
When I had to look...

341
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,076
my nephew in the eye

342
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,314
and tell him that...

343
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,649
He was never going to see
his daddy again...

344
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,024
The months after Andy died
were the darkest times of my life.

345
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,793
I would have given anything,

346
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,495
anything to get Andy back.

347
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,298
I would have
sacrificed my life

348
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,234
to have him back

349
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:14,071
with his wife
and his son.

350
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,974
I would have traded
my life for a stranger.

351
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,413
Mr. Queen, it's so nice to meet you.

352
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,120
Thank you!

353
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,247
Do you think you can

354
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,314
get more funding
for the SCPD?

355
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,554
Well, that's certainly
a top priority.

356
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:26,612
That's great news.

357
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:27,385
Sure.
Thank you.

358
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,220
Mr. Queen. Huge fan.

359
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,322
Thank you. Mr.?

360
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,658
Darhk. I have some ideas

361
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,126
of how I might contribute
to your campaign.

362
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:36,896
Do you have a minute?

363
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,028
Of course.

364
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,498
Well, it's not just
about financial support.

365
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,515
I have strong relations
in the business circles,

366
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:44,755
media outlets as well.

367
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,137
That's all well and good,

368
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,871
but I am running unopposed.

369
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,207
So I don't totally understand
how you can help me win.

370
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,409
Oh, it's not
about winning.

371
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,845
It's about how much we can accomplish
if we worked together.

372
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,879
Right.

373
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,281
And not to be
indelicate,

374
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,849
but a lot has
changed in Star City

375
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,384
since your parents
held sway here.

376
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,519
The levers of power
have changed.

377
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,422
And not understanding that is
what doomed Jessica Danforth's bid.

378
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,124
Hmm.

379
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,126
What do you want,
Mr. Darhk?

380
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,461
I read the press release about
your new project.

381
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,797
The restoration
of Starling Bay.

382
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,667
Reconsider your plans.
Leave the Bay as it is.

383
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,368
What if I refuse?

384
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,706
Oh, well, then you'll no longer
be unopposed.

385
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,708
Mr. Queen.

386
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,943
Mr. Darhk.

387
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,809
Leaving to fight
Ra's on the mountaintop,

388
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,511
going undercover
with the League of Assassins,

389
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:38,779
dating the Huntress...

390
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:40,481
What are you doing?
Oh...

391
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:42,283
I am just listing
all of the terrible ideas

392
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:43,584
you've had over
the past three years,

393
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,019
of which throwing in
with Damien Darhk

394
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,420
has got to be the worst.

395
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,589
I am not throwing in
with Damien Darhk!

396
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:50,858
I am using him
to get at HIVE.

397
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
Isn't Lance already
our man on the inside?

398
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,261
Lance has lost
Darhk's trust,

399
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:55,629
making this
the only way...

400
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:57,064
To get yourself killed.

401
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,066
You remember the last time

402
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:01,702
you tried to take down
an evil organization from the inside?

403
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:02,457
This is different.

404
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,238
Why?

405
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,543
Because you'd be doing it
as Oliver Queen?

406
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,373
Yep.

407
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:07,174
What about
your mayoral campaign?

408
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:09,810
You cannot be an effective
candidate for mayor

409
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,378
and Darhk's undercover stooge.

410
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,847
Ahem. Taking down Darhk
is more important,

411
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:17,618
especially now that we know
he has Andy under his thumb.

412
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,231
First, there is a whole
long list of things that

413
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:21,156
we don't know about Andy.

414
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:22,589
Second, you didn't
decide to run for mayor

415
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,291
to take down Darhk.

416
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,226
You did it to give the city
something that the Green Arrow

417
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:27,828
can't give them--

418
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,664
Hope. Inspiration.

419
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,067
Don't lose sight of that.

420
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,369
Not even for John.

421
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,917
This man betrayed us.

422
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,518
He sent an innocent man,

423
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,721
a useful man
to his grave.

424
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:56,357
He conspired
against me, you,

425
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,359
all of his brothers.

426
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,827
Baron, please...

427
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:01,562
His punishment
won't come from me,

428
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,897
but from the one
he sought to hurt.

429
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:12,239
Oliver, please.

430
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,941
Don't do this.

431
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:16,276
I'm begging you.

432
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,312
Come on, Queen.

433
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,218
Please. Look, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry for everything!

434
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:29,223
Please don't do this!

435
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,129
Aah!

436
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,731
Harder!

437
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:41,235
Aah!

438
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,471
Aah!

439
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,977
So--so, I'm sorry,

440
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:51,645
your friend was reunited
with his brother

441
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,614
after eight years?

442
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:55,349
It's crazy, right?

443
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:57,418
Yeah, crazy.

444
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,220
So you have you, uh,
given him your crown yet?

445
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,289
I mean, you held
the record with five years

446
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,258
thinking Oliver was dead, so.

447
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:09,296
I can't imagine how tough it must have
been for you, Thea.

448
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,665
Sorry.

449
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:14,635
You know, I should
probably take this.

450
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:16,003
Ok.

451
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:17,971
This is Alex. Sorry.

452
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,107
Yeah, what's up?

453
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:22,276
Hi there.

454
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:25,145
What are you drinking?
Maybe I can buy you another.

455
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:27,881
I don't think my date would
like that very much.

456
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,316
Well, I don't see him here.

457
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:30,651
You look like
the kind of girl

458
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:32,519
where no means yes.

459
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,388
Come on, baby.

460
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:44,865
Thea! Stop!

461
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:49,303
What the hell
are you doing?

462
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,214
Can't do it?

463
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:04,651
I can't believe
that Andy's back.

464
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:11,024
How am I supposed
to tell Carly?

465
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:13,260
She has a right
to know, Johnny.

466
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:15,028
She's better off
thinking he's dead.

467
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,864
I'm not sure that's
your call to make.

468
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,966
I'm not sure
about anything.

469
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:23,770
You know, when I first found out
about the Flash,

470
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:27,140
and the Lazarus Pit
and what it did for Thea...

471
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:31,378
I began to daydream
about Andy being back.

472
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:36,416
I would just play
with that idea.

473
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:39,453
My brother's back.

474
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:44,858
I never thought
it would actually happen.

475
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,027
I know.

476
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:53,066
I'll get it.

477
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,330
Hi, Lyla.

478
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:00,642
Hi, Oliver.

479
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:01,975
May I come in?

480
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:03,777
Sure.

481
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:10,984
I'll, um, give
you two a minute.

482
00:22:15,424 --> 00:22:17,925
How you holding up?

483
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:20,627
Ah, I guess as good as
can be expected, right?

484
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:23,063
Nothing really
to compare this to.

485
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:25,265
At least not this week.

486
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:26,967
Ahh.

487
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:28,837
Lance has some Intel for us.

488
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:29,338
Hmm?

489
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:31,372
Slip 52 at the docks.

490
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:32,639
Felicity checked it out,
and that whole area's

491
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:34,241
been shut down
for the entire night.

492
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:35,676
Think the Ghosts
have something planned there?

493
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:36,977
And maybe your brother.

494
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,679
Every time
we face the Ghosts,

495
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:41,448
it's Russian Roulette.
I'm not risking any of you for Andy.

496
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,116
You're not.
We're offering.

497
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:45,452
Ok. But just us.

498
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:47,321
Thea and Laurel
sit this one out.

499
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:49,222
Ok.

500
00:22:56,332 --> 00:23:01,802
Gentlemen, you all come
here from different walks,

501
00:23:01,804 --> 00:23:03,403
different paths.

502
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:06,573
But all burdened
with the same knowledge--

503
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:09,409
that this world
is diseased.

504
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:13,046
Fortunately, there is a cure
for this pestilence.

505
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,617
That cure, gentlemen,

506
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,151
is HIVE.

507
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:20,354
Those little yellow
pills you swallowed,

508
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:22,823
they do a few
interesting things--

509
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:25,726
including making you
cooperative.

510
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:29,396
Now, I understand you all volunteered
and that's just swell.

511
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:32,432
But I think we can all agree that in
any chain of command,

512
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:35,869
there can never be
too much compliance.

513
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:40,974
Perhaps a demonstration.

514
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:43,677
Kneel.

515
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,151
The people
of this city--

516
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:53,754
what's left of them,
at any rate--

517
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:58,525
they call you Ghosts.

518
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:01,862
And they have no idea
how right they are.

519
00:24:01,864 --> 00:24:03,630
Up there!

520
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:07,501
Kill the green one.

521
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:10,100
This isn't on you,
John, it was my call.

522
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,936
Ahem. I never should have
let you make it.

523
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:15,139
Felicity, can you
give us a second?

524
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,541
No, I think I should stay.

525
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,443
I just, uh, remembered,

526
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:23,647
I got that thing in the whatever
with the what's-it.

527
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,716
Oliver,
let this go, man.

528
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:28,118
I have.

529
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,820
You almost got
yourself killed.

530
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:32,450
I've been a lot
closer to almost killed.

531
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:33,641
Andy made his choice.

532
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,627
You don't know that.

533
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:37,928
John, you saw what was
going on tonight.

534
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,631
Those men, they were
under the influence of something.

535
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:42,833
Whatever pill
is scrambling their DNA

536
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:45,135
is also making them
susceptible to Darhk suggestion.

537
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:47,471
All right, just because
you have a blind spot for your family,

538
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:48,806
don't expect me
to, as well.

539
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,140
That--that's not
what this is about.

540
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:51,308
The hell it's not.

541
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,811
Family is exactly
what this is about.

542
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,345
Criminal or not.

543
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,915
Under the influence
or not.

544
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,451
Andy let his son and his wife
believe he was dead

545
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:02,553
for eight years,
Oliver.

546
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:04,555
Eight years!

547
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:06,557
And there's no
excuse for that.

548
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,392
None.

549
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:10,427
John, I'm just--
you don't know.

550
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:12,529
Oliver, you don't know.
You have this inexplicable way

551
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,565
of excusing everything just
because it's family.

552
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:17,468
It's not inexplicable!
I'm asking you--

553
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,370
ahem. I'm asking you
to hold out hope for Andy,

554
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,339
because I need that hope.

555
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,308
I need to believe

556
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,376
that no matter what
happens in our lives,

557
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,046
no matter how much
darkness infects us,

558
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:32,316
I need to believe that we can
come back from that!

559
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:35,452
And it was exactly that thinking that
led you to the League last year.

560
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:39,056
Doesn't seem like you learned
much from that.

561
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:40,557
Felicity told you?

562
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,059
Getting in bed
with Darhk, Oliver?

563
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:44,294
I don't see how
you can even consider it.

564
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,467
We are going
to take this guy down,

565
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:52,703
and no idea is off the table.

566
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:55,239
I thought you're doing things
differently, Oliver.

567
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:56,874
Fighting Darhk
from the inside

568
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,710
is just fighting Darhk
in the shadows.

569
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,413
You want to do things differently?
You want ideas, fine.

570
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:07,417
Let's take this son of a bitch down
in the light of day.

571
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,494
Hey.

572
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:18,662
Just in time.

573
00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:20,664
For what?

574
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:23,300
Ah, roasted lizard

575
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,402
with a little bit
of coriander and sea salt.

576
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:27,905
I've gotten better at removing the skin
with a sharp rock.

577
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,240
I ate already.

578
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:33,043
Thank you.

579
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:38,916
Are you all right?

580
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:42,419
It's a hard day.

581
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:43,854
Taiana...

582
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:46,890
I have to...

583
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:50,027
I have to tell you
something about your brother.

584
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:52,196
Vlad?

585
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:55,032
Is he all right?

586
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:56,934
No.

587
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,002
I'm sorry.

588
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:00,571
What do you mean?

589
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:01,576
Is he--

590
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,174
Taiana...

591
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:04,775
I'm very sorry.

592
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:13,266
Hey.

593
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,319
Hey.

594
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,487
Sorry, I had Curtis
grab some more toys

595
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,590
so I could keep
working on your tooth.

596
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:22,426
That's ok; I don't think we're going
to be using the table

597
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:24,361
for eating tonight,
anyway.

598
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:26,463
Oliver and John
are busy fighting over

599
00:28:26,465 --> 00:28:29,566
John's not-so-dead
after all brother.

600
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,134
Do I even want to ask?

601
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:33,203
Let's just say you no longer
corner the market

602
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:34,705
on not being dead
as people think.

603
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:35,973
Though, in John's
brother's case,

604
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,407
he does have
a pretty good excuse--

605
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:39,042
unlike some people.

606
00:28:39,044 --> 00:28:41,745
Have you seen
anyone?

607
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:43,614
Of course not; I've been busy here
working on your tooth.

608
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,549
You're stalling. Ray, when you come
back from the dead,

609
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,984
you're supposed to
start living again.

610
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,653
What's going on?

611
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:52,022
I've been catching up
on the past six months.

612
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:55,125
My company, my city, my life.

613
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:58,562
And I feel like Tom Sawyer watching
his own funeral.

614
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:00,564
Except in my case,
nobody really cares.

615
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,366
That is not
true, Ray.

616
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:04,501
Renaming Starling
Star City is nice,

617
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:07,571
but then take a look
to what's happened to the place.

618
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:10,307
And my company,
this thing I've built

619
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:11,575
that was supposed
to outlast me,

620
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:13,176
is now on life support.

621
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:15,545
Because it needs you.

622
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,847
To do what?

623
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:19,049
The same thing I was doing
before I died?

624
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:21,084
Obviously that didn't
amount to anything.

625
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:22,853
Oh, self-pity is not
a good look on you.

626
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:24,521
Ah, I don't think
it's self-pity.

627
00:29:24,523 --> 00:29:26,490
I think it's self-reflection.

628
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:29,493
If I'm going
to come back to life,

629
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:32,596
I have to figure out
what it is that I'm living for.

630
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:35,165
Ok.

631
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:38,535
I played around
with your bicuspid a bit.

632
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:40,904
Ah, the, uh, compound
definitely broke down

633
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,673
the residual DNA
on the tooth.

634
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:44,708
It's pretty inventive,
actually.

635
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,910
Is there any way to
reconstitute the DNA

636
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,246
so we have a shot
at IDing these guys?

637
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,214
No. Once the alleles
are decomposed,

638
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:52,138
they're gone for good.

639
00:29:52,162 --> 00:29:53,117
Yeah.

640
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:54,751
So since that was a dead end,

641
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,253
I took another look
at the polymer

642
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,621
the fake tooth was made of.

643
00:29:57,623 --> 00:30:01,124
Uh, I found faint traces
of sodium fluoride.

644
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:02,559
Like from water?

645
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,261
There's no way that
the concentration

646
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,530
could be high enough to leave behind
any sort of residue.

647
00:30:06,532 --> 00:30:08,298
It would if there was
an unusually high

648
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,900
sodium fluoride count
in the drinking water,

649
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:13,070
like say in the facility
that was closed down

650
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,806
for that very reason.

651
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,941
Muller Psychiatric
Center.

652
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,743
You got to admire the irony

653
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:21,745
of Damien Darhk keeping
his army of bad guys

654
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:23,613
in a defunct looney bin.

655
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:28,085
Not bad for a guy who thinks
his life didn't add up to anything.

656
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:33,623
Never going to
outlive that one.

657
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,359
Everyone clear on the plan?

658
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:37,761
You know, I wasn't
the first 80 times we went over it,

659
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:40,430
but now I think
I got it.

660
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,733
What's going on, guys?

661
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:44,601
Felicity found
a probable location

662
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:46,937
for the Ghosts'
base of operations.

663
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:48,343
These guys are not going
to be easy to take out.

664
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:49,249
How are you feeling?

665
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:53,043
We're not trying to take down the Ghosts;
We don't have the manpower.

666
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:55,946
Going after Andy.

667
00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:59,249
Guys, Oliver nearly got himself killed
trying to help Andy.

668
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:00,984
I'm not letting you
do the same.

669
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:04,187
I'm sorry, but it's not
really just up to you.

670
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:05,956
I did everything
that I could

671
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,290
to bring
my sister back,

672
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,525
and I think your brother
deserves the same.

673
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,093
No, Laurel,

674
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:11,828
that's just it--
I don't think he does.

675
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,463
And I don't know
what Oliver told you--

676
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:15,932
He told them the only two things
that matter--

677
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:17,167
Andy's under
Darhk's influence,

678
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,368
and we need
to get him out.

679
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,003
I can't let you
risk your life

680
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,505
for someone who
does not deserve it.

681
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:24,307
That's your call.
But we've made ours.

682
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,143
Let's move.

683
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:40,658
We're onsite.

684
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:42,626
Oh, satellite's reading a hell
of a lot of activity

685
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:44,227
for 3:00 in the morning.
I'm guessing 50 or so Ghosts

686
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:45,896
plus who knows
how many recruits.

687
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:47,197
Hey, wait, if the Ghosts
are wearing

688
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,832
their usual
Halloween costume,

689
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,234
then how are we supposed to tell
which one's Andy?

690
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:53,436
That's what your fancy
new cameras are for.

691
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:55,872
A little gift from Curtis.

692
00:31:57,052 --> 00:32:00,122
Infrared lenses should virtually
unmask our ghosty friends.

693
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:01,422
Sick.

694
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:03,758
Ok, ready?

695
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:10,498
I'm in position.

696
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,700
In position.

697
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,940
This isn't just
a base of operations.

698
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:20,642
It looks like a staging area.

699
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:21,237
For what?

700
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:22,077
Equipment.

701
00:32:22,078 --> 00:32:25,280
Military crates marked G6:5.

702
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:27,048
Does that mean anything?

703
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,316
Maybe they're
playing bingo.

704
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:29,651
Let's assume that's not it.

705
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:30,752
Deadly bingo.

706
00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:33,021
Ahem. We need to get
an ID on Andy.

707
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:35,657
When we do, you wait
for my signal before engaging.

708
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:38,126
Yeah, I might not
have that option.

709
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:39,894
Speedy?

710
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,796
She's been spotted, third floor,
southwest building.

711
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:44,932
I've been spotted,
too.

712
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:02,717
I might be able
to get a visual on our target!

713
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:07,855
Waiting on confirmation.

714
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,695
That's him, you got him,
the one on your right.

715
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:17,031
Actually, he's got
me!

716
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,443
I got him. He looks heavy,
I need help in here.

717
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:04,312
I'm on my way.

718
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:21,195
It's Merida.

719
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:24,999
Aren't you out a little bit
past your bedtime?

720
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:30,505
I've seen something
of your fighting style.

721
00:34:30,507 --> 00:34:33,541
You were trained
by Ra's al Ghul.

722
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:36,644
Tell me--how is Malcolm
doing these days?

723
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,418
That usually works.

724
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:03,738
Black Canary's got Andy,
but she needs help reaching the exfil.

725
00:35:08,082 --> 00:35:09,422
I got this!

726
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:10,346
Are you sure?

727
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,370
Go!

728
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:26,275
It's, uh, nice
of you to show up.

729
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:28,710
My brother
needed me.

730
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,946
The green one.

731
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:39,695
Thank you,
thank you,

732
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:41,597
thank you, all of you.

733
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,065
Palmer, even you,
thank you.

734
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:45,067
My pleasure.
Feels good to do

735
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,936
something useful.
It's been a while.

736
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,771
Does that mean I can expect
to see you at work tomorrow?

737
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,306
Ah...No.

738
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:51,907
Can't keep doing

739
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,876
the same useless,
ineffective things.

740
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:55,778
You know? I got to
do something different.

741
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,380
I'm going to take some time
and figure out what that is.

742
00:35:58,382 --> 00:36:02,551
But, uh, it still include the occasional
super heroics whenever you need me.

743
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,021
Where are you going?

744
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:09,224
Well, I have
a long overdue chat

745
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:11,427
with my brother.
I hope you were right.

746
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:12,991
Me, too.

747
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:13,733
You were right.

748
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,031
About what?

749
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:16,999
Darhk. I thought
about what you said,

750
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:19,835
and how to fight him.
I'm going to do it in the light of day.

751
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,737
Good. What did you have in mind?

752
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,472
You'll see.

753
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:31,046
We never should
have gotten on that damn boat!

754
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:34,416
Reiter's men hijacked the yacht
that we were working on.

755
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,487
I was a dive instructor

756
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:41,724
and Vlad was
the deckhand.

757
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:43,492
They killed everyone
on our charter

758
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:44,960
and they
brought us here.

759
00:36:44,962 --> 00:36:47,963
What happened?

760
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,465
With Vlad?

761
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,066
Conklin.

762
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:53,535
I'll kill him,
that monster!

763
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:55,170
Taiana, wait, wait.

764
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,606
I'm going to kill him
for what he did!

765
00:36:57,608 --> 00:37:00,809
Conklin is--
is terrible,

766
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:02,878
but he's not
the problem.

767
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,113
He's just a pawn.

768
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:05,614
Pawn for what?

769
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:07,750
For Reiter's plan.

770
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,253
What is this?

771
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:13,489
This is a map
of Lian Yu,

772
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:15,524
and I think
that it leads

773
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:18,160
to whatever Reiter
is looking for.

774
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:20,162
Can you follow it?

775
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:22,197
Not without a...

776
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,967
detailed survey map
of the island.

777
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:28,470
Where would we get
something like that?

778
00:37:28,472 --> 00:37:31,040
Well, I had an idea.

779
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,342
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

780
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:35,844
To get there,
I'll need your help.

781
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,986
Thank you for coming.

782
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:46,955
Are you sure you
don't have the SCPD

783
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:48,724
waiting for me
in the kitchen?

784
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:51,160
Don't be so paranoid.

785
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:54,730
You did threaten me
with arrest

786
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,698
the last time
I popped by.

787
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:01,970
So...

788
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:03,939
Did you reconsider
my advice?

789
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:05,407
Yes.

790
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:08,944
And I'm still not
going to take it.

791
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:12,047
Look...I think I might have found
a different way

792
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:14,349
for me to control
my blood lust,

793
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:17,252
one that does not include
killing people.

794
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:20,622
What does it
include?

795
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:22,191
Damien Darhk.

796
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:29,264
Last night,
we went after HIVE,

797
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,667
and I ran into Damien.

798
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:35,337
I've seen what he can
do with his powers,

799
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,539
but when he tried
to use them on me,

800
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:40,809
it completely backfired.

801
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:43,912
And my blood lust was gone.

802
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:46,115
I mean, at least
for a little while.

803
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:49,084
So what I want
is for you to help me

804
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,620
figure out a way
to make that permanent.

805
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:09,638
Andy, I don't even
know where to begin.

806
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:16,545
Andy, I need
to understand.

807
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:18,113
Can you help me
understand?

808
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:21,483
Is what's in
this file true?!

809
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:25,154
Andy, answer me.

810
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
It's true.

811
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:47,910
All of it.

812
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:09,298
Well, this is quite
a lot of media

813
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,800
for a, uh,
what'd you call it?

814
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:12,785
Hippie, crunchy program.

815
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:13,970
That's right.

816
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:16,438
Always happy to admit
when I'm wrong.

817
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,424
Good luck up there.

818
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,448
Thank you.

819
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:24,046
Ok, sorry I'm late.

820
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,414
Ah, you're fine.

821
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:27,182
We're just getting started.

822
00:40:27,184 --> 00:40:28,817
So, I...

823
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:32,521
Haven't been
arrested for battery yet.

824
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:34,189
I keep thinking...

825
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:35,657
You would have killed him

826
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,192
if I hadn't stopped you.

827
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:39,695
I just had
a really bad night.

828
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:42,331
I guess I'm
just asking if

829
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,433
maybe you could be
a little patient...

830
00:40:44,435 --> 00:40:46,235
with me.

831
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:52,040
Thank you all for coming.

832
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:53,709
My, uh,

833
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:55,944
my campaign advisor

834
00:40:55,946 --> 00:40:58,914
doesn't think that saving the Bay
is the right fight

835
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,183
given the state
the city is in.

836
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:03,418
But I'd like everyone
to know that I'm not blind

837
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,255
to Star City's problems.

838
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:08,890
And I wouldn't
be here today

839
00:41:08,892 --> 00:41:12,728
if I wasn't confident that this program
could help solve them.

840
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,196
And the reason
I chose the Bay

841
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:17,366
is because it's in
the center of the city.

842
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:20,068
It's out in the open.

843
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,371
For everyone to see.

844
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:25,073
The fight
to save Star City

845
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:27,709
isn't going to be
fought in the shadows.

846
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,578
It's going to be fought
in the light of day.

847
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,147
And I promise you,

848
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:34,216
all of you,

849
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:37,919
that I will never stop fighting
to save this city.

850
00:41:37,921 --> 00:41:40,289
We love you!

852
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:06,205
Greg!
Move your head.
