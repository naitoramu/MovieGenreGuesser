1
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:16,006
The hacker is on the ninth floor.

2
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:18,091
Move quickly. Quietly.

3
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,260
When we are done,
we bring the boss all ten fingers.

4
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:21,344
Questions?

5
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,325
Hungry?

6
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:15,936
Mmm.

7
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,688
Come on, that's enough.
You've eaten enough. Talk.

8
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:20,065
Warm that up for you?

9
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:26,321
Pie?

10
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:28,115
Don't tell me you're watching your figure.

11
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,992
- We just fought the Yakuza.
- And won!

12
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:33,620
You might've mentioned the Japanese mafia
before butterfly knives started flying.

13
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:36,248
- I told you I needed help, no?
- You said you needed a lawyer.

14
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:38,291
- I lied.
- Yeah, no shit.

15
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,002
You've been lying since you got here.

16
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,753
And that ends now.

17
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:44,131
I want to know
what you're doing back here,

18
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:46,049
what's happening with the Yakuza...

19
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,928
And I wanna know how you know...

20
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:55,392
I wanna know how you know about me.

21
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:58,103
I know who you are
because I watch the news.

22
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:00,188
"The successful apprehension
of Wilson Fisk."

23
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:01,481
I wear a mask.

24
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:05,277
Well, you can't mask that ass.
I'd know it anywhere.

25
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,570
You've been working out, by the way.
I appreciate that.

26
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:11,033
The Yakuza are a powerful organization
with powerful enemies.

27
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:12,868
- Mmm-hmm.
- What do they want with you?

28
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,787
I guess I have a way of
pissing people off sometimes.

29
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:18,040
- Yeah, I agree.
- Come on.

30
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,791
Don't be angry, Matthew.

31
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,876
I told you.

32
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,922
My money's planted deeply inside
investments with the Roxxon Corporation.

33
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,464
And Roxxon has ties to crime.

34
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:29,217
- How long have you known that?
- I didn't.

35
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,760
Until last night.

36
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:34,264
I stirred the pot a little
on the business side.

37
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:37,184
And when I did, who came knocking
on my door but the Yakuza.

38
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,853
Their mistake, because now,
they're after us.

39
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:44,983
No. Uh-uh. There is no us.
This is your problem.

40
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,904
Why can't you just divest your funds
from Roxxon and be done with it?

41
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,531
That's a coward's way out.

42
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,118
Someone screwed with me.
I don't like that.

43
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,537
- Then get a lawyer.
- I thought I did.

44
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,831
- Call the police.
- You're one to talk.

45
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:03,126
- Devil of Hell's Kitchen...
- Would you keep your voice down?

46
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:08,423
What I do is none of your business,
all right? Not anymore.

47
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:09,757
Matthew...

48
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,469
Let me tell you what's gonna happen now.

49
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:13,761
You're gonna finish your food,

50
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:16,056
you're gonna leave the waitress
the biggest tip she's ever seen,

51
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,308
then you're gonna get up and leave.

52
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,769
You're gonna book yourself on the first
available flight out of New York...

53
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:23,981
and get on it,
go back to whatever spa,

54
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:26,649
or resort,
or five-star hotel you just came from,

55
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,443
and stay out of my city.

56
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:33,115
If the Yakuza have their sights
set on something bigger

57
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:36,909
than your spoiled little rich ass,
then I will take care of them.

58
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,203
Let me tell you.

59
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:41,664
The Yakuza do have a bigger plan,
and I'm not going anywhere.

60
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:44,376
- You can't fight them.
- And you can?

61
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,419
I drove them out of New York once before.

62
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:49,506
Oh, no, you didn't.
The Yakuza never left.

63
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:53,260
They just hibernated and watched you
take out all of their enemies.

64
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,677
Now, New York is ripe for the taking,

65
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:57,014
and they plan on getting
to the top of the hill first.

66
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,640
Well, I'll scare 'em back
into hibernation...

67
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:00,433
I came to you.

68
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:03,061
If you don't want to be partners,
I'll handle it on my own...

69
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,562
- Partners?
- More coffee?

70
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:05,813
No.

71
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,317
I don't need a partner.

72
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:11,069
Yes, you do.

73
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:12,529
And so do I.

74
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:17,117
Because you have skills.
You fight better than anyone I know.

75
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,786
But I have information.

76
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:23,790
I gained access to Roxxon's servers right
in front of their little criminal faces.

77
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,586
We do it together,
we take them down fast and hard.

78
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,631
The second it's done,
I'm out of your city.

79
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:32,799
Forever.

80
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,635
The last time I saw you,

81
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:38,558
you put a knife in my hand and asked me
to slit Roscoe Sweeney's throat.

82
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:41,683
I happen to respect human life.

83
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:44,019
If we do this...

84
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:45,103
If...

85
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,066
then I need to know
you're at least gonna pretend

86
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,357
to feel the same way.

87
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,151
Nobody dies.

88
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,235
Do you understand?

89
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:54,696
Do you understand?

90
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,156
Oh, perfectly.

91
00:07:58,116 --> 00:07:59,117
Good.

92
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:01,078
I have a rule of my own.

93
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,162
Shoot.

94
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,497
No sex.

95
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:06,208
Oh, my God.

96
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,335
You have a pair on you.

97
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:09,419
Mmm?

98
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,629
This may come as a surprise to you,

99
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:14,257
but I've actually moved on
in the ten years since you left.

100
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,926
I'm seeing someone now,
which is only part of the reason

101
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,013
why I have zero interest in ever
starting anything up with you ever again.

102
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,099
Of course you do.

103
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:23,183
Check, please.

104
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,601
You're still so arrogant.

105
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:25,977
Just realistic.

106
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:28,188
What makes you think every man you meet
wants to sleep with you?

107
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:30,732
Because so far, they have.

108
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:35,737
We do this...

109
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,821
we work together,

110
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:39,074
we take down the Yakuza,
and then you're gone.

111
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,867
I don't wanna
ever see you again.

112
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,035
- Absolutely.
- Fine.

113
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,829
One last thing.

114
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,998
And this is the deal-breaker.

115
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:50,710
You have to give me back that pie.

116
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,134
<i>So, um, Miss Page,</i>

117
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:59,969
I drew this up based on
your official statement to the police,

118
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:01,388
about the Metro-General shooting.

119
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,015
You new to New York, Mr. Roth?

120
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,393
Born and raised.

121
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,728
- Is this your first case?
- Second.

122
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:09,979
I won my first.

123
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:11,856
Domestic violence.

124
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,401
I believe in protecting women.

125
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:15,735
Thanks. From all of us.

126
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:18,258
Uh, here, this says that Castle
pursued me down the stairwell,

127
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,240
but I went down, he went up.

128
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:22,784
Um, okay, that's a change I can make.

129
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:25,578
Also, I didn't escape on foot,
I had a car.

130
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:28,623
- I know I told the NYPD about that.
- Um... car.

131
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:31,584
I was also not Castle's only target.

132
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:34,379
That's just flat out wrong.
What about Grotto? Where...

133
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:35,547
Where did you get my statement?

134
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,299
- Grotto?
- Grote.

135
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:39,634
Oh, Elliot Grote.
Yeah, he's on the victim list.

136
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:44,347
Ballistics matched him to one of the many
guns connected to Frank Castle.

137
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,391
- Early start today?
- Matt.

138
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,685
Uh, this is Christopher Roth.

139
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,895
He's the public defender
assigned to the Castle case.

140
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:53,440
I just dropped by to get Miss Page's
signature on this statement.

141
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:55,358
Once we've got that,
we're all done.

142
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:56,568
Well, with this meeting.

143
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:58,528
With this case.

144
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:59,862
How so?

145
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:01,198
Castle's awake.

146
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,241
Soon, he'll plead guilty,
then it's open and shut.

147
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,909
Open and shut is good.

148
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:08,371
New York will sleep better knowing
Frank Castle's behind bars. I know I will.

149
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:10,915
Sleep even better when he's dead.

150
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:12,334
Uh, dead?

151
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,918
Well, lethal injection, probably,

152
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,463
although the electric chair
is a possibility.

153
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:18,923
New York doesn't have the death penalty.

154
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:20,758
Yeah, but Delaware does.

155
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:24,679
Some Dogs of Hell were murdered
out there along Interstate 95.

156
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:27,474
DA Reyes just has to link
the killings to Castle,

157
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:30,185
and then they'll be well within
their rights to extradite him.

158
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:31,561
And...

159
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,020
you know...

160
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,232
Are you and DA Reyes friends?

161
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:38,150
- I met her once.
- When?

162
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,737
Yesterday, when the judge
assigned me to the case.

163
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:43,865
But, look...

164
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,408
She's the one who took down the Punisher.

165
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:47,827
She's not going through all these paces

166
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,663
so that she can
not put the final nail in his coffin.

167
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:52,081
Literally.

168
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:54,751
I'm sorry, Mr. Roth,
I can't sign this yet.

169
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,168
Um...

170
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:58,796
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

171
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,674
We'll be in touch, Mr. Roth.

172
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,926
I'm sure we will.

173
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:14,937
Statement he wanted me to sign?
Complete work of fiction.

174
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:16,814
Probably handcrafted by Reyes.

175
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,538
Well, we could write an anonymous letter,

176
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,527
and maybe the judge
will assign a new public defender.

177
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,070
Yeah, or we could help Castle ourselves.

178
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:24,739
- No way.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:27,033
We don't have to defend him.
We could just negotiate a plea deal.

180
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:29,243
Without extradition,
or an electric chair.

181
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:32,955
And then, Castle goes away,
Reyes gets her ticker-tape parade...

182
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,541
everyone wins.

183
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,083
Everyone except us.

184
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,419
You see the front door?

185
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:40,171
The "open" sign is up,
but nobody's walking in.

186
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,506
If we keep messing with Reyes,

187
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,090
we'll be shuttered
by the end of the month.

188
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:44,216
Come on, if we stand up to her,

189
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,093
we could actually end
her incessant bullying.

190
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:47,679
And possibly save this guy's life.

191
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:49,389
A murderer who shot at you.

192
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,433
For reasons
that I don't fully understand yet.

193
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:52,725
Roth said Castle's
gonna plead guilty.

194
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:53,893
So we get in there,
we talk to him...

195
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:56,062
Ask him some questions about
what really happened to his family,

196
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,146
why Reyes wants him dead.

197
00:11:57,229 --> 00:12:00,567
Build a fair plea,
and show the DA our justice system...

198
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,984
still has a backbone.

199
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,821
This is a bad idea, Matt.

200
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:09,659
Um...

201
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:12,036
It's okay, I'll be outside.

202
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,670
I can't believe
we're even discussing this.

203
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,339
He chained you to a roof.

204
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,173
You, of all people,
should know he's a psychopath.

205
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,676
Okay,
his methodology is clearly wrong,

206
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,556
but... in his own kind of way,
he was trying to do something noble.

207
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,558
- Do you hear yourself?
- Yeah.

208
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,561
He wanted justice,
Foggy, like us.

209
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:40,064
So we should risk everything...

210
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:41,899
our firm, our reputation, and...

211
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:44,819
and let's be honest, our safety?

212
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:47,029
We should put it all on the line
to help him?

213
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,823
Kinda. Yeah.

214
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:53,411
Is this about saving a man
or saving a vigilante?

215
00:12:55,622 --> 00:12:56,914
He's a person.

216
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,209
Like you, Foggy. Like me.

217
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,589
And he shouldn't have to die.

218
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:15,975
Karen, grab your stuff.

219
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,186
We're going to the hospital.

220
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:27,445
You can't have cell phones
in this area, sir!

221
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,489
- What's going on?
- Reporters.

222
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:32,659
Looks like every outlet in town
wants a word with Castle.

223
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:35,119
Or a report on who does.
Come on.

224
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,289
You press?

225
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,374
Uh, no, attorneys.

226
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,919
IDs?

227
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,676
<i>This much spotlight
concern anyone else?</i>

228
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,095
I mean, we're about to step onto
a big proscenium stage here.

229
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:54,597
And how do I know what proscenium means?

230
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,433
Because I did theater in summer camp...

231
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:57,725
...which is exactly the kind of thing

232
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,369
that these reporters will find out
if they start digging into me.

233
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:01,479
Come on, jazz hands.

234
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,567
What the hell are you three doing here?

235
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,651
Brett...

236
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:09,696
You're wearing a tie, and...
it's not a clip-on.

237
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,531
This ain't a good time, Foggy.

238
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:14,414
- How'd you get babysitting duty, Sergeant?
- A detective sergeant now.

239
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,536
- A promotion?
- Uh, just lucky.

240
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,287
Top dogs like the press of a good collar.

241
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,831
Yeah, and the cops that get 'em.

242
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:21,207
Congratulations, Detective.

243
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,877
I'm sorry, but the area is restricted
beyond this point. You can't be here.

244
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,714
What if we have business
with Frank Castle?

245
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,381
Business?
Guy's barely conscious.

246
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,133
Our firm wants to represent him.

247
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,552
Man's already got a lawyer.

248
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:33,970
Yeah, we met that benchwarmer.

249
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,514
Not the freshest fish
the city could've drummed up, but...

250
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,349
he's in the running.

251
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:40,267
Brett, we feel Nelson and Murdock
is better equipped

252
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,311
to represent Mr. Castle's best interests.

253
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,564
Certainly over that
of his current legal counsel.

254
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:47,817
Look, I don't ask questions, but every
firm in the city's passed this one by.

255
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,570
Must be a reason.
You're chasing the wrong ambulance.

256
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,071
DA wants the death penalty.

257
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:54,115
The public defender is all but ready
to roll over and help.

258
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:57,409
They'll even extradite Castle
out of New York if that's what it takes.

259
00:14:57,494 --> 00:15:00,121
So we thought he'd respond
to our strategy of, you know,

260
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:01,247
keeping him alive.

261
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,584
Come over here.

262
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,715
Look,
none of this is my problem.

263
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:13,760
But all I know is,
you go up against this DA and lose?

264
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:16,679
The only funeral to attend
will be your firm's.

265
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:19,807
You're talkin' career suicide.

266
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:21,768
If we walk away...

267
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,060
we're letting him die.

268
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,149
Bags and briefcases get searched.

269
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,902
Do not give Castle anything.

270
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:33,863
Do not take anything from him.
Arms up.

271
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,240
They already searched us
when we came in downstairs.

272
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,535
Yeah?
And we're gonna do it again.

273
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:42,664
Everything's been removed
from inside the room.

274
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,792
He's tied down, but keep your distance
and mind the tape.

275
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:50,129
Do not step past it or I get to make
my dream come true and arrest you.

276
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:06,938
Oh, my God.

277
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:21,493
Matt, the tape.

278
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:25,122
Frank Castle.

279
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,793
My name is Matthew Murdock.

280
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:33,631
These are my associates,
Franklin Nelson and Karen Page.

281
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:34,882
Yeah.

282
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:37,509
I know who you are.

283
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:41,598
You protect shitbags.

284
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,396
We came here today to make you an offer.

285
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:53,192
We don't want money for our services,
we're not...

286
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:55,527
interested in fame or free advertising.

287
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,656
Weren't even assigned to your case.
We don't have to be here.

288
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,619
But you take a quick look around,
you'll notice we're the only ones who are.

289
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,120
As you may well know,

290
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:07,039
your list of enemies extends well beyond
the gangs you've killed.

291
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:10,668
You're very good
at making powerful enemies.

292
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:12,670
And the day you were admitted
to Metro-General

293
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:14,505
for the round you took to the head,

294
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,799
a do-not-resuscitate order
was placed on you.

295
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:20,803
And a shoot-to-kill order,
just a few days ago.

296
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:22,805
We know, because we heard it given.

297
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:24,849
These orders were issued
by the District Attorney.

298
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:27,852
And the fact that she's had it in for us
ever since we started asking questions

299
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,729
tells us we're on the right track.

300
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:32,481
Someone in the DA's office wants
you dead, Mr. Castle...

301
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:35,401
and we'd like to know why.

302
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,865
You let us take your case,
we can soften your sentence,

303
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:42,491
and give you a shot.

304
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:45,577
Maybe even find out who's responsible
for what happened to you.

305
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,833
We're talking about your life, Mr. Castle.

306
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:54,045
We can help you keep what's left of it.

307
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:55,296
Yeah.

308
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,800
Kinda like what you did for Grotto, huh?

309
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:02,136
Karen. Karen! Karen!

310
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:03,721
- Foggy!
- You want answers?

311
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:06,808
So do we, but none of us will
get them if you're dead.

312
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,894
Where did you get that?

313
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:11,979
From your home.

314
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,649
You were in my home?

315
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,109
Why were you in my house?

316
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:19,070
Who's in there? What?

317
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:21,613
- Open the door! Open...
- You go in my house...

318
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:24,826
Someone is lying about what happened
to your family, Mr. Castle.

319
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:28,620
You three, out! Now!

320
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:38,380
We're on shaky ground.

321
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,091
- You need to be really careful.
- Excuse me.

322
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,093
- How can we help you, Ms. Reyes?
- Get your things and go.

323
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,016
Uh, we have a little bit
of business here left.

324
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,722
Frank Castle already has counsel.

325
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:48,725
So, unless you've asked
the public defender for permission

326
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,517
to speak to his client,

327
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:53,645
you are in violation
of New York legal ethics.

328
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,982
We spoke to the PD this morning.

329
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:58,609
To be honest, he doesn't seem
all that prepared to tackle this case.

330
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,946
Although, he did mention the conversation
that you had with him yesterday.

331
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:07,284
Matt Murdock, is it?

332
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:09,746
- Yeah, pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm-hmm.

333
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,834
You have a reputation of being
a smart man, Mr. Murdock.

334
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,794
And since your colleagues seem unable

335
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:19,546
to grasp the hornets' nest
they keep kicking,

336
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,174
let me direct this at you.

337
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:24,844
Leave this ward, leave this man,

338
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:28,097
leave this entire case behind
before you wake up

339
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,809
six feet under the ash that was your
reputation and promising legal career.

340
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:34,812
We have a right to a private conversation
with a prospective client.

341
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,230
Not if there's a conflict of interest.

342
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:38,733
- And what conflict is that?
- Elliot Grote.

343
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:42,236
You can't represent Castle when
one of his victims was your former client.

344
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,446
- Alleged victims.
- All the same.

345
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,282
Representing Grotto might have
complicated matters,

346
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:49,243
but then again, all evidence of our work
with him and our deal with you

347
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,328
seems to have disappeared
from public record.

348
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:55,332
It's almost as if someone didn't want it
known that you violated a witpro contract,

349
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,584
jeopardized the safety of said witness,

350
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,045
and then ordered
a shoot-to-kill on Castle.

351
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:01,297
But I guess Ms. Reyes
could just confess to that

352
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,841
when she files
this conflict of interest complaint.

353
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:06,177
We have our case files
to back up our story.

354
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,344
How's your side looking?

355
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,470
The fact of the matter is,
Ms. Reyes,

356
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,514
the only person who shouldn't
be here right now is you.

357
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:13,935
Seeing as it's a breach of ethics for
the prosecuting attorney to communicate

358
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,020
with the defendant without his assigned
legal counsel present.

359
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,564
So, if you'll excuse us,

360
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:21,067
we'd like to resume
convincing Mr. Castle that,

361
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,986
unlike his current legal counsel,
we can actually help him.

362
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,280
- You already did.
- What?

363
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:28,950
Castle doesn't want the public defender.

364
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,618
Says Nelson and Murdock
are his lawyers now.

365
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:35,122
Thank you, Detective Sergeant.
If you'll excuse us.

366
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:36,791
Foggy, do you have my cane?

367
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,126
Thank you.

368
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,462
Finally feel like we have the upper hand
against that woman.

369
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:42,880
Yeah, she bluffs well,
but she'll negotiate.

370
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:45,091
- She doesn't want this going to trial.
- Of course.

371
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,802
She wants it to end quickly,
so she can move on to burying us...

372
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:50,554
- Just deal with one problem at a time.
- So where are we supposed to start?

373
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,598
Let's have the charges
and evidence summary brought in here.

374
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:55,351
We can weed through it and work out
what terms we want directly with Frank.

375
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,019
- It'll save time.
- Can't believe this is happening.

376
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,395
Oh, this is happening all right.

377
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,397
Yeah, come in.

378
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,152
Car service for a Mr. Murdock.

379
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,113
Car service?

380
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:11,200
Um... It's, uh, not a very good time.

381
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:12,784
My employer was quite insistent.

382
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,246
- His employer?
- Yeah, the new... the new client.

383
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:18,207
Um, could you just give us a minute?

384
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:21,585
Yeah, the...

385
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:25,256
That new client I mentioned,
um, I forgot I scheduled a meeting.

386
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:26,507
When?

387
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,969
- I guess it's now, I suppose...
- Seriously?

388
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:32,804
- After you insisted we come here?
- Foggy, you saw the bank deposit.

389
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,224
What kind of client
sends a driver anyways...

390
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:37,143
The kind that pays.

391
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,435
A lot.

392
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,813
I know the timing is awful, um...

393
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:45,234
It's okay, just go.

394
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,485
Go.

395
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,865
All right.
Um, call me with any issues.

396
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:53,034
This shouldn't take long, anyway.

397
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,493
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

398
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:55,912
Whoa.

399
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,704
Okay.

400
00:21:58,372 --> 00:22:00,374
Is this officially happening?

401
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:02,459
Are you guys dating?

402
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:04,420
- Uh, we're...
- Ooh. Uh, we...

403
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:05,963
Um...

404
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:08,215
Not... not labeling it.

405
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:13,137
You know, why don't I...
Why don't I walk you out?

406
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:23,522
You think he'll be okay?
With this?

407
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:29,153
Yeah, I mean,
it's a pretty small office.

408
00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:31,030
It's gonna take some getting used to.

409
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:32,364
Yeah, I guess.

410
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:37,869
But I'm not misremembering, am I?

411
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,164
It really was the best...

412
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:41,457
curry on the planet?

413
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,833
Mmm, yes.

414
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,585
Great, great curry.

415
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:47,379
Even better company.

416
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,134
I'll try to make this go quick.

417
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:54,220
You know what?

418
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,097
Foggy and I have got our hands full
with everything here.

419
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,515
Why not just make dinner
for tomorrow night?

420
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,642
- Yeah, can we?
- Yeah.

421
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:04,146
- And thanks for backing me up earlier.
- Well, I didn't do it for us.

422
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,398
I did it 'cause helping Frank,
getting to the truth,

423
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:08,734
that's the right thing to do.

424
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:11,153
What?

425
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:13,655
I know.

426
00:23:15,241 --> 00:23:16,783
- All right.
- Okay.

427
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,644
You can't just send a car for me
whenever you decide...

428
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:46,397
- Get undressed.
- What?

429
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:50,401
The invite says 7:00 p.m. sharp.

430
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:51,884
No, I... I can't do this right now.

431
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:53,654
- I got more important...
- We've been working so hard.

432
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:55,031
I thought we'd get boozy
and let loose for a night.

433
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:56,115
That's funny.

434
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:59,868
We're going to a gala to steal
a top secret Roxxon ledger

435
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:02,829
that details certain illegal goings-on
in Hell's Kitchen.

436
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,000
The way in is Stan Gibson.

437
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,003
Armed?

438
00:24:10,087 --> 00:24:12,881
Doubt it.
Works for Roxxon.

439
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:16,009
And according to my intel,
every employee carries a key card

440
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:19,971
that grants them access to their
secret floor in the Yakatomi building.

441
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:24,143
What sets our friend Stan apart
is that he's just an accountant.

442
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:26,062
Zero fighting chops.

443
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:29,940
So you're gonna pickpocket his key card?

444
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:32,401
- Yes.
- In the middle of a gala?

445
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:34,361
That's the idea.

446
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:40,159
After last night, the Yakuza know
they've been compromised,

447
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:43,662
which means security's
gonna be tight.

448
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:45,664
There was a time when you trusted me.

449
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:46,832
When was that?

450
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,210
We'll be fine.

451
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:51,503
I have a life.

452
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:55,969
Certain things I want to protect.
I need to know every step of this plan.

453
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,469
Matthew, where's the fun in that?

454
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,971
There isn't any. It's not about fun.
We have a deal.

455
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:02,514
I told you, one and done.

456
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:04,225
- After tonight...
- Farewell.

457
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:05,392
I know.

458
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,060
Yeah.

459
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:11,148
Let's make it count, then.

460
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:18,071
It's worse than I thought.

461
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,783
Thirty-seven separate murder charges.

462
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,034
What about you?

463
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,662
Uh, 98 lesser...

464
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:28,457
I mean,
felony assault, burglary...

465
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,502
criminal possession of a weapon,
reckless endangerment...

466
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,921
Any number
of criminal mischief charges.

467
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:36,423
We're so screwed.

468
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,927
You ready to go in?

469
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:42,053
No.

470
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,723
But considering the arraignment's
in a couple hours,

471
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,057
we don't have much of a choice.

472
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:56,735
Time to play twenty questions
with a killer.

473
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,988
<i>I've reviewed
the charges you're facing.</i>

474
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:03,200
It's my understanding that...

475
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:05,619
you wish to plead guilty to all of them?

476
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,208
I'm gonna need a...

477
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,919
verbal confirmation
if we're gonna continue.

478
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,471
Look, you asked us to represent you.
In order to do my job...

479
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:25,639
I'm guilty.

480
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:29,851
- Great, uh...
- I'm not talking to you.

481
00:26:32,229 --> 00:26:33,230
What?

482
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:36,567
Her.

483
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:41,405
I need to talk to her alone.

484
00:26:42,573 --> 00:26:43,990
Absolutely not.

485
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:48,329
- My colleague is...
- I'll... I'll do it.

486
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:04,345
- If you're feeling up to it, I...
- My family.

487
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:06,513
What do you know?

488
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:08,640
Uh, we can get to that.

489
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:10,892
What do you know...

490
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:14,145
about my family?

491
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:24,698
Have you ever seen this?

492
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:28,910
Police report,
complaint number 211974.

493
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,719
"Victims were stopped at a traffic light
northbound on Buellton Ave,

494
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:40,088
when an unidentified male suspect began
firing a 9mm handgun at their vehicle.

495
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,801
Juvenile male, juvenile female,
and adult woman

496
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:46,678
were found dead at the scene.

497
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:49,556
Adult male driver was critically wounded
and taken to Metro-General."

498
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:51,392
That's horseshit.

499
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:54,936
That's the story Reyes is running with.

500
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:59,900
But you and I know
you and your family, you...

501
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:03,028
you were at the carousel that day.

502
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,239
From what I can piece together,

503
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:09,034
it seems like you were caught
in some kind of firefight.

504
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:14,748
How much can you remember?

505
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:16,500
This ain't about what I remember.

506
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,043
Yes. Yes, it is.

507
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:23,757
Mr. Castle,
I've got a lot of puzzle pieces, but...

508
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,053
trust me, this moves a lot smoother
if you can tell me anything.

509
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,269
It goes in and out.

510
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:37,062
- Yeah.
- Okay.

511
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,774
The fact that it fades...

512
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:46,447
We took our blanket down to...
our spot.

513
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,491
She was by the carousel on the lawn...

514
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,744
Then I heard her shout.

515
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:55,205
Scream.

516
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,167
It was a grown man.

517
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:02,713
Who did you see?

518
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,923
I didn't.

519
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,510
But I found out later.

520
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:12,180
The Cartel.

521
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:13,307
Irish.

522
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:15,559
Bikers.

523
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:17,936
Anyone else?

524
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:21,607
I should've seen it coming.

525
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:24,568
- How could you know?
- What'd I just say to you?

526
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:25,861
I said that I heard it.

527
00:29:27,363 --> 00:29:28,489
I heard it...

528
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:32,033
and I didn't do anything.

529
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,580
My job was to keep them safe.

530
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:38,832
I didn't.

531
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,380
I didn't do it.

532
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:47,966
Uh, I think...

533
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,809
The questions can wait a minute,
I'll just...

534
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,011
Um...

535
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:52,178
Why don't I, uh...

536
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,474
Why don't I come back when you're...

537
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:56,683
You stay.

538
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:04,315
Please.

539
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:17,120
Wait, just hold on a second.

540
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,295
You like my stupid tie now?

541
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:28,590
- I love your stupid tie now.
- Yeah.

542
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:31,593
Come on,
let's go get what we came for.

543
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:54,032
- You must look nice.
- How would you know?

544
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:57,536
Turned a lot of heads.
Raising a lot of heart rates.

545
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:02,749
Too bad you can't enjoy the party.

546
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,835
I think I'll manage a good time.

547
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:06,462
Don't you love jazz?

548
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:10,591
Eh... I'm more accustomed to '90s Top 40.

549
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:13,343
Then you definitely
deserve a drink.

550
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:16,513
- Elektra.
- Relax.

551
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:19,641
It'll make people less self-conscious
around you.

552
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:23,979
Ms. Natchios, delighted to have you
here with us this evening.

553
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:27,816
You know I never pass up a chance
to have my ass kissed, Mr. Hirochi.

554
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:32,654
Then, unless this fine gentleman
has beaten me to the punch,

555
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:36,199
allow me to be the first kisser
this evening.

556
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,327
You look divine, my dear.

557
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:42,205
- Excuse me.
- Mmm-hmm.

558
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:45,208
First kisser, huh?

559
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,085
That's him, at the bar.

560
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:51,297
Finish your drink.

561
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:52,716
Why? We gonna dance?

562
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,803
Ah, just not my song,
but Stan's thirsty.

563
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:58,514
And now, so are we.

564
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:07,188
Macallan still your drink?

565
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:09,566
No, it's good. Consistent.

566
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,651
Neat.

567
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,486
Yes, I know.

568
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:19,618
Here we go.

569
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:21,953
Wait.

570
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:23,329
- Elektra.
- What?

571
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:26,207
<i>Eyes on Gibson at the bar.</i>

572
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,209
I guess Roxxon upped their security.

573
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:31,196
They're watching him pretty close.

574
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,090
They've pinpointed
their weak link.

575
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:36,301
They're smarter than they know.

576
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,263
And chances are,
they've got eyes everywhere else, too.

577
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:49,439
Well, this is going to be
more fun than I thought.

578
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:54,110
We have to get him alone somehow.

579
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:58,782
Leave it to me.

580
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,742
You just hang tight.

581
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:17,467
Oh, no!

582
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:19,219
- Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
- Ugh!

583
00:33:19,302 --> 00:33:21,221
Shit. Oh, God.

584
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:23,514
Did I get any on you?

585
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:25,684
Oh.

586
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:28,061
- It's nothing.
- Please, forgive me.

587
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:30,063
I insist you send me
the dry cleaning bill.

588
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:32,941
No, no, I should watch
where I'm going. It's my fault.

589
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:34,150
Here, allow me.

590
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:36,653
Ugh, I'm such an idiot.

591
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:37,779
Thank you, sir.

592
00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:39,322
Once again, I'm so sorry.

593
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:40,531
Think nothing of it.

594
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:42,993
- Enjoy the party.
- Thank you.

595
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:55,213
You were never in any danger.

596
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,383
What?

597
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:00,051
The other night.

598
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,681
Babysitting that shit brick,
running around with that Grotto.

599
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:06,516
I just...

600
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,645
I only hurt people that deserve it.
I wanted you to know that.

601
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:11,688
You think he deserved it?

602
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:12,898
I do.

603
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:19,780
You know he used to do hits for the Irish?

604
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:21,239
Huh?

605
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:24,159
One time, he shot an old lady
because she saw his face.

606
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:26,369
I guess he...

607
00:34:26,452 --> 00:34:29,080
He didn't tell you that, huh?

608
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:30,290
Yeah.

609
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:33,168
The point is,
you were safe, okay?

610
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:35,378
I just... wanted you to know that.

611
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:37,463
Guess I'm just supposed to
take your word on that.

612
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:38,548
Classy.

613
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:40,634
- Nothing to do with my word, lady.
- No?

614
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:41,760
No.

615
00:34:43,344 --> 00:34:45,180
Look, you got any idea what
a scout sniper is?

616
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,682
- You ever heard of that? No?
- No.

617
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:48,474
Okay, well, you're looking at one.

618
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,855
My class in Quantico was class 307.

619
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:55,065
And we had a... a motto.

620
00:34:55,148 --> 00:34:57,358
It was a saying, yeah?
It was, "One shot, one kill."

621
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,945
The point is, if I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

622
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:03,865
Why... why am I here?
Why did you ask me to stay?

623
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:09,370
I don't...

624
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,962
I guess I worry that... the memories
are just gonna go away.

625
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:22,425
- Mr. Castle...
- Look, you...

626
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:27,889
You went to...
You were in my house.

627
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:30,934
You...

628
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:32,060
You never went back?

629
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,314
- After your family was...
- No.

630
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:41,319
Can I just ask you, did you...
Were you in the kitchen?

631
00:35:42,403 --> 00:35:43,404
Yes.

632
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:46,700
The plates, were they...

633
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:50,620
Were they on the table,
or did they get into the sink?

634
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:51,872
Um...

635
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:54,875
Uh...

636
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,376
I think, washed.

637
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:57,794
In the rack.

638
00:35:59,212 --> 00:36:01,131
How about in the next room,
did you...

639
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:03,133
Did you see that piano that was there?

640
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:05,093
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

641
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:08,972
My son, Frank Junior, he...

642
00:36:09,055 --> 00:36:12,517
He used to grab a handful of cookies
and take 'em and hide 'em in that bench.

643
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,853
You know, he'd play soldier.

644
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:16,437
- Guard it, protect it.
- Oh, yeah?

645
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:17,856
Then he'd fall asleep down there.

646
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:19,399
We'd find him...

647
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:22,485
He'd be sleeping on a pile of...
pile of cookie crumbs.

648
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:24,029
Yeah, I, um...

649
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,866
When I was little girl,
I did the same thing.

650
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,578
Except ginger snaps and,
um, broom closet.

651
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:34,039
Oh, yeah?

652
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:35,916
Pretend it was a spaceship.

653
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:38,293
Take me... far away.

654
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,837
Did you? Yeah.

655
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:46,259
I guess we need that, right?
We need to get away sometimes.

656
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:51,973
I went up into the kids' bedrooms.

657
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:58,188
There were drawings on the walls and, uh,
sports trophies on the dressers.

658
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,608
Yeah, I was gone a lot, so I didn't...

659
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:04,402
I missed a lot of that.

660
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,862
There were toys...

661
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:08,364
scattered all over the ground, um...

662
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,034
A lot of plastic dinosaurs.

663
00:37:11,117 --> 00:37:14,120
Yeah, those were my little girl's.
Those were Lisa's.

664
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:17,623
When she was little,

665
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:20,293
she used to make these little noises
when she played with them.

666
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:25,882
What about the little...
the little car?

667
00:37:25,966 --> 00:37:27,050
Like a...

668
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,469
Like a remote-controlled Jeep.

669
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:32,597
Yeah, yeah, that, uh...
That was Frank Junior's.

670
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,640
I got that for him for his
seventh birthday.

671
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:35,976
He used to...

672
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,937
Yeah, he drove me crazy with that thing.

673
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,692
Look, Frank, it's...

674
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:47,112
It's really not for me to say...

675
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:50,907
but they clearly loved you.

676
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,368
Very much.

677
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:57,038
Yeah...

678
00:37:57,122 --> 00:37:58,623
Okay...

679
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:10,051
Here.

680
00:38:16,682 --> 00:38:17,851
Thank you.

681
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:25,150
Thank you, ma'am.

682
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:27,443
For what?

683
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:30,780
You helped...
You helped me remember.

684
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:33,909
You're welcome.

685
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:39,455
If you wanna ask your questions,
you can go ahead.

686
00:38:57,848 --> 00:38:59,475
Blind bastard.

687
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:03,688
Ugh, could one of you grab me a club soda?

688
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,440
Come on.

689
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:07,775
Oh, for Christ's sake.

690
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:10,904
What the hell? Did the power go out,
or did you hit the switch?

691
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:13,508
This will erase the recordings
and loop the security cameras.

692
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,060
- This way.
- One second.

693
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:27,438
Floor's crawling with security.

694
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:29,065
Come with me.

695
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:51,546
<i>It's your lucky day,
Mr. Castle.</i>

696
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:54,715
The six Dogs of Hell gang members
you wiped out in Delaware?

697
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:55,925
Won't be an issue anymore.

698
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:59,387
Delaware doesn't have the evidence
to charge and extradite, so...

699
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,515
the death penalty
is officially off the table.

700
00:41:02,598 --> 00:41:07,603
But Reyes also wanted three life sentences
without the possibility of parole.

701
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:11,191
But as the Nelson in Nelson and Murdock,
I got her down to one,

702
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:14,985
with the possibility of parole
in 25 years.

703
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,737
That's the good news.

704
00:41:17,363 --> 00:41:18,656
And the bad?

705
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:23,411
She wouldn't budge on protective custody.
He's gonna have to be in general pop.

706
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,580
Uh, no, that's bullshit.
All right? He'll be...

707
00:41:25,663 --> 00:41:28,374
He'll be surrounded by criminals,
people out for his blood.

708
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:29,834
Sounds like a party.

709
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:31,544
No doubt you can handle yourself,

710
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,467
but I think Reyes
is betting on the gangs here.

711
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,465
Legally, though?

712
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:38,343
I think this is the best possible deal
we're gonna make right now.

713
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:39,427
So...

714
00:41:40,261 --> 00:41:41,887
I recommend you take it.

715
00:41:43,306 --> 00:41:44,307
Okay.

716
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:48,811
Okay, so,
when the judge and Reyes come in...

717
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:51,856
all you have to do
is say three simple words.

718
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:53,941
"Guilty, Your Honor."

719
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:57,445
And you'll never have to see us again.

720
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:01,449
Can do.

721
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,206
Case number 4854,
<i>The People v. Frank Castle.</i>

722
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:09,889
Do you waive the reading of the charges?

723
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:11,000
Yes, Your Honor.

724
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:12,835
All right, then.

725
00:42:12,918 --> 00:42:15,088
How does the defendant plead?

726
00:42:28,643 --> 00:42:29,769
I plead not guilty.

727
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:32,480
You hear that, witch?

728
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:34,190
I'm gonna watch you burn
right along with me.

729
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:35,816
- You hear me?
- Counselor, please control your client.

730
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,985
- Do you hear me?
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

731
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:40,238
The defendant has entered
a plea of not guilty.

732
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:42,990
Due to the nature and severity
of the crimes he is accused of,

733
00:42:43,073 --> 00:42:44,492
bail is denied.

734
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:48,037
A court date will be set upon consultation
with the DA's office.

735
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:49,497
We are adjourned.

736
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:55,545
Holy shit.

737
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:57,963
That was not supposed to happen.

738
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:00,466
- What'd you say to him?
- What?

739
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,009
Three hours ago,
he was pleading guilty.

740
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:04,137
- Why did he change his mind?
- Maybe he just wants the truth.

741
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,971
About Grotto, about his family,
about the...

742
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:08,057
...the cover-up.

743
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:10,768
I mean, if we go to trial,
then it all comes out, right?

744
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:14,605
There's no "if."
This is happening.

745
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:16,316
Trial of the century.

746
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:19,068
We need to find Matt
before this goes wide.

747
00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:20,986
Tell him everything's about to change.

748
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,367
Elektra. Elektra.

749
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:15,750
Not bad, Magoo.

750
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:27,262
Eyes on Gibson?

751
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:29,054
<i>He's in the men's room, sir.</i>

752
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:42,151
It's there.

753
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:20,690
It's not there.

754
00:45:20,773 --> 00:45:22,483
It was supposed to be there.

755
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:36,288
I take it it's not here.

756
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:38,290
It was supposed to be there.

757
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:43,796
If they find Gibson, we're toast.

758
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:46,215
We have to go.

759
00:45:46,298 --> 00:45:48,217
- Matthew!
- Shh.

760
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:02,815
Stop the elevators.
We have an intruder on the 13th floor.

761
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:06,276
Pull up security footage.
I want to know who got to them.

762
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:14,827
Quick! Pull up
the cameras on the 13th floor.

763
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:19,248
What?

764
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,584
There's something behind this wall.

765
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:27,882
There's an electrical current
running through it.

766
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:30,050
Yeah?

767
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:32,928
Where?

768
00:46:34,263 --> 00:46:36,641
An interruption in the signal...

769
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,934
here.

770
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:40,561
Okay.

771
00:46:40,645 --> 00:46:41,646
Okay...

772
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,780
Ah.

773
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,660
I'm a genius.

774
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:05,545
Here, this one.

775
00:47:05,628 --> 00:47:06,796
Books, paper.

776
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:19,099
Hiro, get in here.

777
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:21,226
They're on a loop.

778
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:30,235
Sir, we found the problem.

779
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:33,698
All security, report to the 13th floor.

780
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:39,328
This is it.

781
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,956
The Roxxon ledger.

782
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:44,667
Not now, we gotta go.

783
00:47:54,176 --> 00:47:56,261
I don't speak Japanese,
but I think they know we're here.

784
00:47:56,345 --> 00:47:58,848
It's not working.

785
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:00,140
They're gonna see us.

786
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:02,226
Shut the power.
Close the gates.

787
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:08,816
- Shit, they found us.
- Let's go.

788
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:10,693
They've shut down the floor.
They're coming.

789
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:28,836
Now.

790
00:49:39,531 --> 00:49:41,491
- Don't move!
- Oh! Oh, my goodness!

791
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:42,993
We got something.
11th floor.

792
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:45,412
We are so sorry.

793
00:49:45,495 --> 00:49:47,331
This is, uh, very embarrassing.

794
00:49:47,414 --> 00:49:50,751
We just... thought we could,
uh, sneak in here.

795
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:53,087
But we'll be right out of here...

796
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:54,379
Sir...

797
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:56,924
He'll make a big donation.
He's very rich.

798
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:58,133
Oh...

799
00:49:58,217 --> 00:50:00,135
- Please, sweetheart, just...
- Ow.

800
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:03,097
- Very sorry, sir.
- Shut up!

801
00:50:17,737 --> 00:50:20,906
Nothing but a couple drunks.
Keep checking the 13th floor.

802
00:50:21,573 --> 00:50:22,700
Thank you.

803
00:50:22,783 --> 00:50:24,076
- You need to leave.
- Yes, certainly.

804
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,786
Once again,
we're so sorry, we didn't...

805
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,788
Now!

806
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:41,886
- Would you keep your shit together?
- Calm down.

807
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:50,144
<i>Invoices for arms.</i>

808
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:53,230
- Guns, ammunition...
- You read Japanese?

809
00:50:53,313 --> 00:50:54,690
Mmm-hmm.

810
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:58,110
Drugs. Designer stuff, mostly.

811
00:50:58,193 --> 00:50:59,611
And this looks like people.

812
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:02,114
Laborers of some sort.

813
00:51:03,198 --> 00:51:04,700
Sounds like a lot of them.

814
00:51:04,784 --> 00:51:06,744
Over the past several months.

815
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:08,245
And all from Japan.

816
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:15,335
- Oh, what is this?
- What is it?

817
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:18,297
I don't know.
This one, I can't read.

818
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,216
- What do you mean?
- It's in some kind of code.

819
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,509
This doesn't make sense.

820
00:51:22,592 --> 00:51:25,971
If invoices for drugs and guns
and human trafficking aren't encrypted,

821
00:51:26,055 --> 00:51:27,514
then what is?

822
00:51:29,474 --> 00:51:31,518
Wow, what are they hiding?

823
00:51:42,571 --> 00:51:44,699
Same time tomorrow, Matthew?

824
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,630
We have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars,

825
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:03,508
and decades of planning on this operation.

826
00:52:03,592 --> 00:52:05,427
And now...

827
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,889
our most valuable secrets
have been stolen.

828
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:10,766
I'd be very disappointed

829
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,394
to learn you aided this theft in any way,
Gibson-san.

830
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:15,813
I...

831
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:18,190
I had nothing to do with it.

832
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:20,735
We entrusted you with access.

833
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:27,324
Even employed security to protect you
and ensure the sanctity of our operation.

834
00:52:27,407 --> 00:52:29,076
I was in the bathroom.

835
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:30,995
We were attacked.

836
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,293
Listen!
Listen, I would never betray you!

837
00:52:38,377 --> 00:52:40,796
I have nothing but respect for the Yakuza!

838
00:52:42,047 --> 00:52:44,424
Who said I was Yakuza?

839
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,149
Foggy?

840
00:53:00,232 --> 00:53:01,942
You weren't answering your phone.

841
00:53:08,908 --> 00:53:10,951
- Why are you fancy?
- What's going on?

842
00:53:12,787 --> 00:53:14,371
The arraignment.

843
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:19,877
Frank pled not guilty, Matt.

844
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,837
- What?
- And it gets worse.

845
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:25,800
Reyes pulled every string she has
and fast-tracked the trial.

846
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:27,467
What...

847
00:53:29,804 --> 00:53:30,846
All right.

848
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,932
All right, all right, so we, uh...
we motion to extend.

849
00:53:33,015 --> 00:53:34,183
We, um...

850
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:37,352
maybe streamline our case theory,
and not waste time fighting any charges...

851
00:53:37,436 --> 00:53:39,479
You don't understand, Matt!

852
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:41,606
Frank agreed!

853
00:53:42,524 --> 00:53:45,027
He thinks he's stickin' it to Reyes
or something.

854
00:53:46,946 --> 00:53:49,781
I hope your schedule is clear, buddy.

855
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:52,117
'Cause <i>The People v. Frank Castle...</i>

856
00:53:53,202 --> 00:53:54,870
starts next week.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
