00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:02,802
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,108 --> 00:00:04,741
For 5 years, I was stranded

3
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:08,378
on an island
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,796
survive.

5
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:11,615
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:11,617 --> 00:00:14,384
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

7
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:16,119
Make it home.
Right my wrongs.

8
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:17,137
No!

9
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:18,955
To use the list of names
he left me

10
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:23,126
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

11
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:26,963
To do this, I must
become someone else.

12
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:28,765
I must become...

13
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:30,984
something else.

14

As Kanye says,

You better move! Move!

17
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,696
Nobody lift their head,
nobody gets hurt.

18
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:43,664
Get down!

19
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,981
Get on the floor
right now!

00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,034
You can't jackhammer
into the safe.

22
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:48,485
It's too thick.

23
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:51,705
Shut up!

24
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,374
We're through!

25
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,043
3 minutes.

26
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:57,294
Make it 2!

27
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,721
[Whispering] Are you
trying to get us killed?

28
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:09,473
Don't worry.

29
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:11,441
I'm a cop.

30
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,312
Please don't do
anything.

31
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:16,897
I don't want to die.

32
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,448
Please!

[Screaming]

What the hell's going on?

35
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:32,529
He was a freakin' cop.

36
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:35,299
Enough throwing shots.

37
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:37,751
[Siren]

38
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:38,752
you hear that?

39
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:42,639
Someone triggered the alarm!

40
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:43,707
Don't!

41
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,342
That's it. Let's go.

Starling City
police department.

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,514
Lay down your weapons
and come out with your hands up.

44
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:52,015
Everybody keep down!

45
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:54,518
Nobody lifts their head,
nobody gets hurt.

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,686
You stay down!

47
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:03,610
Hold your fire.

48
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:08,231
These are hostages.

49
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,866
You take the hostages.

50
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,586
All units, move in!
Move in!

51
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,750
Come here. You shot a cop.

52
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:28,935
This is not how
we do things.

53
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,254
Me getting killed isn't how
we do things, either, is it?

54
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,773
Is it?
Get in the van!

Anchor the rear hand,

Most fighters work
at the same pace.

You switch it up, you throw
your opponent off his game.

61

[Groans] That was nice.

64
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,792
One of them.

65

Any others?

66
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:12,729
You know, one day you're
gonna be straight with me

67
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,314
about what really
happened on that island.

68
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:16,800
Absolutely.

69
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:18,935
Uhh!

70
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,604
But not today.

71
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:23,824
Still some pretty
sweet moves.

72
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:26,326
Yep. Tonight I'm gonna
use them on him.

in the dead of winter.

76
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,837
Which is at least
a month away.

77
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:37,954
Look at this.

78
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,924
These guys started
at Keystone 3 years ago,

79
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:43,493
then began moving west,
hitting banks along the way.

80
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,329
This morning they hit
Starling City Trust.

81
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,015
Shot an off-duty cop.
He's in a coma

82
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:51,718
and the doctors are saying
it's a coin toss whether he'll make it.

83
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,687
If he's a cop, SCPD
will be all over it.

84
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:56,339
Overwhelmed? Underfunded?

85
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,442
Listen, these guys
don't hit one time.

86
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,143
They hit 2 or 3 banks
per city,

87
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,845
which means right now
they're planning their next job.

88
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,196
I think you have
the wrong impression

89
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:04,364
about what it is
I do.

90
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,199
You take out bad guys
with a bow and arrow.

91
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:08,118
I don't fight street crime.

92
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
That's a symptom
of what's wrong with this city.

93
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:11,688
I'm trying to cure
the disease.

94
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,408
CEOs and crooked
entrepreneurs. I get it.

95
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,410
Listen, Oliver,
I'm just saying,

96
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:18,879
maybe you can
make a difference

97
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,164
if you think beyond
the scope of those pages.

98
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,883
I'm sure your father
wouldn't mind.

99
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,217
No, you don't get it.

100
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,052
My father died
so that I could live.

101
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,921
Live and make a difference
by fixing the city

102
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:30,173
that he and the people
in this book ruined.

103
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,259
Every name
that I cross off this list

104
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,543
honors that sacrifice.

105
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:35,712
There's more than one way
to save this city.

106
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:37,931
Not for me.

107
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,167
Crime happens
in this city every day.

108
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,520
What do you want me
to do, stop all of it?

109
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:47,891
It sounds like you have
a narrow definition of being a hero.

110
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:54,114
I'm not a hero.

111
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:15,089

Please tell me
that this is a nightmare

115
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,435
and I'm about to wake up.

116
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:33,272
How can Stagg Industries
pull out completely?

117
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:34,539
They're our largest donor.

118
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,790
It's like they say--
"It's the economy, stupid."

119
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:39,075
No, it's the stupid
economy.

120
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:41,912
Ok, without Stagg, how long
can CNRI keep the doors open?

121
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:44,164
It depends.
What time you got?

122
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,665
I have fiesta time.

123
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,300
Or is it siesta time?

124
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:49,553
Which one means a party
and which one means a nap?

125
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:52,305
Tommy, as much
as I would love to relive

126
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:55,175
intro to Spanish with you,
today is not a good day.

127
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:57,677
Of course not. Working in this tiny
brick office is intolerable.

128
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,886
Now, you know where is
a spectacular place

129
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:00,982
to spend the day?

130
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,850
Coast City. Here's what
I am thinking.

131
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,769
Sunset flight
on my private plane,

132
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:08,405
dinner at Broome's,
I'll have you home by midnight.

133
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:11,241
Or maybe in the morning.

134
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:13,142
What is this?

135
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:15,144
This is what
we talked about.

136
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:17,313
This is you getting to know
the real me.

137
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:18,698
Tommy, so you don't
misunderstand,

138
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,150
CNRI just lost
its largest single donor.

139
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:23,670
Which means all of the hard work
and sacrifices

140
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:25,589
that I have made to help
this legal clinic survive,

141
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:27,874
it may have been for nothing.

142
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:32,379
Maybe another time.

143
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,180
Yeah?

144
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:41,605
I mean, haven't you noticed
she's been acting a little down lately?

145
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:44,057
What am I saying?
Of course you haven't.

146
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,559
Well, who are you
to judge?

147
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,677
Since when do you
pay attention to how mom's feeling?

148
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:50,113
Since our stepfather suddenly
decided to take a business trip

149
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:51,648
halfway across the world.

150
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,984
I think when someone at Walter's
pay grade takes a business trip,

151
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:55,702
it's always sudden, Thea.
I wouldn't worry.

152
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:58,371
Ah, guess who I just
hung up with.

153

Is he perfect?

159
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,249
According to you.

Carter Bowen just won

Carter Bowen is anchoring

make that big of a fuss.

163
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,557
Oliver, Carter
just got accepted

164
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,726
into Harvard and Princeton.

165
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:22,045
Well, that's because Carter
got a perfect score on his SATs.

166
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:25,098
Now, how did he manage
to study and cure cancer?

167
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,067
All right, all right,
all right. I get it. I get it.

168
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,936
Well, they're coming for brunch
and I expect you to be there.

169
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,321
I have plans.

170
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:33,023
That's fine.
Brunch is tomorrow.

171
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,558
Hmm. Inches from
a clean getaway.

172
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,893
Well, you, too, Thea.

173
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:37,894
Snap.

174
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,362
Nobody says that anymore.

175
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:41,281
What? Mom.

176
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,332
Hmm?

177
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:43,750
I can't actually go.

178
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:46,753
I haven't seen
the Bowens in years.

179
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:48,788
So whatever it is
that you have planned,

180
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm sure the two of you can make
the sacrifice just this once.

181
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:55,178
We'll be there.

182
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,104
I hate you.

183
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:08,892
[Cell phone vibrating]

184
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:10,360
Yeah.

185
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:12,278
You know your friend
Scott Morgan from your father's list?

186
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,730
He tried to kill himself.

187
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:16,265
Maybe he was afraid
of getting a visit from you.

188
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:17,784
How fast can you make it
to Starling General?

189
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:19,869
On my way.

190
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:22,572
Hey, just the man
I wanted to see.

191
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:23,907
I just picked up
a new sports car,

192
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,408
and I'm thinking
we can open her up,

193
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,293
pick up a few
speeding tickets--

194
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:30,413
that sounds great, but something's
come up. I gotta jet.

195
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,998
Oh. Uh, okay.

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,450
Nice talk. Thanks.

197
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:38,505
He moves fast, doesn't he?

198
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:39,622
It's ironic, really,

199
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,391
since you're the one
we call speedy.

200
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:45,478
Oh, please.
For the love of God.

201
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,399
But if you need somebody to talk to,
I'm here.

202
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:53,303
You know,
maybe you could help.

203
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:56,773
There's this girl
that I'm interested in.

204
00:08:56,775 --> 00:09:01,244
And I am really not sure
how to pursue it.

205
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:03,863
Have you tried using
your usual lines?

206
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:06,700
Hi, my name is Tommy Merlyn
and I'm a billionaire,

207
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:08,301
but I don't look like
Warren Buffet.

208
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:10,370
Yeah. She is aware
of that,

209
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:11,871
and she doesn't care.

210
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:13,623
You know, money really
isn't a big deal to her.

211
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,926
Why don't you just
tell her how you feel?

212
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,545
Well, I've--I--

213
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:20,930
I've known her
for a long time,

214
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:23,833
and I'm not sure the direct approach
is really the right way to go.

215
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,552
Maybe you just
have to figure out

216
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:30,390
what's a big deal to her
and make it a big deal to you.

217
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:32,609
Yeah.

218
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,111
You are amazing.

219
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:37,197
Love you.

220
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,957
You sure?

221
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,043
Scott Morgan doesn't
seem like the type

222
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:51,711
who would try
to kill himself.

223
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:56,049
True, but it's the best lie
I could come up with on short notice.

224
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:59,803
Mr. Diggle,
I can't thank you enough

225
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:01,024
for arranging to move my husband

226
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:03,187
from County Ward
to Starling General.

227
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,789
Now I know he's getting
the best care available.

228
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:07,227
You really should be
thanking this man,

229
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:08,928
Oliver Queen.
He's paying the bill.

230
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,314
Jana's husband Stan
is a police officer,

231
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,113
who happened to have
been making a deposit

232
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:14,735
at Starling Trust Bank.

233
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,486
The bank that was robbed.

234
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:19,091
I was so sorry
to hear about your husband.

235
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:20,658
Is he gonna be okay?

236
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,659
The doctors say
the next 24 hours are crucial.

237
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:25,561
He should have just
kept his head down, you know?

238
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:27,530
I've known a few police
officers in my day.

239
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:28,898
Always willing
to help others

240
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,284
even if that means
putting themselves at risk.

241
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,071
Thank you.

242
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,574
You're welcome.

243
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,248
You lied to me.

244
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,600
You asked me to work
with you, not for you.

245
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:49,502
And when you did,
you said it was because

246
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:51,304
you understand
the kind of man I am.

247
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:53,139
Well, Oliver, I'm the kind of man
who doesn't walk away

248
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:54,924
when there's a chance
to make a difference.

249
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:56,759
And neither does
Stan Washington.

250
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,428
Oliver, I'm not finished talking.
Where are you going?

251
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,814
To go make a difference.

252
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:03,149
Let's catch
some bank robbers.

253
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,453
See that guy right there?
He's got a temper.

254
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,038
And he shot
Officer Washington.

255
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,205
That's right.

256
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,175
College ring.

257
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,894
Or high school,
more likely.

258
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,312
That ring will get us
an I.D.

259
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,931
Yeah, but even with
photo enhancement,

260
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,433
you're gonna have a problem
getting a clear shot of that ring.

261
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,686
No, but it left an impression the police
would have photographed.

262
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,604
It'll be in evidence
lockup.

263
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:36,926
Please tell me you're not going
where I think you're going.

264
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,629
Diggle,
why do you even ask?

265
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:52,158
Are you kidding me?
I don't want to hear this.

266
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,177
Don't tell me about
red tape.

267
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,962
One of our own's been shot.

268
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:59,132
Tell them to find themselves
a pair of scissors.

269
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:25,541
So, where are you
gonna take me today?

270
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:27,577
Monte Carlo?

271
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,363
Actually, I was just
telling Jo here

272
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,332
that the Merlyn Global Group

273
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,000
is looking to expand
its local philanthropy,

274
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:36,202
and I thought
that we could start

275
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:38,805
by sponsoring a benefit
for CNRI.

276
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:41,140
Thank you, Tommy,
but I think we can manage

277
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,076
without your family's
finances.

278
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:46,562
Laurel, a word?

279
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:49,182
Come on.

280
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:51,050
What are you doing?

281
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,937
He's not interested
in throwing us a fundraiser.

282
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,439
What he wants to have
is the first annual attempt

283
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,107
to get back
into my pants gala.

284
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,076
Who cares why he's doing it?
We need the money.

285
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:04,280
Not like that we don't.

286
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,700
We really do. So you're gonna
listen to your best friend's advice.

287
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:12,338
You are gonna go over there
and say, "Thank you, Tommy,

288
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,458
we'd be honored if you'd
throw us a fundraiser. Hmm?

289
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,216
Thank you, Tommy.
We would be honored

290
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:25,718
for you to throw us
a fundraiser.

291
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,924
The bank manager
Ace punched,

292
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,977
his ring left a mark.

293
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,731
Larchmont High.

294
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,283
High school.

295
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,101
I cross-referenced
his height and relative age

296
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:43,786
with a list of students
and alumni.

297
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,455
Still, that's
a pretty long list.

298
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,825
It was. I dug a little deeper
and found Kyle Reston.

299
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,293
Right before Kyle's
senior year,

300
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,611
not only did he drop out,
he dropped off the grid.

301
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,414
Along with his family--

302
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,918
father, mother,
younger brother.

303
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,120
There are two other guys
involved in this robbery.

304
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:02,305
And a woman.

305
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,023
Aside from Stan Washington,

306
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,641
there were 22 customers
and employees

307
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:06,809
that came out of the bank.

308
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,144
9 men, 13 women.

309
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,628
Inside the bank,

310
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,814
9 men, 14 women.

311
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:14,017
They put a ringer in.

312
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,519
The mom. The police
are looking for a crew,

313
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,604
we're gonna look for a family.
Speaking of which,

314
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:20,139
I'm incredibly late
for mine.

315
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:23,242
Well, I'm sorry Walter
couldn't join us.

316
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:26,645
Oh, yes, well, the Australian trip
came up suddenly.

317
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,147
He sends his apologies.

318
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,666
Where's Oliver?
He's not out of town, too, is he?

319
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:31,868
Oh, I'm sure he's just--

320
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,152
Stuck in traffic.

321
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:35,455
One of the things
I didn't miss on the island--

322
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,841
Sunday drivers.
Sorry I'm late.

323
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:40,960
Thank God you're here.

324
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,128
It is so good
to see you.

325
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,931
Mm. We all thought
you were--

326
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:47,166
oh, well, we are
just happy he's home.

327
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,335
Hmm. And returning
a celebrity, too.

328
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:50,669
How do you mean?

329
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:54,023
Billionaire scion,
castaway for 5 years.

330
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,725
You know,
there is a bidding war

331
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,611
for the rights
to your life story.

332
00:14:58,613 --> 00:14:59,812
At least that's what
my agent says.

333
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:02,315
Agent? I thought you were
a neurosurgeon, Carter.

334
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,067
I know.
It's crazy, right?

335
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,368
One minute I'm
publishing this book

336
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,537
on how long-term
potentiation

337
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,873
initiates the creation
of a slow-moving

338
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,958
protein synthesis,

339
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,376
and the next,
there's an agent

340
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,744
trying to make me
the next Dr. Oz.

341
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,046
Why would he want
you to be a wizard?

342
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:18,047
[Laughing]

343
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,048
Oh, Oliver.

344
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,084
For all our sakes,
start ready "Us Weekly."

345
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,087
Well, the truth is,
I just feel it's our duty

346
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,140
as Starling City's more fortunate
to help those most in need.

347
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,307
Oh, of course.

348
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,375
Wouldn't you agree,
Oliver?

349
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:32,228
You're the hero, Carter.

350
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:38,717
Quick and clean,
and try not to shoot anybody.

351
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,657
So now that you're back,
what are your plans?

352
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,326
Will you be taking a job
with Queen Consolidated?

353
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,727
I'm opening a night club.

354
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:50,446
[Laughs]

355
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:51,781
Sir, your liquor
distributor's on the line.

356
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:55,535
First Bank of Starling
was hit two minutes ago.

357
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:59,539
Sorry. Business.

358
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:04,343
If the Restons' M.O. holds,
they'll make their escape underground.

359
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:07,296
First Bank of Starling is located
right above the water treatment tunnels.

360
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,914
The entrance is located here.

361
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,933
Oliver.

362
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,301
Where are you going?

363
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,603
Something's come up.

364
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,088
I'm really sorry.

365
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,278
[Siren]

366
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,713
SCPD! Don't move!

367
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,451
Enough! What are you doing?!

368
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,805
Let's get out of here!

369
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:12,478
Forget it!
The cash!

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,330
Let's go!

371
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:16,949
All right, let's move!

372
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:21,003
It's vigilante.

373
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,379
Who the hell was that guy?

374
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,563
The local vigilante.

375
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,948
Usually goes after
rich guys.

376
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,316
Well, clearly
he's branching out.

377
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:48,517
Things have gone sideways
for us lately.

378
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,203
That hood guy showing up,
Kyle shooting a cop.

379
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,404
You were the one
who warned me he was a cop.

380
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,789
So you would take his gun,
not shoot him.

381
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,124
Your mother has a point.

382
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,409
Maybe this is a sign
we need to hang it up.

383
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,460
Head for Mexico, retire.

384
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,162
We don't have enough.

385
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,780
We always said
that we wouldn't quit

386
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,916
until we had enough
to set ourselves up.

387
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,617
The kid's right.
We need to hit another.

388
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,469
We'll be okay. We can make do
with what we've got.

389
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:10,973
I didn't spend 5 years
risking my life and my freedom

390
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:12,341
to just be okay.

391
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,243
No. Set for life.

392
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,713
That was our deal.

393
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,466
Ok.

394
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,302
One more.

395
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,588
And then we're out.

396
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,562
I should add "personal Internet
researcher for Oliver Queen"

397
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:36,231
to my job title.

398
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:39,451
Happily, I mean.

399
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,670
His name is Derek Reston.

400
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:44,072
We were close before
I... went away.

401
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:46,391
And I want to
get back in touch.

402
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:48,110
I guess you didn't have
Facebook on that island.

403
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:50,218
Nope. Not even
a MySpace account.

404
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:52,243
It was a very dark time.

405
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,783
Well, there's not much here
that's recent.

406
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,785
No credit activity.

407
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,087
No utility bills.

408
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,423
Well, I guess you guys
must have met at the factory.

409
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:05,093
Wait.
What--what factory?

410
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,013
The Queen Steel Factory.

411
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:10,098
Derek Reston worked there
for 15 years

412
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,250
until it shut down in '07.

413
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,888
Derek Reston
worked for my father?

414
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,540
You weren't really
close friends, huh?

415
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,428
It looks like Derek
was the factory Foreman

416
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,031
until your dad outsourced
production to China.

417
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:28,950
About 1,500 employees
got laid off.

418
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,696
Looks like the finance guys
even found a loophole

419
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:33,432
in the union contract,
so, they didn't have to pay

420
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:35,731
severance packages
and pensions to their employees.

421
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,411
They all pretty much
lost their homes.

422
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:41,346
Including your friend.

423
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,285
You died.

424
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:52,123
I asked you,
I begged you to survive.

425
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,459
But I don't think you can.

426
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,147
There's still one bullet left.

427
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,103
But, Oliver,

428
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:09,608
my death is made
meaningless by yours.

429
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,083
I'm starving.

430
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:19,334
I'm gonna die anyway,

431
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,503
and I just want it
to be quick.

432
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,822
I want it to be quick,
like yours was.

433
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,675
You can survive this.

434
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:29,994
No, I can't.

435
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:34,850
I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

436
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:37,302
And I'm sorry.

437
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,770
[Gunshot]

438
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,939
The Restons just got home
after 5 years of being away.

439
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,308
Those factory guys hung out
at a bar after work.

440
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,943
I'm going down there.
Hopefully Derek Reston

441
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,811
wants to take a stroll
down memory lane.

442
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,030
And if by some miracle
Reston's there?

443
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,982
I'm gonna give him
the chance to do the right thing.

444
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,485
Oliver, he already had his chance
to do the right thing.

445
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,287
It's called
not being a criminal.

446
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:58,206
This is happening
because of my father.

447
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,125
Because of my family.

448
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,877
No. You're worried
about the wrong thing.

449
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:05,163
It's not your fault.
The Restons aren't the victims.

450
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,198
My family
stole from this city.

451
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,917
They hurt the people in it.

452
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,736
And I am hell-bent
on making that right.

453
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:15,390
For Derek Reston, that
means giving him the chance

454
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:17,425
to make it right.

455
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:22,314
Hey, don't fade on me now.

456
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:25,233
We have about 10,000
more decisions to make.

457
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:28,570
Now, cake--
chocolate or mocha?

458
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:31,055
Mm...Carrot.

459
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,608
Are you sure about that?
Because Bugs Bunny hasn't RSVP'd yet.

460
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:40,064
Tell me,
why the full-court press?

461
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,867
Asking me to coast city,
the fundraiser--

462
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,786
why now?

463
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,510
You know, I was in a bar
last week,

464
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,079
and I was talking
to this girl,

465
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,182
and things were progressing,
if you know what I mean.

466
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,768
No. You're too subtle.

467
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,105
Anyway, we finally
go back to her place,

468
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:06,424
and I realize all of a sudden--

469
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,626
[clears throat]

470
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,210
That I'd been there before.

471
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:12,447
Been with her before.

472
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:14,132
Two years ago.

473
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:16,735
Just... didn't remember.

474
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:19,504
So I left.

475
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:28,079
You know, I remember
some of the mornings

476
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,732
when you and I
were together

477
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:34,252
and I made you omelets.

478
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:39,007
And I'd be in your kitchen
and I would think to myself,

479
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,142
