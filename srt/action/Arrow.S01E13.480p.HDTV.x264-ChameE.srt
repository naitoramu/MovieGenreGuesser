1
00:00:00,484 --> 00:00:03,717
My name is Oliver Queen.
For five years,

2
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:07,519
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:09,354
survive.

4
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:11,240
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:13,692
Now I will
fulfill my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:15,944
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:19,147
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:21,083
To do this,

9
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,151
I must become someone else.

10
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,555
I must become
something else.

11
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,458
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,327
Next time your daughter
calls the Vigilante,

13
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:31,795
we'll be able
to listen to every word.

14
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:33,413
I know you swore to bring
this guy down, detective,

15
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:36,249
but using your own
daughter as bait,

16
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,585
that's stone cold.

17
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:43,290
Where'd you get it?
From your stepfather.

18
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,225
And where
did he get it?

19
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:47,077
Belongs to your mother.

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,668
Mmm.

21
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:17,757
Hi, George.

22
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,843
Vanch...
Surprised to see me?

23
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:23,296
I imagine you would be, seeing
as how you botched my trial,

24
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,800
and from what Viv here tells me,
protecting my interests.

25
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:30,303
There were contingencies
that couldn't be anticipated.

26
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:32,272
Yes, Vivian told me.

27
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:34,274
The head of the Triad
getting ventilated,

28
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:36,359
Bertinelli getting collared,

29
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,611
and, uh, this archer.

30
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:40,363
Exactly.

31
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:42,449
What am I supposed to do in
the face of something like that?

32
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:45,785
Absolutely nothing, Georgie.
Tell you what.

33
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:48,688
All is forgiven.
Give us a hug.

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,991
Come on.

35
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:57,747
You know, I could use
a place to stay

36
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:00,834
while I'm getting my sea legs
back under me, George.

37
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:04,304
And you got a nice place here.

38
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:07,507
What do you say? George?

39
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,877
George?

40
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,013
Ahem.

41
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:15,882
I hope George
has been food shopping.

42
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:18,685
I'm famished.

43
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,579
So this book contains
a list of the names

44
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,364
of the guys you've been hunting.

45
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,583
And this book,
your mother's,

46
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:36,069
has the same list of names.

47
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:37,954
It's identical.

48
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,173
So where'd your mother
get her copy, Oliver?

49
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:43,076
For that matter,
who gave it to you?

50
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:44,878
Felicity Smoak.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,514
She said that Walter found it
in their bedroom.

52
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:49,466
And now he's missing.

53
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,352
She's my mother,
Diggle.

54
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:54,220
She's not the kind
of person who would--

55
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:56,022
Have her husband disappeared?

56
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:58,108
Because that's really
the question, isn't it, Oliver?

57
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,860
I understand why you would believe
your mother over your stepfather,

58
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:03,730
but I tend to believe the innocent
party is whoever's missing--

59
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:06,900
and presumed dead.

60
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,317
Twitch, and I will
open your throat.

61
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,602
How many more with you?

62
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,020
What?!

63
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,773
You have ten seconds
to tell me something I believe

64
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,642
before I cut out
your voice box.

65
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,528
Wait, wait, wait.
Yao Fei sent me here,

66
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,947
and I'm pretty sure
it wasn't so you could kill me.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,618
What?

68
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,621
Yao Fei.

69
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:04,841
He gave me
directions to your...

70
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,660
plane.

71
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,667
Frank, you got be
kidding me.

72
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,469
You can't throw me
another assignment now.

73
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,221
It's Lieutenant,
and I'm pretty sure

74
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:19,806
that's what gives me
the authority.

75
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,608
I'm drawing in
on the Hood investigation.

76
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,359
I am going
to get this bastard.

77
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:25,678
Have you considered
the possibility no one wants you to?

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,113
What?

79
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,731
He saved the Christmas hostages.

80
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,034
He took down an arsonist
and armored car thieves,

81
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:34,621
and just last week, he busted
the Vertigo drug ring when we couldn't.

82
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,956
What was urban legend's
becoming heroic.

83
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,025
If this man's a hero,

84
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:41,878
I don't know what my life
in this city as a cop means.

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,713
Let me suggest you find meaning
in following orders.

86
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,131
Frank, listen!

87
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,583
I'm close.

88
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:48,334
If my lead comes
to something more...

89
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,803
Come to me with something real,
Quentin, and we'll talk.

90
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:54,841
In the meantime,
I'm assigning you another case.

91
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:03,149
Hey.

92
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:04,651
Heading out?

93
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:06,486
Oh, yeah,
it's a meeting

94
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:09,222
with the financial
planners.

95
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:11,241
Are you all right?

96
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:14,861
There was something
that I wanted to talk to you about.

97
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,665
I want to talk
to you about Walter.

98
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:23,736
Right around Christmas,
when he...disappeared,

99
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:27,340
he gave me this.

100
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,177
This is your
father's notebook.

101
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:34,647
He kept a list

102
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:37,750
of all the people in Starling City
who owed him favors.

103
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:40,086
I had...no idea

104
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,437
there was
so many of them.

105
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,223
I've just been researching

106
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:45,725
some of those names
online, and, um,

107
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:47,393
they're not good people.

108
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:51,397
Oliver, I have no idea
what your father

109
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,700
was involved in
or with whom.

110
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,235
And you and your sister
both now know

111
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:58,154
that he wasn't exactly
honest with me.

112
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:00,406
Then we need to find out--
no.

113
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:02,775
If what you say
is true

114
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,894
and this list is filled
with bad people

115
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,213
and Walter was looking
into it, and now he--

116
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:17,590
the only way to keep
this family safe

117
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:21,210
is for everyone in it to stop
asking questions,

118
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:23,263
including you,
Oliver.

119
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:26,266
Promise me.

120
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,856
So this is really happening.

121
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:37,110
498 hours
of community service to go.

122
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:39,862
499. This orientation
doesn't count.

123
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:42,699
Tell me how this is not
cruel and unusual punishment.

124
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,535
Anastasia, I'd like you
to meet our new intern,

125
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,587
Thea Queen.
Interns get school credit.

126
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:50,006
I'm more like
a court-ordered slave.

127
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:51,240
Oh. I can relate.

128
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:52,592
Anastasia is on
a one year pro-bono

129
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,377
sabbatical
from her law firm.

130
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,963
And apparently
from my six figure salary.

131
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:59,599
The experience of helping others
is its own reward.

132
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,167
I have yet to see
any evidence of that.

133
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:02,835
And speaking a lack of evidence,

134
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,570
Cyrus Vanch was released
from Iron Heights.

135
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:06,606
We represent a victim's
advocacy group

136
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,808
who's trying
to keep Vanch locked up.

137
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,476
I'm calling Kate Spencer.
I already did.

138
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,345
She said there's nothing
the D.A.'s office can do

139
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:13,646
without further evidence.

140
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,181
Well, then I'm going
to her office.

141
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:18,017
And then she also said
not to show up at her office.

142
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,986
Vanch is connected
to human trafficking,

143
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,471
drug running,
racketeering,

144
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,656
and at least 52
different homicides.

145
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:26,125
Ok, so what's the play?
Because unless you have access

146
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,810
to some private police force,

147
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:29,662
Vanch will stay free
to roam the streets.

148
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,716
I have to get this.

149
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,086
Hello?

150
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,839
How does a night with me
and a dozen famous chefs sound?

151
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,091
Like an episode
of "The Bachelor".

152
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,977
I'm auditioning potential chefs
for the club tomorrow night.

153
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,312
I've arranged a tasting,

154
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:48,648
and I could use
an extra set of taste buds.

155
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,216
I'm trying
to figure out how to get

156
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:53,019
a vicious criminal
back in jail. I can't.

157
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,687
It's perfect.
It sounds like hungry work.

158
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,322
Tomorrow night?

159
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:58,057
Maybe, if we could
do it early.

160
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,359
Look, I got to go.

161
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,494
There's someone
I have to call.

162
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:03,579
I'll see you later. Bye.

163
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:06,699
You don't find that
a little convenient,

164
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,251
her just so happening
to have burned the book?

165
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,069
She did it out of concern for
my safety, Diggle.

166
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:13,089
Or her own.
Oliver, you said it yourself.

167
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,241
Whoever compiled that list is
involved in something very dangerous.

168
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:18,177
And if your mother
is lying to you...

169
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,430
And she didn't know
any of the names on the list.

170
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:21,714
She said she didn't.

171
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,082
You don't have to take
her word for it.

172
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,351
Oliver, if this were anybody else,
you'd be hooded up right now

173
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:27,720
on your way to having
an arrow-side chat with them.

174
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:29,755
This isn't anybody else.
This is my mother.

175
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,391
And I know her.

176
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,145
What's that?

177
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:37,864
That is the phone
that I gave to Lance

178
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,315
so that he could
contact the Hood.

179
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:42,318
Is he asking
to turn yourself in?

180
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,488
He gave it
to Laurel. Hello?

181
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,573
I need your help.
That's why you have the phone.

182
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:50,693
Cyrus Vanch was just released
from prison on a technicality.

183
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:53,413
Living large
in his lawyer's house.

184
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,334
Who is now missing.

185
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,753
There's no evidence
of foul play.

186
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:03,005
But I know he's just
Vanch's first victim,

187
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,457
and he won't be
his last.

188
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:05,975
What
about the police?

189
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:07,626
They can't move on him
without evidence

190
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,729
of new criminal
activity.

191
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:12,298
Laurel, obtaining evidence
isn't what I do.

192
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,567
Vanch is dangerous.

193
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:16,986
Hold on to the phone,
I'll call.

194
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:22,074
Laurel needs my help.

195
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:25,311
Oliver, are you running
to help her...

196
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,730
or away from the truth
about your mother?

197
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,451
I have work to do.

198
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:34,954
Hey, Detective?

199
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:36,873
I'm busy, Kelton.

200
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,841
I'm pretty sure you're going to
want to hear this.

201
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:42,345
The bug I put in that phone
from the Vigilante just lit up.

202
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,964
Your daughter's playing
Maid Marion to Robin Hood again.

203
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,050
Where you going?

204
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:50,386
Lieutenant Pike's
office.

205
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,138
If she's meeting
with the Hood,

206
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,857
there's going to be
a task force there when she does.

207
00:09:57,651 --> 00:10:01,651

209
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,615
See, we got to look at all this
as an opportunity.

210
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:21,537
The Triad and the Bertinelli
organization are leaderless.

211
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,172
The giant sucking
sound you're hearing

212
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,874
is the current power vacuum
in Starling City,

213
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,160
the one that
I plan on filling.

214
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:37,936
How are you going to convince
the Triad and Bertinelli's crew

215
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,022
that they should
sign up with you?

216
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,318
Well...

217
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,286
that's an excellent
question.

218
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:56,205
I need to do something.

219
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,407
Something spectacular.

220
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,959
To get their attention
and earn their respect.

221
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,380
You know what
I learned in prison?

222
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:24,983
If you want to be
respected,

223
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:29,021
you find the biggest guy
and you put him down permanent.

224
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:32,691
I think I just found
the biggest guy.

225
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:44,787
This is going to be fun.

226
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:46,372
I even wore
my fat pants.

227
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:47,840
I don't want to know
what those are, do I?

228
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:49,174
Nope.

229
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,746
Ohh.

230
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:55,347
This is work.

231
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,433
It'll just
be a second, okay?

232
00:11:57,435 --> 00:11:59,551
Hello?

233
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,919
It's me. I have something.

234
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,587
Can you meet?

235
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,257
Yeah, where?

236
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,776
Rooftop, Winick building.
30 minutes.

237
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:10,896
Good work, Kelton.

238
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,981
Okay, everybody.

239
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,533
Rubber bullets.
This is my daughter here.

240
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,402
She cannot come
to any harm.

241
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,070
But outside of that,

242
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,089
you do whatever
needs doing

243
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:23,542
to bring that
archer down.

244
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,462
You sure about this?

245
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,330
Look, she knows I'd do anything
to catch this bastard.

246
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,549
And this is the best--
it's the only option I've got.

247
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,885
Look, I want to get this guy
just as badly as you do.

248
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:36,088
I just don't want to see
anything come between you two.

249
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,590
I warned her. I said stay away
from this lunatic.

250
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,225
She didn't.

251
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,294
You don't think that turns
a knife in my back?

252
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,963
I hope she sees it that way.

253
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,572
Mmm, put those
puppy dog eyes away.

254
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,090
Something's
come up at work.

255
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:56,975
That can't wait
until tomorrow?

256
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,828
It'll only be an hour.
I can meet you at the club.

257
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,613
One hour.

258
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,782
An hour and a half.

259
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,751
Tops.

260
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:14,659
Ricky has been driving me

261
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,879
for six years now.

262
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:20,632
I can't remember
the last time he missed a day.

263
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:24,520
Thank you for offering
to fill in, Mr. Diggle.

264
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:28,557
It's my pleasure, Mrs. Queen.
Believe me.

265
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,176
Are you sure my son
won't miss you?

266
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,111
He said he was staying
in for the evening.

267
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,646
And you believed him?

268
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,065
It's been my experience

269
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,235
when your son wants
some alone time,

270
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,955
there's not much I
can do to stop him.

271
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,541
Hmm. Much to my chagrin.

272
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:51,363
You can stop just up ahead.

273
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,184
No need to escort me inside.

274
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,069
I'm fine on my own,
Mr. Diggle.

275
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,738
Of course, Mrs. Queen.

276
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,515
Mr. Diggle.
Mrs. Queen.

277
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,184
I was just, uh,
looking for the restroom.

278
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:51,890
Excuse me, ladies.
Happy Birthday.

279
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,598
Hello, Laurel.

280
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,121
Thank you
for helping.

281
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:07,739
I couldn't do much.

282
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,775
Vanch's position
is too heavily fortified.

283
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,945
But I did get this.

284
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,249
Evidence he's trying
to take over the positions

285
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,717
vacated by Frank Bertinelli

286
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,119
and...

287
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,255
and the Triad.

288
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,173
What's wrong?

289
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,726
We're not alone.
What?!

290
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,629
SCPD!

291
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,114
Get down! Hands
where we can see 'em!

292
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,399
Dad!
Do it now!

293
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,318
You so much as leave
a bruise on her,

294
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,819
and I swear I will
drag you down to hell myself.

295
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,804
Laurel, I'm sorry.

296
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:46,329
Quentin, don't!

297
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:16,317
I don't know what's worse--
the fact that you lied to me

298
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,384
or nearly got me killed!

299
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,219
You were
completely safe.

300
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:21,754
I was on a rooftop

301
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:23,806
with an army of men pointing
their guns in my face!

302
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,675
Well, you shouldn't have been
on that roof in the first place.

303
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:28,294
No! You wanted me
on that roof.

304
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:30,513
Wasn't that the whole point
of your little trap?

305
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,248
I'm trying
to catch a killer.

306
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,933
You manipulated me.

307
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:36,352
Manipulated?
You practically ran to this guy.

308
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,220
I told you, I said stay away from him
and you did not.

309
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:40,072
That was before you gave me the phone!
What?!

310
00:16:40,074 --> 00:16:43,009
That's before you realized
that you could use me as bait.

311
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,910
Your own daughter.

312
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:46,445
Yeah, but you wouldn't
listen to me!

313
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,197
You are so blinded
by your hate for him

314
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,582
that you don't
realize the damage

315
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,117
that it's doing
in your own life.

316
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,152
To your family.

317
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:55,671
So what happens
when you catch him?

318
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:57,623
What happens then, Dad?

319
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,759
You're going to find
another criminal;

320
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:02,328
somebody else to blame
for mom leaving?

321
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,997
For Sarah dying,
for your drinking?

322
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:08,017
That's enough,
Laurel.

323
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,169
Yeah, you're damn right, it is.

324
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,306
Laurel!

325
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,862
The phone.

326
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:23,816
Give me the phone.

327
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,993
Laurel could have
been hurt, or worse.

328
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:36,862
And I suppose
that was Lance's fault.

329
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,964
What's your point, Dig?

330
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,067
Just that you don't really see
straight when it comes to Laurel.

331
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,501
Or your mother.

332
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:44,503
This is not the time

333
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,022
to bring
this up again.

334
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,973
Ok. Ok.

335
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,675
But there's something
I should tell you

336
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,543
and it's better
I tell you now than later.

337
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:53,963
I'll be driving your mother
around for a few days.

338
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:55,798
You're spying on her?!
Just doing my due diligence,

339
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,051
Oliver. See if she meets with
anyone we might be interested in.

340
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:00,569
She's not a suspect.

341
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:02,104
She's my mother.

342
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:04,323
Which is exactly
why someone needs to take

343
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,158
a close, objective
look at her.

344
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,613
Oliver, something's going on
in this city. You know it.

345
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:13,899
That doesn't mean
she's involved.

346
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,980
Then there's no harm
in me driving her around

347
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,649
for a few days, is there?

348
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:35,254
I still can't believe it.
He used me as bait!

349
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:37,473
Who?
My father.

350
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:39,642
He was trying
to catch the Vigilante.

351
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:41,360
He eavesdropped on my phone
conversation with him

352
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:43,262
and then lied in wait
with his jack boots.

353
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:45,264
This was tonight?
Yes.

354
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,116
While you were working.

355
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:48,651
This was work.

356
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:51,287
So you met up with the Hood guy?
Knowingly?

357
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,989
He's contacted me before.

358
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:55,741
He helped me
with the Declan case

359
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,827
and Joanna's arson
investigation.

360
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:00,045
The Declan case
was months ago.

361
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:02,998
I know, Tommy, I've been
wanting to tell you.

362
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,300
Laurel,
he's a murderer!

363
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:05,468
God.

364
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,420
You sound like my father.

365
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:09,555
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but he's right.

366
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:11,957
Are you seriously
taking his side?

367
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,677
He's been lying
to me for weeks!

368
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,146
Yeah, it feels like
crap, doesn't it?

369
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:21,434
Tommy!

370
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:25,404
A sting operation to catch
the notorious Starling City vigilante

371
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,022
wreaked havoc last night.

372
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:28,941
Despite the police's
failed attempt

373
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,493
to apprehend the Vigilante,

374
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,111
police have continued to insist

375
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:33,946
that their warnings remain.

376
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:36,949
This archer is to be
considered armed and dangerous.

377
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:38,584
Should you find yourself in
harm's way, always always,

378
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,619
call 9-1-1.

379
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:45,040
Interesting.

380
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:48,294
Using deception
and intimidation

381
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:50,095
to make a name
for himself.

382
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:53,182
This guy
stole my move.

383
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,336
I have news.

384
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:00,606
From my friend
in the police department.

385
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:04,026
I think I've figured out a way to
get the Hood out and into the open.

386
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,528
Huh.

387
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,446
Astonish me.

388
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:10,115
Remember that attorney?

389
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:12,535
Laurel Lance?

390
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,858
Now what's wrong
with this picture?

391
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,911
You look like
you're...working.

392
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:24,163
I'm going
over résumes

393
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:26,665
for the Chef's position
at the nightclub.

394
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,034
This guy looks pretty good.
He won "Top Chef" Season Six.

395
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:30,586
At this point,
it is basically

396
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:32,704
a culinary prerequisite
to be on that show.

397
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,840
Ohh.

398
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:37,059
Can I talk to you
about something?

399
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,228
Tommy...

400
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,826
Every time you want
to talk to me about something

401
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:42,519
and that something is Laurel,
you look like you're about

402
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:44,148
to tell me you have
a terminal disease.

403
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,855
She's been working
with the Hood guy.

404
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,323
What?

405
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:54,360
You're letting her work
with that crazy person?

406
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:55,611
She could get hurt, Tommy.

407
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:57,729
I'm not "letting"
her do anything, okay?

408
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,365
I only just
found out about it

409
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,200
because she accidentally
slipped up

410
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:03,402
on one
of her many lies.

411
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:06,755
She's lying to you?
That doesn't sound like Laurel.

412
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:09,375
Lying, keeping secrets
about who she's spending time with--

413
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:11,577
does that remind you
of anybody we know?

414
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:14,530
Me, in every relationship
that I've been in.

415
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:17,683
Me, too.
Except this one.

416
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:23,689
There's some sort of infatuation
thing going on here.

417
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:24,923
I...

418
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:27,142
We both know
that she has

419
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:29,061
a pretty strong
track record

420
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,922
of being attracted to
guys who are dangerous,

421
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:32,649
who break the rules.

422
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,936
Show me a more dangerous
rule breaker than the Hood.

423
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:39,238
I just think you need to have
an honest chat with her.

424
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,108
Find out the real reason
she's keeping secrets.

425
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,243
I just can't
believe that Laurel,

426
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:46,378
of all people,
would lie to my face.

427
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,213
I guess that's
the way that it is

428
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:50,282
with the people
that you're closest to.

429
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:52,601
I know.

430
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:57,623
But talk to her anyway,
and fix this.

431
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,943
Before it becomes
something that's unfixable.

432
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,205
Shéngcun.

433
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:13,672
It's Chinese.
It means sur--

434
00:22:13,674 --> 00:22:15,591
Survive.

435
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:19,862
What do you think he meant,
besides not getting killed?

436
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:22,314
There's an airfield
10 clicks from here.

437
00:22:22,316 --> 00:22:24,583
It's key off this island.

438
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:26,485
Yao Fei and I had been
observing it for months,

439
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:29,755
familiarizing ourselves
with their operations.

440
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:32,257
We were supposed to get off
this island together.

441
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,443
But then Yao Fei
was compromised,

442
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,762
and we were separated.

443
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:45,137
What's this for?

444
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:46,889
I think Yao Fei sent you

445
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:49,508
because he knows
I cannot take the airstrip alone.

446
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,126
Sounds like Yao Fei.

447
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:54,396
He is a softer judge
of character than I am.

448
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:56,682
If you're going
to have my back,

449
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:59,518
I need to know
you can cover it.

450
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:06,542
What are you doing?

451
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:09,361
Fight back.

452
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:13,298
Keep your blade up.
Always stay

453
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,534
behind your sword.

454
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:24,326
You have no skill.
No strength.

455
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:26,345
No training.

456
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:29,982
To say you fight like a girl
would be a compliment.

457
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:32,434
I told you--
I'm not a soldier.

458
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:34,019
I was shipwrecked here.
I killed the guy

459
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,655
that was wearing
this uniform by accident.

460
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:39,057
Where was Yao Fei?

461
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,245
He told me to run.

462
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:45,731
And I did.

463
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:53,172
Hey, it's Tommy,
hit me on the beep.

464
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:56,908
Hey, it's me again.

465
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,545
Please call me back.

466
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,747
I think
we should talk.

467
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:08,387
I was just
leaving you a message.

468
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:35,614
I love a girl who can take
care of herself.

469
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,471
But can't block a taser.

470
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,019
Oh, no need to get out
of the car, Mr. Diggle.

471
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,586
It's just my accountant.

472
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,255
The only threat is boredom.

473
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:07,640
Well, it's no
problem at all,

474
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:09,225
Mrs. Queen.
It's my job.

475
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:10,693
Yes. Well, then,
take the night off.

476
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:14,080
I'm quite all right.

477
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,832
It's taken care of.

478
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,434
I've taken care of it.

479
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:28,087
Carl Ballard will not be
a problem anymore.

480
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,889
Given your propensity
for squeamishness,

481
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:33,342
I'm assuming that Mr. Ballard
remains in good health.

482
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,244
I made it clear
to him persuasively

483
00:26:35,246 --> 00:26:38,180
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

484
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,499
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

485
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,734
Excellent.

486
00:26:41,736 --> 00:26:44,820
Now, one more matter
to attend to.

487
00:26:44,822 --> 00:26:48,491
I need you to have
to contents of this address

488
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:52,628
removed and disposed of
thoroughly.

489
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,424
The warehouse where
you're storing the remains

490
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,449
of "the Queen's Gambit".

491
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:01,470
I already told you, I knew
Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

492
00:27:01,472 --> 00:27:06,142
And I don't think it serves for
anyone to find evidence of that.

493
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:07,476
Do you?

494
00:27:07,478 --> 00:27:09,728
What the hell
are you doing?

495
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,048
Nothin'. Just hangin'.

496
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,001
I work for Mrs. Queen.

497
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:19,271
And I work security for
the man she's meeting with.

498
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,923
I guess that means
we're on the same team.

499
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:23,442
I don't think so.
And I'm going to need to see

500
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:25,361
what you put
in your pocket just then.

501
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:27,580
What are you, man,
the police?

502
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:29,148
Show it to me.

503
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,267
Do it now.

504
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:34,069
Right.

505
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:41,260
Just thought I could come in
here and ruin my lungs a little bit.

506
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:45,281
I know,
it's a filthy habit.

507
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,387
Laurel, it's me.
Can we talk?

508
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:57,443
Laurel?

509
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:06,785
Laurel?

510
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:18,781
Make sure this message
finds its way to the Vigilante.

511
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,666
Do it fast,
because at sunrise,

512
00:28:20,668 --> 00:28:23,785
I'm going to leave pieces
of this girl all over Starling City

513
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,504
unless he pays me
a little visit.

514
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:29,091
You know, gives us a chance
to get to know each other better.

515
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,466
What do we do?

516
00:28:37,468 --> 00:28:39,568
Can your CSIs,
I don't know,

517
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,087
can they track this
or trace it or something?

518
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,323
How did he know
about Laurel?

519
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:45,908
What?

520
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,309
How does this guy know

521
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:50,913
Laurel is connected
to the Hood?

522
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:52,414
I have no idea.

523
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,650
I only found out about it
myself last night.

524
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:57,670
She--she said you knew.

525
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,988
Well, just me and...

526
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:08,631
Mr. Lance,
this maniac has got Laurel!

527
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:12,000
You got to call in
posse or something,

528
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,503
I don't know, SWAT teams.
I can't.

529
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:18,507
Detective Lance...

530
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:22,361
I got to go
make a call.

531
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:35,844
Thanks for coming.

532
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:38,245
It didn't seem like a good idea
to talk about this at your house.

533
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:40,014
Yeah, it would have been
a little awkward

534
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:42,216
for you to explain to my mother
that you're spying on her.

535
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:43,751
No, man.

536
00:29:43,753 --> 00:29:45,419
Awkward part's
coming up.

537
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:47,438
You bugged
my mother?

538
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,590
Just listen.

539
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,429
It's taken care of.

540
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:57,148
I've taken care of it.

541
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,383
Carl Ballard will not be
a problem anymore.

542
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,485
Given your propensity
for squeamishness,

543
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:04,822
I'm assuming that Mr. Ballard
remains in good health.

544
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:07,108
I made it clear
to him persuasively

545
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,443
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

546
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:12,446
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

547
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:13,831
Excellent.

548
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,250
Now, one more matter
to attend to.

549
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:19,587
I need you to have
to contents of this address

550
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:23,140
removed and disposed of
thoroughly.

551
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:24,424
The warehouse where
you're storing the remains

552
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,144
of "the Queen's Gambit".

553
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:29,931
I already told you, I knew
Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

554
00:30:30,984 --> 00:30:32,717
I'm sorry, man.

555
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:36,420
The yacht was sabotaged.

556
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:39,357
Somebody tried
to kill my father.

557
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,908
And your mother
was involved somehow.

558
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,911
You do not know
that she was involved, Diggle!

559
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:46,130
What I do know Oliver,
and so do you,

560
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:48,950
is that she kept this a secret.

561
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:51,786
Why would she do that if she
didn't have something to hide?

562
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:55,339
Is that...?
Yeah!

563
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:57,873
You have three seconds
before I have this line

564
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,661
permanently disconnected.

565
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:02,329
It's Laurel.
She's been kidnapped.

566
00:31:02,331 --> 00:31:04,181
Listen, whoever this is,

567
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:06,434
he's going to kill my daughter.

568
00:31:06,436 --> 00:31:08,769
Please believe me.

569
00:31:18,614 --> 00:31:21,015
Sorry.

570
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,618
It's nothing personal.

571
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,455
The airfield was a very
heavily fortified position.

572
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:29,356
I've been there.

573
00:31:29,358 --> 00:31:31,626
And I cannot
take it on my own.

574
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,411
So--so what?!

575
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,379
Huh? You're just
going to kill me?

576
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:38,165
Like I said...

577
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:40,200
It's nothing personal.

578
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,753
But if you're alive,
they will find you.

579
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:45,006
And if they find you,
they will torture you

580
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,841
until you give up my location,

581
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:49,427
and I cannot allow
for that to happen.

582
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,262
Hey, don't leave! No, please don't
do this, all right?!

583
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:53,014
I'm not going to say
anything to that--

584
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,018
Don't make it
more difficult upon yourself.

585
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,853
I can do this
in a way

586
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:01,072
that you will not
feel it at all.

587
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:16,587
Ahhh!

588
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:24,244
Steve Wilson.
Oliver Queen.

589
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,797
Well, Oliver Queen...

590
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,250
There might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

591
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,117
Detective.

592
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,902
If this is another trick,

593
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:50,237
you will not like
the consequences.

594
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:54,125
I'm not particularly
happy right now.

595
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:57,661
I hate you.
I hate everything you stand for.

596
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:00,998
But this lunatic
has my little girl.

597
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,050
He left this behind
as some kind of ransom note.

598
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:05,136
His name is Cyrus Vanch.

599
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:06,954
Jeez...

600
00:33:06,956 --> 00:33:09,289
He'll kill her if he
doesn't get to you.

601
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,975
He'll kill her anyway.

602
00:33:10,977 --> 00:33:13,060
So why come to me?

603
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:15,346
It's a pretty tight
circle that knows

604
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:17,565
about you and my daughter
working together.

605
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:20,568
If Vanch knows, it's because someone
at the precinct talked.

606
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,355
There isn't anybody else
I could trust.

607
00:33:24,357 --> 00:33:25,940
Vanch is holed up
in a mansion.

608
00:33:25,942 --> 00:33:27,608
It's a heavily
fortified position.

609
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,344
I was there. I can't
take it by myself.

610
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:33,664
I need your help.

611
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:37,485
Then I need yours.

612
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,024
Time's running out.

613
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,191
And still no visit
from your friend.

614
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,861
I might have overestimated his
fondness for you.

615
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,184
Assault with intent.

616
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:02,537
And kidnapping.

617
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:06,024
You're going to rot in prison
for life this time.

618
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,859
That's assuming

619
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:10,329
your hooded BFF
saves you.

620
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:14,433
And his chances
of survival are not so great.

621
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:16,868
He's going up
against trained men

622
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,370
with their fingers
on the trigger

623
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:21,540
of guns that fire up to
600 rounds per minute.

624
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:22,758
Now, I'm no Einstein,

625
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,560
but that is a lot
of bullets.

626
00:34:37,323 --> 00:34:40,192
And even if he were
to take them out,

627
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:42,994
I have two sharpshooters
on the roof.

628
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:55,457
And even if he were
to get by them,

629
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:57,659
what's he going to do against
the veritable army

630
00:34:57,661 --> 00:35:00,245
of sons of bitches
I've got waiting for him?

631
00:35:11,257 --> 00:35:13,108
Now, as I said,

632
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,593
I'm no Einstein.

633
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:17,863
But I can count to 24.

634
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,531
And in case
you're wondering--

635
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,316
I was so I studied up
on my news footage--

636
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:25,203
24 is the exact number
of arrows he carries in his quiver

637
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:28,457
and flechettes
around his forearm.

638
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:38,783
Lose the bow,
Merida.

639
00:35:40,786 --> 00:35:42,421
Ventilate him.

640
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:52,130
My daughter!
My little girl!

641
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:59,804
I'm the Vigilante.
You're the cop.

642
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:06,328
That doesn't mean I have to read
the bastard his rights, though.

643
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:11,649
Laurel, are you ok?

644
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:14,319
Yeah.

645
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,955
I'm ok.

646
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,467
All right,
you're good to go.

647
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:31,186
I'll, uh, I'll take you
home now.

648
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:34,222
I can take a cab.

649
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:36,775
Laurel, you had a trauma.
I'll drive you home.

650
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,094
No.
What?

651
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,030
I'm going to need you to keep
your distance for a while.

652
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:44,816
Laurel...

653
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,702
Dad, I love you.

654
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:50,622
I'll always love you.

655
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:53,959
But what I can't do right now
is trust you.

656
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,293
I was just doing my job.

657
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:57,162
I thought you'd understand
at least that.

658
00:36:57,164 --> 00:36:58,797
That part I do understand.

659
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:03,802
But lying to me,
using me...

660
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,504
It's going to take longer.

661
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:30,502
Are you all right?

662
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:32,270
What would you think if I said
I didn't know?

663
00:37:32,272 --> 00:37:35,123
That you were being honest.

664
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,976
My father
has the phone now.

665
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:41,479
And I don't think he'll be
giving it back any time soon.

666
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:44,115
Maybe that's good.

667
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:47,485
I didn't see how
it would put you in danger.

668
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,237
I'm a big girl.

669
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,840
I knew the risks.

670
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:54,059
Now I know them.

671
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:57,278
And I'm not willing
to take them with you.

672
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,897
What does that mean?

673
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:00,415
It means good-bye.

674
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,283
Laurel!

675
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:04,169
Laurel.

676
00:38:06,455 --> 00:38:08,540
Oh, my God, Laurel.

677
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,592
Laurel, tell me
you are okay, please.

678
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:12,961
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm so sorry.

679
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:14,546
No, no,
it doesn't matter,

680
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:17,348
just as long
as you're okay.

681
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:27,508
You know, this does not
change anything

682
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,177
between you and I.

683
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:32,163
It takes two men
to take the air field.

684
00:38:32,165 --> 00:38:34,449
And if you compromise
my getting off this island,

685
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:36,151
I will kill you.

686
00:38:36,153 --> 00:38:38,186
You've had
your second chance.

687
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:41,356
You need me
just as much as I need you.

688
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,643
So what's our next step?

689
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:48,379
Turning you into something
that won't get us both killed.

690
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:51,015
Choose a weapon.

691
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:53,968
We're starting now?

692
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:16,224
That's mine.

693
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:20,578
You are the lunatic
who tortured me?!

694
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,030
No, that was another guy.
Bull!

695
00:39:22,032 --> 00:39:25,350
This mask, it's my
operational equivalent

696
00:39:25,352 --> 00:39:26,835
to a balaclava.

697
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:28,453
My partner
and I wore them

698
00:39:28,455 --> 00:39:31,405
to keep our identities
classified during our missions.

699
00:39:31,407 --> 00:39:33,124
You're lying.

700
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:40,265
Fyers told me this nutcase
is a prisoner on the island.

701
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:42,550
He lied to you.

702
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,585
My partner and I came
here to free Yao Fei

703
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:46,938
and get him
off this island.

704
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,474
We're A.S.I.S.

705
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:52,260
Australian
intelligence.

706
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:54,428
Now.

707
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,431
You are going to find
your silver weapon.

708
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,267
Have you considered
a sword?

709
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:02,437
I like swords.

710
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:04,706
I made it clear
to him persuasively

711
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:07,242
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

712
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:09,761
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

713
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:15,216
I've listened
to this 15 times.

714
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:19,387
It's definitely her
voice, Diggle. I just...

715
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:23,174
I can't believe
it's her.

716
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:25,944
We all have blind spots
when it comes to family.

717
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,596
Yeah. Laurel's almost
got her killed tonight.

718
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:30,765
Vanch never would have known
about her connection to me

719
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,717
if Lance hadn't
have lied to her.

720
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,104
I guess the lesson here
is blind trust can be dangerous.

721
00:40:39,276 --> 00:40:41,259
I made it clear
to him persuasively

722
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:43,811
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

723
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:46,414
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

724
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:49,417
What's the undertaking?

725
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:50,885
I don't know.

726
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:52,653
But with all this
talk about threats,

727
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:54,756
it can't be good.

728
00:40:56,258 --> 00:40:59,127
You warned me that
if she was lying

729
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:01,930
would be to cover up her
involvement in something dangerous.

730
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:05,783
I need to know what
The Undertaking is.

731
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:11,306
What are you going to do?

732
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,065
I need to have another
chat with my mom.

733
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:25,740
I'll need the Unidac merger
finalized by the end of the week.

734
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:28,608
We're on something
of a clock here.

735
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,421
Moira Queen,

736
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:44,758
you have failed this city.

737
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:49,783
