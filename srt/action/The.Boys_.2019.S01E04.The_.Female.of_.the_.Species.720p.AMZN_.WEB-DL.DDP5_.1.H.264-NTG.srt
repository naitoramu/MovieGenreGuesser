1
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,810
- Come on.
- Mm-mm.

2
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,639
- Just come with.
- Nuh-uh.

3
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,774
- Please?
- No fucking way.

4
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,822
This may be
their last reunion tour ever.

5
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,067
Yeah, I fucking hope so.

6
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,359
They're the best band.

7
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,152
Oh, come off it.

8
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,566
Look, I ain't stopping you.
If you really want to go,

9
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,735
I'll buy you front row seats.
You can take Rachel.

10
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,584
I don't want to take Rachel.

11
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,079
I want you to come with me.

12
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,251
I would be forced to chop
my fucking ears off.

13
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,018
- I'll make a mess everywhere.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,632
Then I would just have
to clean it up.

15
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,298
- You would?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,297
Smart-ass.

17
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,969
You love it.

18
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,967
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

19
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,469
Yeah.

20
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,445
- Hi.
- Good morning.

21
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,708
Morning, Deputy Director.

22
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,089
How did you get in here?

23
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,129
You're like the fucking mold

24
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,673
on my laundry room tiles.

25
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,676
You scrape it off,
comes right back.

26
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,969
Sounds like you got a little bit
of a moisture problem, luv.

27
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,135
Security, please.

28
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,604
I can stop 'em getting Supes
in the military.

29
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,605
What makes you think I care?

30
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,727
Personally, I can't wait
until they're in Syria.

31
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,025
Yeah, I'll bet.

32
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,610
Last week.

33
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,815
A-Train, mainlining

34
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,445
before the big race.
His fuck buddy,

35
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,872
Popclaw,

36
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,410
pinning the same stuff.

37
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,214
They call it Compound V.
It's some kind of

38
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,957
booster or steroid for Supes.

39
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,169
Jacks 'em right up.

40
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,249
Now, word gets out that Supes

41
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,004
are nothing but a bunch
of juice junkies,

42
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,666
no one's gonna want 'em
in national defense.

43
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,925
Mm-hmm.

44
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,967
Got a sample?

45
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,760
Not yet.

46
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:22,764
Mm.

47
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,255
This could be heroin.

48
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,976
It could be anything.

49
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,306
You don't trust me.

50
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,351
Susan, I am shocked and saddened
by that.

51
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,345
Really?

52
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,516
I'm sure.

53
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,153
Speaking of which,

54
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,650
I haven't seen Translucent
around anywhere.

55
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,243
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

56
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,659
Cunt's invisible.

57
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,488
He could be standing
in that fucking corner,

58
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,743
plugging one out right now,
for all we know.

59
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,035
Look, you think Supes
are cunts now?

60
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,251
You just wait till
they're wearing camo.

61
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,001
I mean, what's to stop
Sergeant Homelander

62
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,253
from killing a couple
of hundred thousand Chinese?

63
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,415
How are you gonna try him
for war crimes?

64
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,858
He's gonna murder
the bloody lot of us

65
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,682
before he steps one foot
in The Hague.

66
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,968
I mean, you might as well
hand the bloody launch keys

67
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,432
over to Vought right now.

68
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,404
You're really working
this one, huh?

69
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,567
Just being
an upstanding citizen, luv.

70
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,776
Oh, I know.

71
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,777
Okay.

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,070
You get me some hard proof,

73
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,204
something actionable
that I can use,

74
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:29,162
and maybe I'll throw you
a few bucks.

75
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,294
For your operating costs.

76
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,171
But if you fuck me on this,

77
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,053
for the rest of your life,
you'll be drinking your own piss

78
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,891
at a black site.

79
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,307
Say you understand.

80
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:51,266
See, now, Susan, this is why
it never went anywhere with us.

81
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,940
You can't have two alpha males,
'cause inevitably someone's...

82
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,149
Say you fucking understand.

83
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:02,242
I understand.

84
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,529
Remind me, what was our deal?

85
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,493
- What?
- What was our fucking deal?

86
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,164
Go to hell. I already told you,
A-Train runs the Compound...

87
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,745
Yeah, runs the Compound V to
the noodle shop up on Division.

88
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,541
We've been up on it all week
and we ain't seen fuck all.

89
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,705
Well, wherever he's going,
it's around there,

90
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,594
because every time
he leaves with the V,

91
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,859
he comes back with the sesame
noodles. That's all I know.

92
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,593
Well, you'd better
be right, love,

93
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,135
or you and your dearly
departed landlord

94
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,929
are gonna find yourselves
on Pornhub

95
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,812
in the Fatal Cunnilingus
section.

96
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,099
You son of a bitch,
if you even...

97
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,265
Sorry, baby, just, work's

98
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,146
just been a motherfucker lately.

99
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,129
You know I'd much rather be
at home, rubbing on them toes

100
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,589
than out here breaking up
yard fights,

101
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,953
but you know, a brother
got to get paid, right?

102
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,490
Oh, most definitely.

103
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,954
Payday comes, we gonna be
all up in Kay Jewelers,

104
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,754
tearing it down.

105
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,328
Champagne showers.

106
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,035
I know, I know,
I'm just kidding.

107
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,206
All right, sweetheart.
Talk to you.

108
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,549
Say something.

109
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,182
Well, you know,
Jean-Paul Sartre said

110
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:16,274
marriage stifles
our essential male urges.

111
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,271
Jean-Paul Sartre also died
a old, lonely motherfucker.

112
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,984
Not to mention his girl

113
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,574
was shacking up
with some other dude.

114
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,649
Uh, oui.
They were free to explore.

115
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,945
Explore what? Gonorrhea?

116
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,949
Come on, Frenchie.

117
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,331
Why work so motherfucking hard
if you don't have somebody

118
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,368
to go home to and sleep
next to at night?

119
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,212
Well, I go to sleep next to
someone different every night.

120
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,101
Yeah, and that's 'cause you're
an old, lonely fucker, too.

121
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,125
- And you're gonna die by yourself.
- Mm.

122
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,129
Well, if you and Monique
have something so pure,

123
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,171
why are you lying to her
about where you are?

124
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,600
Noodle Guy. He's packing.

125
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,064
About time we see something.

126
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,812
We got to go in there, don't we?

127
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,726
Don't be scared, petit Hughie.

128
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:48,025
Will you stop calling me that?
I'm, like, six feet tall.

129
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,519
Let's hurry up, let's go.

130
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,923
Check those boxes.

131
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,644
Frenchie, look for the V.

132
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,440
Frenchie, come on, let's go,

133
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,478
Check these boxes.

134
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,361
Come on, Frenchie,
what are you doing?

135
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,494
Are you deaf?

136
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,543
Jesus.

137
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,461
Who's that?

138
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,461
I think we should let her go.

139
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,553
No, no, no, no, no, uh-uh. We're
here for the V, and we get out.

140
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,260
This isn't a rescue.

141
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
You sound like Butcher.

142
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,644
I sound like a motherfucker
that wants to be breathing.

143
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,055
Goddamn it, Frenchie,
what the...

144
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,395
Hey! Don't set her free!

145
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,277
Oh, my God!

146
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,803
Oh, fuck.

147
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,836
Hughie, let's go!
Let's go, Hughie!

148
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,010
Come on!

149
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:40,032
Couple weeks ago,
we were all getting...

150
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,075
we were all getting wasted
in the common room.

151
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,499
It was, like,
Super Bowl, I think.

152
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,290
And I don't know.
Maybe I was just drunk, but...

153
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,962
...you know, I tried.

154
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,680
I-I really tried...

155
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,798
to talk to the guys.

156
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,806
About...?

157
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,598
Dolphins.

158
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,732
Did you know, in Japan,
that they

159
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,269
hunt down and slaughter
20,000 dolphins a year?

160
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,273
Intelligent animals.

161
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,605
Yeah,
that have regional accents, and

162
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,862
a great sense of humor.
I mean, they're...

163
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,874
They're hilarious.

164
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,866
Yeah.

165
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,789
And that night, A-Train

166
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:31,249
thought it'd be funny to stick
a blow-up dolphin in my bed.

167
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,753
With lipstick on its blowhole.

168
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,045
Yeah, real creative pricks.

169
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,511
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,683
That must have hurt.

171
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,192
Yeah, I'm-I'm...
I'm the diversity hire.

172
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,557
I'm a joke.

173
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,525
I mean, yeah,
I can talk to fish. So what?

174
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,869
How often do you need to be
saved by a school of salmon?

175
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,987
Kevin, that's just not true.

176
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,705
Where would that Carnival
cruise ship be without you?

177
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,667
Yeah. I know.

178
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:19,171
Okay, I need to...
self-actualize,

179
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,426
show more confidence.

180
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,717
After all, who are you?

181
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,892
I'm one of The Seven.

182
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,521
And what does that mean?

183
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,177
I can do anything
I set my mind to.

184
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,056
What do you want
to set your mind to?

185
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,723
What a mess.

186
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,048
You all right?

187
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,345
I mean, just when you think

188
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,782
this shit can't get
any more horrible...

189
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,176
Nah, don't worry.

190
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,394
It can get a lot more horrible.

191
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,827
Butcher, come check this out.

192
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,458
Take a look.

193
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,299
V.

194
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,353
So, A-Train's running it here,

195
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,718
and these blokes are dosing
the Asian bird with it.

196
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,034
Yeah, back when
they had eyeballs.

197
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,308
Yeah, but why?

198
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,942
Is it a Vought thing or,
like, a side hustle?

199
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,690
Came gift-wrapped in this.

200
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,147
Find out where it came from.

201
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,275
I'll shake a few trees.

202
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,279
Why the hell were they
dosing her?

203
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,486
Why don't we ask
foie gras over here?

204
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,496
He's the one that let her out.

205
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,578
- She looked innocent.
- Innocent?

206
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:19,134
She's locked up
in a cage, underground,

207
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,629
with two armed guards?

208
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,300
I had a feeling about her.

209
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,589
Nah, Frenchie,
you just didn't follow the plan.

210
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,013
You never follow the plan, man.

211
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,801
You need to unclench
your asshole.

212
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,304
You need to eat
my clenched asshole,

213
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,032
- how 'bout that?
- Why are you two carrying on

214
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,136
like a bunch of fucking twats?

215
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,535
We're sniffing down
a shit sandwich

216
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,939
the size of Watergate.

217
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,897
Vought and the Supes are both
gonna be looking for her.

218
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,068
All we got to do is
find the female first.

219
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,494
Keep looking.

220
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,912
Who's that, then, eh?

221
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,833
It's nobody.

222
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,051
"Annie?" Starlight?

223
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,108
Yeah, it's nothing.
I mean, we were supposed to

224
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,342
go on a date.

225
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,554
Not a date, just, she asked me

226
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,554
if I wanted to ask her
for her number,

227
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,823
and then we just
kind of platonically

228
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,116
exchanged information,
but the...

229
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,520
the word "date" was
never mentioned.

230
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,559
Call her back right now.
You're fucking going.

231
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:23,073
As a rule, I don't usually
go out after a gory massacre.

232
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,898
Listen, here's the job.

233
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,363
You're gonna hot mic her phone.

234
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,703
From now on, we hear
everything she says.

235
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,068
I mean,
this is a golden opportunity.

236
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,446
And after all you done,
piece of cake.

237
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,504
Yeah, she's not a...
She's not a bad person.

238
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,165
She's a Supe, Hughie.

239
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,761
Just like the fucking rest
of them.

240
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,613
Okay, we are not gonna
be able to cover this up forever.

241
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,007
Translucent does not
show his face soon,

242
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,426
people are gonna start
to notice.

243
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,702
What if we just
get in front of it?

244
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,636
Tell the world
he died tragically

245
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,146
in the service of his country.

246
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,647
We could have an amazing
funeral, bigger than Kennedy's.

247
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,940
I don't know, admit that
one of our unkillable

248
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,614
superheroes just got killed?

249
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,362
Kiss that military bill
good-bye.

250
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,914
Let's not overthink it.

251
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,817
We just say he's on
a classified mission.

252
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,696
We can't say where, in the
interest of national security.

253
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,139
All we can say is
he's fighting MS-13.

254
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,413
Ooh, yes. That's good.

255
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,956
Simple. Done. Boom.

256
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,079
MS-13. I like it.

257
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,496
Hello?

258
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,675
What? When?

259
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,305
How many people know?

260
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,966
Seven minutes ago,

261
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,345
Trans-Oceanic Flight 37
from Paris to Chicago

262
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,562
was hijacked mid-air.

263
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,983
- Seven minutes ago?
- Yeah.

264
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,651
A source from NORAD
gave us a heads up.

265
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,899
How many hijackers?

266
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,001
Well, looks like three.

267
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,775
Did they scramble F-16's?

268
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,488
Yep, as we speak.

269
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,238
But you can get there quicker.

270
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,221
Can I please have the room?

271
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,097
Oh, middle of the Atlantic.

272
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,501
- Yep.
- No-man's-land.

273
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,460
You can't operate
on foreign soil,

274
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,711
but a plane hijacked
over international waters...

275
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,513
If you intercept,
no one will protest.

276
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,007
If you bring those passengers
back alive,

277
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,261
not one congressman
will have the balls

278
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,223
to vote against our bill.

279
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,183
Mm-hmm.

280
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,896
This is our chance.

281
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,189
More important than Translucent.

282
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,074
More important than anything.

283
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,199
Concentrated halothane.

284
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,704
It's not a guarantee,

285
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,036
but it should knock out
your girl.

286
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,962
Merci, pumpkin.

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,960
I must go; this girl,
she's got a head start.

288
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,712
Hey, I miss you.

289
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,086
I got us a pied-á-terre
on the Bowery.

290
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,465
When will you be coming by?

291
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:01,522
As soon as I can.

292
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,518
Promise.

293
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,559
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,273
Don't make me use
that gas on you,

295
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,145
huh, pumpkin?

296
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,782
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,029
- Okay.
- Mm. Oh...

298
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,071
Mm.

299
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,354
Fuck!

300
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,105
When will they intercept?

301
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,147
Corporal, I don't care
who is in the room with you,

302
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,900
I need a goddamn update.

303
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,823
Jesus.

304
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,822
Hey. Do you have a second?

305
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,534
It is not really a good time.

306
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,834
I'd really appreciate it.
Super quick.

307
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,408
- Pretty please? Thank you.
- No... Oh, okay.

308
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,374
So... I found a mission.

309
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,576
Uh-huh.

310
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:13,416
And I think
it's really important.

311
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:16,053
And I'd like to do it,
with your permission, of course.

312
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,380
What? Where?

313
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,466
- Oceanland.
- Oceanland?

314
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:26,102
Yeah. So, get this,
the dolphins there,

315
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:30,482
I mean, they are really underfed
and abused.

316
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,321
To be quite honest,
they're really frustrated.

317
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,149
And I'd like to, you know,
just shine a light on it.

318
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,485
I think people would
really respond to that.

319
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,240
You do realize that you are
at the centerpiece

320
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,544
of the Oceanland fall campaign?

321
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,748
Yeah, well, I mean, we could
just bail on that, right?

322
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,249
The deal sucks anyways.

323
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,790
No, we can't.

324
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,383
Listen, I'd just like to,
you know,

325
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,338
maybe do something
with a little more substance.

326
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,300
Okay.

327
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,470
- Yeah?
- I hear you. Yes.

328
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,548
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

329
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,642
Deep...

330
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,929
play to your strengths.

331
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,703
Hey. baby.

332
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,619
Hey...

333
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,867
What'd you do?

334
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,625
What the hell are you
talking about?

335
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,048
Who did you tell about
Compound V?

336
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,798
Nobody. Why? What...

337
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,801
Because you're the only
person who knew, other than me,

338
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:46,264
that I had it...
where I was taking it.

339
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,925
I-I didn't tell anyone anything.

340
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,266
You're being paranoid.

341
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,310
Who else did you fucking tell?!

342
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,528
Don't yell at me.

343
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,030
Listen to me.

344
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,073
Sit down.

345
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,841
Look, I love you.
You know I do.

346
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,381
I've loved you since
the first time that we met.

347
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,545
Oh, really?
I heard you at the race.

348
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,505
No girlfriend.
Open to offers.

349
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,426
Come on, I have to say
those things.

350
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,725
You know this.
They make me.

351
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,270
It's my brand.

352
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,647
Come here.

353
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,155
Come here.

354
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,249
You remember when you relapsed?

355
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,657
Yes.

356
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,035
And I stayed and I rubbed
your back.

357
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,383
Cleaned up your puke.

358
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,341
I'm there for you, always.

359
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,014
I know, baby.

360
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,733
Please,

361
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,518
tell me who you told.

362
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,192
'Cause we're in trouble.
We're in a lot of trouble.

363
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,782
I didn't tell anyone.

364
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,176
Either way, you're gonna
have to pack a bag,

365
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,718
so get everything that you need.

366
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,852
Why? Where are we going?

367
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,889
I'm gonna take care of this,

368
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,893
but until I do,
I got to get you somewhere safe,

369
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,935
before Homelander finds out.

370
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,227
I love you.

371
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,200
I love you, too.

372
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:39,015
Mani? Pedi? Special deal.

373
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,821
The hilarious
Dolphins Ahoy Extravaganza,

374
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,452
starring these two knuckleheads.

375
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,539
So this fall, remember, go Deep.
Go Oceanland.

376
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:57,117
All right, let's see
what you got.

377
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,847
You said you, uh,
you bowled before?

378
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,468
Yeah, I'm just a little rusty.

379
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,805
- You?
- Uh, yeah. Here, actually.

380
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,482
My whole life.

381
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,150
I had my first kiss
with Amy Seeler

382
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,859
in the men's bathroom
when I was 14.

383
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,859
- It was really romantic.
- Yeah.

384
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,912
I'm sure that's exactly how
she pictured her first kiss.

385
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,817
Excuse me.
Where was your first kiss?

386
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,815
Prom.

387
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,576
It was amazing.

388
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,749
Wait, senior prom?

389
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,749
So your first kiss
was when you were 18?

390
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,581
Mm-hmm.

391
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,206
Which you're not joking about,

392
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,213
and that's fine, that's great.

393
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:50,255
Yeah, I had a very
Jesus-centric childhood.

394
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,265
Yeah!

395
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,096
He never asked me out again.

396
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,904
Sorry. Um, what were you saying?

397
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,819
No, just about prom.

398
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,238
- What was it... what about...
- Nothing.

399
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,568
It's-it's stupid.

400
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:16,202
Um, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna throw one.

401
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:21,576
Ah! Ah.

402
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,962
So what's, uh,
what's Translucent like?

403
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,380
That's a conversational
left turn.

404
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,130
Yes, it was.
I'm sorry about that.

405
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,801
Sorry. Yeah, it just
popped into my head.

406
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,550
As a kid, he was my favorite.

407
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,301
You said the other ones
were dicks; is he a dick, too?

408
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:40,224
Well, I mean, he's not great
with privacy or boundaries,

409
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,266
I will say that.

410
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,060
But otherwise,
he seems like a loner.

411
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,524
He spends most of his free time
with his son.

412
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,987
- He's got a son?
- Yeah. Early divorce, I think.

413
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,910
He's about ten.

414
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,868
Hunter or Maverick
or something like that.

415
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,478
It's okay.

416
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,138
All right, everyone,
it's all over.

417
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:11,516
It's all safe.
You're all gonna be fine.

418
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,992
Thank you, Homelander!

419
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,657
Oh, no, no.

420
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,197
Come on, now. You guys.

421
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,202
You guys made it.

422
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,084
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

423
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,291
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

424
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,290
Good for you.

425
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,631
You guys are amazing, fantastic.

426
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,667
Go, Maeve!

427
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,249
Hey, let's get
a round of applause

428
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,634
for Queen Maeve.

429
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,881
Yeah!

430
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,140
Captain?

431
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,137
Stop. Stop.

432
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,036
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, easy, fella.

433
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,600
Take it easy.

434
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,726
There you go, just relax.

435
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,785
ATC!

436
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,499
It's dead!

437
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,129
Can you fly a plane?

438
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,167
Wouldn't matter if I did!

439
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,625
What do we do?

440
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,398
All right, everyone,
remain calm.

441
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,858
Stay in your seats.
Everything's under control.

442
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,740
You got to go out there,
lift the plane up.

443
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,907
Lift the plane? How?
There's nothing to stand on.

444
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,117
It's fucking air.

445
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,907
I don't know, fly at it,
ram it straight.

446
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,040
No, that kind of speed, either
the plane goes ass over tit

447
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,039
or I'll punch straight
through the hull, or...

448
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,917
Whoa! Whoa, that was a big one!

449
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,633
Everything's fine,
don't worry about it.

450
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,563
Okay. Okay.

451
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:09,227
You take everybody, one by one,
you fly them to the ground.

452
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:13,056
And what?
Come back 123 times?

453
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,113
Maeve, think.

454
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,355
We're done here.

455
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,452
- Please.
- Everything's fine, guys.

456
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,829
- Everything's fine. You're okay.
- Wait, you're leaving us?

457
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,247
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just
seeing something down the back.

458
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,456
Oh, my God, you're leaving.

459
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,208
- He's leaving us.
- I said I'm not...

460
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,920
Whoa!

461
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,961
Homelander,
are you going to save us?

462
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,924
Oh, sweetheart, of course
I'm gonna save you,

463
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,586
you betcha.

464
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,684
I'm gonna save everyone here,
don't worry about it.

465
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,469
- Ma'am, relax, hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

466
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,022
Maeve!

467
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:19,377
Okay, you two,
take off your masks. Come on.

468
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,170
Now!

469
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,339
- Take these two!
- No, no.

470
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,947
- Just these two! Please!
- No! What, so they

471
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,431
can tell the world that we left

472
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,892
the rest of them to fucking die?

473
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,022
- Come on!
- No, Maeve. No. You stay back!

474
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,350
All of you, stay back.

475
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,266
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you, goddamn it!

476
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,526
I will laser every
fucking one of you!

477
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,898
Stay back!

478
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,905
Let's go.

479
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,987
No, Maeve, no!

480
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,914
- Please stay!
- I'm sorry.

481
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,082
- Take us!
- Maeve!

482
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,660
Please, don't leave us. Please!

483
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,496
Maeve!

484
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,541
Don't die with them.

485
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,376
Maeve.

486
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,631
- What is wrong with you?
- Please, Maeve!

487
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,893
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

488
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,676
Please take her.

489
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,060
Take my daughter!

490
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,850
- Please! Please take her!
- Please.

491
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,694
Take her!

492
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,343
Oh, look at this.

493
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,505
- Homicide.
- You got here fast.

494
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,524
- Yeah, it was on the squawker.
- What's with the accent?

495
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,977
What's with yours?

496
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:00,147
You ever seen her here before?

497
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,017
Maybe a year ago.

498
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,073
It's a gang hit.

499
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,783
A gang hit?

500
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:16,575
- And who told you that, eh?
- I'm not arguing with him.

501
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,750
I'm looking into it.

502
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,672
Excuse me.

503
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,674
Cheers, mate.

504
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,444
A-Train saw me
a fucking week ago.

505
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,954
- What if he made me?
- He didn't see you.

506
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,528
Listen, that's easy for you to
say, Butcher, but I got people.

507
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,704
Oh? And I don't?

508
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:02,209
Look, Vought don't send a Supe
to do a gang hit, all right?

509
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,789
He was after the female.

510
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,424
Hey, man, who was the woman?

511
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,172
Roberta Cho, mother of four,

512
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,723
loved Mexican food, and smuggled
in a ton of immigrants

513
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,849
- from all over the Pacific.
- Eh, like our girl.

514
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,257
A-Train, can I get a selfie?

515
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,853
I got it.

516
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:24,312
That wanker can cover
all of Manhattan in 30 minutes.

517
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,324
He's gonna find her
before we do.

518
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,436
No, he won't.
I know where she's going.

519
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,985
Penn Station.

520
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,199
She's working her way backwards.
She's trying to get home.

521
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:43,536
I'm Ezekiel, and I want you
to join me at the BELIEVE EXPO,

522
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,752
June 6 to 10
at the Fairgrounds.

523
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,713
Sponsored
by Samaritan's Embrace.

524
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,343
We're gonna have music,

525
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,049
we're gonna have worship,
food trucks and,

526
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,640
oh, yeah, Christ.

527
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:59,347
Featuring Homelander
and Starlight from The Seven.

528
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,309
- Hey.
- I know.

529
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,770
Look, I'm not down to convert
the masses or anything,

530
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,691
I'm just...
I'm doing a panel for teens.

531
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,270
And, uh, I'm donating
my appearance fee

532
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,896
to the Covenant House.

533
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,533
You are literally
the nicest person in the city.

534
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,240
No, seriously.

535
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,781
Every other nice person
can fuck off and go home.

536
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,156
I mean, that's why I do it.

537
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:25,173
Vindictive personal glory.

538
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,843
You okay?

539
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,169
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

540
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,388
You seem a little...

541
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,269
I don't know.

542
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,658
Hmm.

543
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,459
Okay.

544
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,594
I'll come clean.

545
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:13,006
If I'm being honest...

546
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,586
I'm a little suspicious of you.

547
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,881
You are?

548
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,255
Yeah. I mean,
you say you bowled a lot.

549
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,774
And you know, you have,
like, superpowers,

550
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,477
yet you are
a remarkably shitty bowler.

551
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,605
You know what
I think is happening?

552
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,357
I think you're holding back
for some weird,

553
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,030
"not gonna show me up
on a first date" reason.

554
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,281
You want to quit stroking my ego
and show me what you really got?

555
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,253
Holy shit.

556
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,509
Now that's a strike.

557
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,220
Yeah.

558
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,470
Yeah, that's great, man.

559
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,314
Good looking out. Thanks.

560
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,310
Well? Don't leave us hanging.

561
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,732
Okay, so Deshawn's a brother
that grew up on my block,

562
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,151
but now he delivers packages.

563
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,689
Yeah, not the part
I'm interested in.

564
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,572
He ran down the account number

565
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,529
and the box containing the V
came from Samaritan's Embrace.

566
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,240
Ezekiel's Supe charity?

567
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,820
What the fuck's
that Jesus-thumping,

568
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,076
elastic bastard
got to do with it?

569
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,118
Maybe we find the girl,
we find out.

570
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,123
Yeah. All right.

571
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,085
Platforms, ground floor,
I'll take upstairs.

572
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,021
Whoever pings her, get onto
Frenchie and stick with her

573
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,285
till we use the gas, all right?

574
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,769
If you're just tuning in,

575
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,481
authorities have lost
all radar and satellite imagery

576
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:57,482
of hijacked Flight 37
and fear the worst.

577
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,436
Search planes have begun
to fan out

578
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,276
over the flight path
off the Atlantic...

579
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,845
Non, non.

580
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:14,194
It's okay. It's gone.

581
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,767
It's gone, you see?

582
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,734
I'm not here to hurt you.

583
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,580
You like music, huh?

584
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,326
Well, me, too.

585
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:38,384
C-Can I tell you a secret
I never told anyone?

586
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,296
When I was a boy,

587
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,603
my father, he stole me
from Mamma.

588
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:53,227
In Marseilles, middle of the
night, just broke in, took me.

589
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,226
Kept me with him for years.

590
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,268
Hotel after hotel.

591
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:01,652
Every few nights,
take me out for a walk.

592
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:06,201
Smoke a Gauloise,
tell me he loved me, then...

593
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,714
I tried to run away
so many times.

594
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:23,133
I jumped buses, trains.

595
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,591
Anything to get back
to Marseilles.

596
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:30,103
To Mamma.

597
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,967
But every time, he find me.

598
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,440
So I know what it's like
to want to go home.

599
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:50,122
You see, I know your secret.

600
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,155
You're not a bad person.

601
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,754
Just a scared one.

602
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,383
Let me help you.

603
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,459
...reports of suspicious activity...

604
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,686
Coming through.

605
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,616
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...

606
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,410
Frenchie. Did you see her?
Which way did she go?

607
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,849
- I don't know.
- Did you try to gas her?

608
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,173
- No.
- Why not?

609
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,977
- It didn't seem right, huh?
- You went off plan

610
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,921
- because it didn't seem right?
- I'm sorry, okay?

611
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,838
Ah, Sean Jakowski.
Cross-country team.

612
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:56,176
- Mm.
- I had such a huge crush on him,

613
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,563
and he finally asked me out
to this party.

614
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,730
My hair looked cute,
we held hands, it was perfect.

615
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,400
Then, all of a sudden,
this senior shoved Sean,

616
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,819
and then he hit him.

617
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,857
So I stepped in,
I kicked the guy's ass.

618
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,702
- Good for you.
- Mm.

619
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,407
Want to know
how Sean thanked me?

620
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,487
- How?
- Never spoke to me again.

621
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,492
Not one word.

622
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,084
And that's when I learned,

623
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,170
never show your strength
to a boy you like.

624
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,376
Well, to be honest,

625
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,128
Sean Jakowski had
a tiny little baby dick.

626
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,304
It doesn't bother you that I
could whip your ass in bowling?

627
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,716
And in everything?

628
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,266
And bench-press you?

629
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,439
Oh, my God, is that
a threat or a promise?

630
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:47,318
- Hmm.
- And no. No. I-I...

631
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:52,357
I really think it's awesome,
the real you.

632
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,410
Um, you got... ketchup.

633
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,662
Mm? Oh.

634
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:04,075
What? You don't like that?

635
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:06,084
Doesn't work for you?

636
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,221
Save my spot.
I'll be right back.

637
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

638
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:01,139
So where's the girl, Frenchie?

639
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,391
Since you're the psycho chick
whisperer all of a sudden.

640
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,393
Maybe subway. Maybe she wants
to find a train, no?

641
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,122
Oh, yeah? How deep up your ass
did you pull that out?

642
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,665
Well, it depends.
How deep does your tongue go?

643
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,289
Listen, you lost her, man.

644
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,960
We had orders,
we're supposed to follow them.

645
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,944
We're professionals
and we count on each other.

646
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,486
But you're on some fucking
bohemian flaky drug shit.

647
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,491
Even Hughie,
who's a fucking white Urkel,

648
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,303
- is more professional than you.
- I understand it's hard

649
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,287
for someone who's anally OCD
to understand.

650
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,079
Okay, then help me
understand, Frenchie.

651
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,600
What happened the night
that Mallory had you

652
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,143
- tail Lamplighter?
- Oh, that's enough.

653
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,457
Mallory was our boss, man.
We had orders.

654
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,094
And you were supposed
to follow him.

655
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,649
You were supposed
to follow Lamplighter,

656
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,473
- tail him, but you let him go.
- I didn't know.

657
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,970
And Lamplighter goes
and torches Mallory's grandkids.

658
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,012
- I didn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

659
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:46,556
You didn't follow orders
and it costs some lives.

660
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,476
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

661
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,902
- Knock it off.
- You know what?

662
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,821
Fuck this, Butcher.

663
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,359
And fuck you. I'm done!

664
00:44:57,404 --> 00:45:00,824
- Stupid fucker...
- M.M., wait.

665
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,785
You said this time
would be different.

666
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:07,247
But this motherfucker's still
here doing the same old shit.

667
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,708
And we're all gonna
fucking end up like Mallory.

668
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,090
- Yeah, fuck off. Come on.
- Fuck this.

669
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,708
Oi, both of you.

670
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,974
- M.M.
- What?

671
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:20,216
What's Sporty Spice up to?

672
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,180
Who?

673
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,510
Sporty fucking Spice.
What is she up to?

674
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,389
I don't know.

675
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:32,016
Exactly. How about Posh?

676
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,193
- You know what she's doing?
- I don't understand.

677
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,732
Making clothes
for anorexics. Right?

678
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,526
Not exactly a growth market.

679
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,740
And Baby?
You know what she's doing?

680
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:45,451
Fuck all. Not even page six
of the Daily Mail.

681
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,873
And Scary Spice?

682
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,962
Up to her eyeballs
in lawsuits and sex tapes.

683
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:54,039
Ginger, on the other hand,
has released three albums.

684
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:58,465
Passion, Schizophonic and
Scream If You Wanna Go Faster.

685
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:02,046
They'll all make
your ears bleed.

686
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,553
You see, when they're apart,

687
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,556
they're absolute
fucking rubbish.

688
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:11,688
But, you put them together,

689
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:15,728
they're the goddamn
fucking Spice Girls.

690
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,741
How do you know so much
about the Spice Girls?

691
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,290
Look, the point is,

692
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,407
that we're all shite
by ourselves.

693
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,286
We need each other.

694
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,883
We need each other, or we're
fucking dead in the water.

695
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,550
Now, you guys can beat
the living fucking shit

696
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:41,549
out of each other,
I really don't care,

697
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:44,051
it ain't gonna change the past.

698
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:53,806
What do you say we go find
that dirty little bitch,

699
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:57,403
gas her ass,
then get the fuck out of here?

700
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,405
Jesus, he gives
the worst pep talks.

701
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,117
He really, really does.

702
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,788
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

703
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,633
That's right.

704
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,209
Next stop, the Atlantic Ocean.

705
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,844
That's right. That's right.

706
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,005
What?

707
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:30,012
Okay. Okay, yeah.

708
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,306
I mean, let's just focus on the
escape first and, uh, you know,

709
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,481
we can talk about that
some other time.

710
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,610
Well, uh, I like you, too.

711
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,279
You know that.

712
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,607
But let's not, you know,
rush into anything too fast.

713
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,950
All right, seriously,
now is not the appropriate time.

714
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,703
Plus, you're making things awkward.

715
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,705
Okay, okay!

716
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,708
If I just touch it,
will you shut up?

717
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,798
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

718
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,550
I made you a promise.

719
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,259
Hey.

720
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,096
Shit...

721
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,318
- Let's go.
- No, Frenchie.

722
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,978
Forget it, mate. She's fucked.

723
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,703
A-Train!

724
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,029
Over here! Look, everybody!

725
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,469
- It's A-Train right over here!
- A-Train's here?

726
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,993
- No way.
- Look, it's A-Train!

727
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,076
Hey.

728
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,004
Cool, look who's here.

729
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,592
Shit, what's up, A-Train?

730
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:07,839
A-Train, hey.

731
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,300
Hey, can we take a selfie?

732
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,220
Oh, sure, absolutely.

733
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,009
I can take one or two.

734
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,012
A-Train, over here.

735
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:43,081
No. Let me talk to her.

736
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,924
Don't be fucking stupid.

737
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:50,343
What if she's a Spice Girl?

738
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,841
Frenchie.

739
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,824
Let me help you go home.

740
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,863
She ain't no Spice Girl.

741
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,316
Once again,
the horrific wreckage

742
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,446
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37

743
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,503
just beginning to wash up
on shore.

744
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,667
Every passenger on board
presumed dead.

745
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,917
They didn't have to die.

746
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:56,126
We have Homelander
and Queen Maeve on the scene.

747
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,143
Do you have a comment?

748
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,846
I said they didn't have to die.

749
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:05,518
We arrived three minutes
after the plane went down.

750
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:08,228
And why?

751
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,809
Because we're not
in the chain of command.

752
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:14,935
If NORAD called us
before they scrambled jets,

753
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,784
then we could've saved them.

754
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:20,779
123 men, women and children.

755
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,833
Excuse me.

756
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:31,788
But if they let us
into the military,

757
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,804
then this will
never happen again.

758
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:38,377
That is my solemn promise
to you.

759
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,434
Right, Maeve?

760
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,930
Talk to your congressmen.

761
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,722
Talk to them.
They'll listen to the people.

762
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:49,226
And together,

763
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:52,438
together, we will make sure
that this never happens

764
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,480
to our great nation ever again!

765
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,856
God bless you.

766
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,065
God bless America.

767
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,927
We hear you, Homelander!

768
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:08,121
And I hear you, brother!
I hear you!

769
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:11,122
And the world hears you!

770
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,035
And very, very soon, my friend,

771
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:18,586
whoever did this to us
will hear from all of us!

772
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,931
Homelander!

773
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:24,097
Homelander! Homelander!

774
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:28,516
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

775
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,977
Homelander! Homelander!

776
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:36,649
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

777
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,571
Homelander! Homelander!

778
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,570
Homelander!
