1
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:33,421
Christ almighty.

2
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,216
What the hell happened here?

3
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,509
Please.

4
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,304
They need medical attention.
Please. Please.

5
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:42,472
Thompson, help them.

6
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,308
Got it.

7
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:50,105
Daniel, look at me.

8
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:56,612
Jesus Christ.

9
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:10,042
Don't let any of 'em out your sight, okay?

10
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,210
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:15,172
Okay, guys, come over here.
Um, I wanna make sure we cordon off...

12
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:20,844
<i>- ETA on the ambulances.
- They're two out, sir.</i>

13
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:25,849
I need five of 'em to...
54 St. Mark's, right away.

14
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,188
Mahoney.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,744
Let me guess.
You're the one who found 'em.

16
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:49,622
The cages, the medical tubing.
They were being drained.

17
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:51,416
- For what?
- Doesn't matter.

18
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,460
We need to find the people
who did this to them.

19
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:56,254
It would be a good start
if you told me who that was.

20
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:58,590
You see anyone down there?

21
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:02,427
No.

22
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:07,057
But you could start with the Yakuza.

23
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,434
- "Start with"?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:11,019
Shit!

25
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:13,646
You saying the Yakuza
is mixed up with another group?

26
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:15,899
I think so.

27
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:19,111
That's scarier than all this
cult-looking ritual shit put together.

28
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:23,782
This group... they got a name?

29
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,868
- I'm working on it.
- Yeah, I'll bet you are.

30
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,495
Listen, these victims, they need
to be taken somewhere off the grid,

31
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:29,778
somewhere they can't be found.

32
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:31,581
No. What they need
is medical attention.

33
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:33,291
I know, and they'll get it, but...

34
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,415
Whatever was being done to them,
it may not be over.

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,045
We need to get them somewhere safe.

36
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,006
Yeah, that might not be a bad idea.

37
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,340
All Saints is closest...

38
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:42,092
No, take them to Metro-General.

39
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,302
I know someone there we can trust. But...

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,264
no one can know you're bringing them in.

41
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:48,598
I'm on it.

42
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:51,810
And just know, someday...

43
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:53,603
I'ma tell you how to do your job.

44
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,538
Thompson, I need a favor.

45
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,917
Got the last one.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,502
And he's burning up.
I need a cooling blanket and ice packs.

47
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,296
We're out.

48
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,131
Jesus. Uh...

49
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,300
Vending machine.

50
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,636
Next floor down.
Get all the cold sodas you can.

51
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,079
- Okay.
- Apply them on their wrists.

52
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:29,389
We need to get the fever down.

53
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:30,808
Thanks for this.

54
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,309
Thank administration.

55
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,644
They've taken six months
to remodel this wing.

56
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,188
Anything happens, you let me know.

57
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:38,398
I'll keep a few PD here,
and more downstairs.

58
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,067
- Okay.
- And do me a favor?

59
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,111
Keep the details
of this arrangement to yourself.

60
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:45,030
Details?

61
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:46,489
Our mutual friend.

62
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,576
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

63
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:53,455
This ain't like any overdose
I've ever seen.

64
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:55,415
Yeah, their systems are in free fall.

65
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,336
- Holy shit.
- What?

66
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,628
She's got no prints.

67
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,342
Her fingertips were burnt off.

68
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:08,971
Her, too.

69
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:10,680
IDing 'em is gonna be fun.

70
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,390
What kind of junkies do this?

71
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:14,601
Yeah, I think this was done to them.

72
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:18,271
Let's just get them stable.
One headache at a time.

73
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:29,241
You.

74
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:31,243
And here I was hoping
my day would get worse.

75
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:34,121
- Hi, Claire.
- Five patients, non-responsive,

76
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:36,957
high fever, no fingerprints.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,292
You wanna tell me what kind of shit storm
you just rained down on me?

78
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,752
It's why I'm here.

79
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,758
In here.

80
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,430
What's the story?

81
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:53,556
It's, um...

82
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:56,309
it's complicated.

83
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,436
Always is with you.

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,688
Remember the last time you patched me up?

85
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:02,690
When you were cut to shreds?

86
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:06,611
Kinda hard to forget.

87
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:08,446
Well, the same guy who did that to me,

88
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,116
he's the one responsible
for your five new patients.

89
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:13,326
Nobu.

90
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:15,871
You said he burned to death.

91
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:17,080
Yeah.

92
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,333
I was wrong.

93
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,048
There's gotta be more
to the story than that.

94
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:29,342
For now...

95
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:32,095
I need you to know that every one
of these people is still in real danger.

96
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,557
Okay, I have checked their vitals.
I know, they're hanging by a thread.

97
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,977
No. Claire, I mean...
even if you manage to save their lives,

98
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,146
someone may still come to kill them.

99
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,231
And the people who gave them aid?

100
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:44,857
Most likely.

101
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:46,901
Yes.

102
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,946
Wow, Matt. I...

103
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,698
I really have not missed you at all.

104
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:54,909
But, look, Claire,
nobody knows they're here.

105
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:57,454
And I'm gonna offer you
all the protection I can.

106
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,498
Plus, you can still send them away.

107
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,961
You know I can't do that.

108
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,171
Thank you.

109
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:07,547
It's why I came to you.

110
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,926
Are you hurt?

111
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:15,263
Yeah...

112
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:16,431
a little.

113
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:17,890
"A little"?

114
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,855
Oh.

115
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:25,565
That's...

116
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:26,816
Bone bruise.

117
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,152
A fractured rib, most likely.

118
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:31,446
It's probably busted, knowing you.

119
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:35,993
I'll say this about you,
Matt Murdock.

120
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:38,120
You are a lot of bad things.

121
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:40,288
Boring is not one of them.

122
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:43,000
Here.

123
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,502
- What is it?
- Two aspirin.

124
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:47,212
Catholic morphine. Take it.

125
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,546
I don't know.

126
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,884
I'm...

127
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,969
<i>All units, suspect Frank Castle.</i>

128
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:57,097
<i>Believed to be
armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

129
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,058
<i>I should've known
this day would get worse.</i>

130
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:02,560
<i>I want this out across all five boroughs.</i>

131
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:05,397
<i>And get some additional units
to the courthouse and City Hall.</i>

132
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,065
<i>- Do it. Move!
- Son of a bitch.</i>

133
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:08,191
What is it?

134
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,652
The Punisher.

135
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,321
He just escaped.

136
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,685
- Miss Page?
- Yeah.

137
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,104
Agent Gallagher. Follow me.

138
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,771
I'll get you through security
as quickly as possible.

139
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,065
Thank you.

140
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,153
Excuse us.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

141
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:36,321
Sorry.

142
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:38,781
Wait here.

143
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,367
Hey.

144
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,285
Guess I'm not the only one
that got Reyes's invitation.

145
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,787
Security is nuts.

146
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:47,249
Frank Castle's on the loose.
I wouldn't take any chances either.

147
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,792
No, not even Frank could have
orchestrated an escape that quickly.

148
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:52,044
How's that even possible?

149
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:56,466
Guessing that's what the District Attorney
wants to ask us.

150
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,676
This case just keeps serving up
the shit burgers.

151
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,221
- Mr. Nelson, this way.
- See you on the other side.

152
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:02,430
Yeah.

153
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:09,354
Excuse me, sir.
Do you need a hand?

154
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:11,398
No, thank you.
Thank you so much.

155
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,790
I, uh, see Reyes... dragged you in, too.

156
00:09:28,873 --> 00:09:30,041
Karen?

157
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,545
Are you all right?

158
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:36,756
Other than being hauled in as a suspect
in the escape of a confessed murderer?

159
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:38,800
Yeah, I'm great.

160
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,554
Yeah, this whole case
has been a disaster.

161
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,182
I'm sorry I pulled you guys into it.

162
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:47,434
Don't be sorry.

163
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,439
How are you otherwise?

164
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,899
Good. Yeah, I'm good.

165
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,404
Good.

166
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:00,738
Miss Page?

167
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,073
- Come with me.
- Yeah.

168
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:03,741
Mr. Murdock, I'll be right back.

169
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,704
<i>According to my buddy,</i>

170
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,581
Reyes is most likely
about to grill us like fish.

171
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:10,957
She has no cause.

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,917
On paper,
we're still Frank Castle's attorneys.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,086
And I am so proud of that.

174
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,339
Frank's out, but instead of
going after him herself,

175
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,591
Reyes is dragging us
into the lion's den.

176
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,510
What could we possibly
know about his escape?

177
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:24,262
Precisely dick.

178
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,889
But if Reyes can find a way
to blame us for all this, she will.

179
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,850
Karen, you spent
the most time with him.

180
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,227
He say anything?

181
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,894
Anything at all
that could help us right now?

182
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:34,231
Nothing about an escape.

183
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:36,441
I went over Castle's transfer work.

184
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,653
He wasn't waltzing into some country club.

185
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:44,031
They were burying him
in their highest security control unit...

186
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:46,326
with all the other rock stars
on cell block D.

187
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,085
Uh, Matt... this way.

188
00:10:57,712 --> 00:11:00,382
Hey, Foggy.
You said cell block D?

189
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,759
- It'll be just another minute.
- Thanks.

190
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:04,135
Does that mean something to you?

191
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:07,347
Yeah, I like to keep track of the people
who might want to kill us.

192
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,016
- The Punisher?
- No, not Frank. Wilson Fisk.

193
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:13,102
Frank blows his trial,
and ends up on Fisk's cell block?

194
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:15,313
And a day later, he's on the street.

195
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,106
Uh, those are two very separate dots.

196
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,858
- You can't just connect them.
- Oh, come on, Foggy.

197
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,193
I'm right.
Fisk made this happen.

198
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:25,615
She'll see you now.

199
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,118
Ma'am?

200
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:31,329
They're here now.

201
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:34,832
Yes. As soon as possible.
Please, as soon as possible.

202
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,336
Thank you for coming.

203
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,427
Kinda hard to say no
when the cops pick you up.

204
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,800
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Could you, uh...

205
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,635
Please, have a seat.

206
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,347
Please.

207
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:52,517
The second chair.

208
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,464
I don't know what your play is, lady,
but let's cut the shit.

209
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:02,465
You brought us in expecting to sweat

210
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,946
privileged information
about our client out of us.

211
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,326
Yes... if that helps.

212
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:12,495
We have to get Frank Castle off the street
before anyone else gets hurt.

213
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,372
You're asking for favors,
after all the shit you've pulled?

214
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,791
If you want our cooperation,

215
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,918
then we need to know
what you know... all right?

216
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,295
All of your cards on the table, right now.

217
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:25,508
I've made mistakes.

218
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:28,428
Excuse me?

219
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,762
Central Park.

220
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,516
Castle and his family.
I screwed up.

221
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,102
Frank Castle's family
being gunned down

222
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:37,395
is not a mistake, it's a massacre.

223
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,022
Wait. I swear to God, if I had any idea
that people might get hurt,

224
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,441
- I would not have done that.
- You...

225
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:43,234
Your office were part of it?

226
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:44,777
Why am I not surprised?

227
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,654
They were more
than just part of it.

228
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:47,905
It was a sting.

229
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,491
How do you know that?

230
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:52,619
I've gotten really good at digging up shit
people like you wanna keep buried.

231
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:53,786
Hey, Karen. Just...

232
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,997
- Probably not a good idea.
- Trust me.

233
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,583
Ma'am... they need to know.

234
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:10,094
Last year, the DA's office learned
there was a new player in the drug trade.

235
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,929
Calls himself the Blacksmith.

236
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:14,724
He wasn't gonna flood the market,
he was gonna be the market.

237
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,935
And we were tracking kilos,
but this guy dealt in metric tons.

238
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,981
Volume like that should have made him
easy to find, but he was a ghost.

239
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:24,384
No sign of how he was getting
the product into the country,

240
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,986
where it was coming from, nothing.

241
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:31,073
Then one of the cops we planted
deep undercover got word

242
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:34,661
that the Blacksmith was arranging
a meet between three unaffiliated gangs.

243
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:37,329
Dogs of Hell, Kitchen Irish,
and the Mexican Cartel.

244
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,373
Blacksmith wanted to broker a deal.

245
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:42,043
They set the meet for Central Park,
midafternoon.

246
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,796
Look, our guys were there.
They were ready.

247
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,839
But the sting, it just, it...
it went south.

248
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:48,675
You didn't clear the park, did you?

249
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,928
I thought about it.

250
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,431
But I decided an empty park
could show our hand.

251
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:56,433
So, yes...

252
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,935
I greenlit the operation...

253
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:01,479
civilian traffic and all.

254
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,524
And it, oh-so-predictably,
all went to shit.

255
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,986
Blacksmith didn't show.

256
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:12,198
Before we had a chance to move in...

257
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,910
the gangs got rattled
and opened fire on each other.

258
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:19,539
Our undercover was killed
and Castle's family...

259
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:20,873
God damn it.

260
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:24,794
So after that horrible decision,
you made it worse.

261
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:27,922
You tried to kill him and ruin us
to save your own political ass.

262
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,424
You know what, lady,
you're on your own.

263
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:34,011
Wait, wait.
This is not about me anymore.

264
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:37,765
I found this in my daughter's backpack
before sending her off to school.

265
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,142
X-ray of a skull.

266
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:41,769
Castle.

267
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:44,271
You know once he gets his sights
set on a target, he never stops...

268
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:45,955
- Where's your daughter now?
- Upstate...

269
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:48,222
New York somewhere,
in a location I can never know about,

270
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:52,113
surrounded by men with guns...
assigned to protect her.

271
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,907
My baby girl.

272
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:59,078
Ms. Reyes, it's highly unlikely
Frank Castle would target your family.

273
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:02,373
I... This is hard to understand,
but he has his own internal code...

274
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:05,001
I'm sorry,
am I supposed to trust that?

275
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,881
I don't care how much time you spent
in an interrogation room with him.

276
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:12,216
He's coming after my child.

277
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,468
What do you want from us?

278
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,219
If he contacts you,
just let us know.

279
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:16,888
You want us to break privilege?

280
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,265
I wanna make sure that
nobody else gets hurt.

281
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:20,767
Look, I...

282
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:23,227
I know what I've done here.

283
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,647
But please.

284
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,900
I don't give a shit about my job anymore.

285
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:31,528
I just wanna keep my family safe.

286
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:33,571
Get down!

287
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:18,300
How you feel?

288
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,345
Like I've been shot.

289
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:23,723
He says I'll be fine, though.

290
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:27,935
Right.

291
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,103
Matt, don't.

292
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:36,736
- I have to find him, Foggy.
- Good idea.

293
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,487
Strike now, while the police
have his whereabouts

294
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,072
narrowed down to
the island of Manhattan.

295
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,533
- I know where to start.
- You always know where to start.

296
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:44,368
You just never know when to stop, Matt.

297
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:47,204
I'm not asking for your permission.
All right? I'll see ya.

298
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,875
Sorry.

299
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,130
Hey. Where's Matt going?

300
00:17:57,548 --> 00:17:58,758
Why ask me?

301
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:13,648
I spent nights looking
at Frank Castle's crime scenes.

302
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,775
They look so different from the inside.

303
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:17,985
You knew about Reyes and the cover-up
the whole time.

304
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,821
I suspected.

305
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:24,200
But the cover-up was well underway
before I started at the DA's office.

306
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,119
But you don't get it.

307
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,205
If it came out that civilians
were killed on her watch...

308
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,833
a war hero, no less...
her career would have been over.

309
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,625
Tower, she's dead now.

310
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:39,757
I can't...

311
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,635
Uh...

312
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:48,474
She was altering medical records,
police reports.

313
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:52,311
Getting sloppier every time.

314
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:55,732
She was covering her tracks,
but the trail just kept spreading wider.

315
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,359
And when I caught wind of it,
my hands were tied.

316
00:18:58,442 --> 00:18:59,682
It was... it was just too late.

317
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,363
But I couldn't let myself
go down with her.

318
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:04,073
So you slipped Karen the X-ray.

319
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,451
Reyes ordered the DNR on Castle?

320
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:09,245
His family was gone.

321
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,873
Castle was hanging by a thread.
She just wanted the problem to go away.

322
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,415
Well, it didn't.

323
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:15,042
Castle didn't die.

324
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,838
The man just murdered...

325
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:24,010
a New York District Attorney,
and anyone who crossed him could be next.

326
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,472
I'm sorry... I'm sorry for your loss.

327
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,851
I'm gonna get the hell
out of town for a while.

328
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,729
If I were you, I'd do the same.

329
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:42,236
How bad is it?

330
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,655
They're gonna take some X-rays,
just in case.

331
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,200
- I'll come.
- No, that's okay.

332
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:50,619
Really, I'm good alone.
I don't need you.

333
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:54,540
Do me a favor. Watch your back.

334
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:12,474
I'll need you to sign an affidavit...

335
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,977
agreeing to our terms,
before you can see my client.

336
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:16,395
Of course.

337
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,565
It's in braille.

338
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:24,111
Mr. Fisk requested that I accommodate
your... particular disability.

339
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:27,448
He's a very thoughtful man.

340
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:33,537
You will not come into
physical contact with Mr. Fisk.

341
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,706
You will not discuss
your conversation with Mr. Fisk

342
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,877
with any media outlet, government entity,
law enforcement agency,

343
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,004
or outside party of any kind.

344
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:46,050
Failure to do so will result in severe
financial penalties, detailed there.

345
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:50,847
You will refer to Mr. Fisk
only as "Mr. Fisk,"

346
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,059
and he will not answer any questions
until I personally approve of them first.

347
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,519
That's a lot of rules.

348
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,815
Rules are what separate us
from the animals, Mr. Murdock.

349
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,568
Thank you.

350
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,531
Excellent.

351
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:18,207
Straight ahead.

352
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,191
On the left, sir.

353
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,328
Mind the cane.

354
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,357
You have ten minutes, Mr. Murdock.

355
00:22:32,823 --> 00:22:35,909
We met once before, you and I.

356
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:38,204
Before you went after me in court.

357
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:41,248
Do you remember?

358
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,835
It was at an art gallery,
several months ago.

359
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:47,629
I assume you've heard there's been
a shooting at the courthouse?

360
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,174
Unfortunate news.

361
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,094
But why does that send you to me?

362
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:56,555
Because I know you facilitated
Frank Castle's escape.

363
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:00,392
Why would I do that?

364
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:04,646
Frank Castle's path and mine
are so clearly separate.

365
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,065
Lack of motive.

366
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:11,988
Enough to throw any rational
law enforcement agency way off your trail.

367
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:14,656
But I'm not biting.

368
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,949
Not biting.

369
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:19,161
He's not biting, Donovan.
Barking!

370
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,288
It's what you do.

371
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:23,207
The scheming, the machinations.

372
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,003
Frank Castle is a killing machine,
and you set him free.

373
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:29,505
Which means you're aiming
a loose cannon at someone,

374
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:30,756
and we both know it.

375
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,591
And you can prove that in a court of law?

376
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:33,842
Where is Frank Castle?

377
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:35,219
Not here.

378
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,017
Did you have anything
to do with his release?

379
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,184
You don't have to answer that.

380
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:43,769
No, I didn't.

381
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,522
Clock's ticking, Mr. Murdock.

382
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,985
These days are hectic in Hell's Kitchen.

383
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,322
Lunatic shooters, gang wars.

384
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:01,245
I understand you're frantic,
you're looking for answers.

385
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:02,788
I have none.

386
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,711
Sometimes I'm glad I'm... in here.

387
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,965
The fate of New York City
is out of my hands for once.

388
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,593
That's bullshit!

389
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,603
I don't know what you expect from me...

390
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,607
but we're finished here.

391
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:34,736
Mr. Donovan.

392
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:41,452
Vanessa.

393
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,791
You asked me if I remember
the art gallery. I do.

394
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:51,170
I remember her very well.

395
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:53,255
Hmm.

396
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:58,635
She's out of the country.
She, uh... wants to come back.

397
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:01,805
Leave us.

398
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:13,692
So listen to me very closely.

399
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:14,776
Hmm.

400
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,030
I will use every legal
loophole and footnote...

401
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:22,075
to make certain that never happens.

402
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:28,165
You see, unlike your
other adversaries, Mr. Fisk...

403
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,502
I can break you without
breaking a single law.

404
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:34,796
You may have expensive lawyers,

405
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,092
but with one envelope and $6 postage...

406
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:43,680
I can make sure Vanessa never
sets foot on American soil again.

407
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:47,393
One letter to the right office...

408
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:49,520
and I get her visa pulled.

409
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:55,151
I can prove she was an accomplice
to every one of your crimes.

410
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:04,117
And now you're thinking
you can serve your sentence,

411
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,620
hop on a jet, go to her whenever you like.

412
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:11,583
Live somewhere like Monaco, or...

413
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:15,086
I don't know, wherever the hell
you fat cats go to sun yourselves.

414
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:16,672
But you can't.

415
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,093
You can visit her,
but you'll never live with her.

416
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:26,182
Because this is New York, Wilson.
You live here.

417
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:30,060
This is your jungle.
This is your blood, like it is mine.

418
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:35,232
She will never come...

419
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:36,942
and you'll never leave.

420
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:40,487
You screw with me now,
just a little bit...

421
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:44,616
and you'll never really be with your
one and only Vanessa ever again.

422
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,458
Speak her name again!
Go ahead!

423
00:26:56,545 --> 00:26:58,547
Yes, the son of a boxer.

424
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:01,007
You...

425
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:02,759
You are running this place.

426
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:04,261
Yeah, you did set him free.

427
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:06,763
You ask such small questions,
Mr. Murdock.

428
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:09,308
I know you're regaining power in here.

429
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:11,935
Yes, ask my lawyer. He'll deny it.

430
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:14,062
Ask the guards! They'll deny it.

431
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:15,981
Ask the inmates here.

432
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:18,275
They'll cut their tongues out
before they talk.

433
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,944
But I have something to say to you.

434
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:23,905
When I finally get out of this cage...

435
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:28,702
I will dismantle the lives of the two
amateurs that put me in here!

436
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,374
You, Mr. Murdock,
and Franklin Percy Nelson.

437
00:27:33,457 --> 00:27:35,501
No, I... I put you here, not Nelson.

438
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:36,627
- No.
- I did it.

439
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,087
The two of you took the laurels.
You'll both take the blame.

440
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,548
I'll chop both the heads
off of that snake,

441
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:46,512
and I'll spend more than $6
on postage to bring you down!

442
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:51,433
You see, I've had a lot of time to reflect
on my journey here, Mr. Murdock!

443
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:56,813
My mistakes,
everything I took for granted.

444
00:27:56,897 --> 00:28:02,278
And while I try and sleep
in this bleak place...

445
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:05,364
the one thing that keeps me warm...

446
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:09,576
is the thought that I will
look down upon this city,

447
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,746
the city that birthed me,

448
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:16,667
with the woman that I love, who...

449
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,504
whom I love with everything that I am.

450
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:25,842
If you're worried that Frank Castle
will wreak havoc on Hell's Kitchen...

451
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,393
...just wait.

452
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:43,610
Time's up, Mr. Murdock.

453
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,238
Okay.

454
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,659
Let's do this again sometime.

455
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,068
Mmm, okay, so everyone's
got somebody down there.

456
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:26,987
Do we have anybody on the scene?

457
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,989
I know we got Manus at Metro-General.

458
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:31,241
Look, send Stantacki
down to the police department,

459
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:33,327
and, Sarah, why don't you get
to the fire department, all right?

460
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,579
We're gonna use the top one, okay?

461
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:38,457
What are you guys looking at me for?
Will you just get to work?

462
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,127
Holy shit!

463
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:45,464
Karen.
Tell me you were there.

464
00:29:45,547 --> 00:29:47,007
- I was there.
- Yeah...

465
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,718
Uh, well, do you need anything?
A med eval, maybe a blanket?

466
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:50,927
Next dumb question.

467
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:52,531
Hey, hey, will you just wait a minute?

468
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,682
- So, was this Frank Castle?
- That's what I wanna figure out.

469
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:56,808
- What does your gut tell you?
- No!

470
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:59,185
No, my gut is the last thing I can trust.
I need facts.

471
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,311
Okay, agreed.

472
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:01,855
All right. So if Castle did this, if...

473
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:03,524
- Uh-huh.
- ...he's not gonna stop.

474
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:05,442
Well, we gotta stay ahead of him here.
He took out the DA.

475
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:06,568
No... Allegedly.

476
00:30:06,652 --> 00:30:08,111
Fine. Who would be next on his shortlist?

477
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:09,530
Whoever crossed him.

478
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:11,532
I'm thinking a medical examiner
who falsified records?

479
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:12,658
- Tepper.
- Exactly.

480
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:14,660
He's probably still holed up
at that shit-ass motel.

481
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:16,870
Right. So, I was gonna go over there now.

482
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:19,039
Not alone, you're not.

483
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:24,920
Let's go.

484
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:09,631
Tequila.

485
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:12,133
Mezcal, if you have it.

486
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,307
Sounds great.
Same for me.

487
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:23,479
Thank you.

488
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:28,900
Thanks.

489
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:32,529
Is that a French accent I hear?

490
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:35,115
You tell me?

491
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:37,325
The whole bottle, please.

492
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:48,504
Another for the lady?

493
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,301
Where are you headed?

494
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:01,850
Far away. New York is over.

495
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:06,605
Winter jacket. Gorsuch.

496
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,026
Ski trip...

497
00:32:11,693 --> 00:32:12,736
Courchevel?

498
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:19,868
Far too early for Courchevel,
and anyway I prefer St. Moritz.

499
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:22,829
Shopping and slopes.

500
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:29,127
For a start, both my feet hurt
after a while. I'll need a bath.

501
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,754
I can draw one for you.

502
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:38,344
In a tub for two?

503
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:39,596
But of course.

504
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:41,932
How nice.

505
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,226
I get so lonely.

506
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:47,537
I guarantee that will not be a problem.

507
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,773
You're a gentleman.

508
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:52,025
Not always.

509
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:53,610
Good.

510
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:58,448
New York is done.
Hello to...?

511
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:00,534
Jacques.

512
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,368
Jacques Duchamps.

513
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:03,662
Louise Badeaux.

514
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,000
Louise. Funny...

515
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,797
I thought your name was Elektra.

516
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:18,051
How do you know my name?

517
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:21,054
I know who you are.

518
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:24,683
I know what you've done,
and who you have killed.

519
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:26,309
The list is long.

520
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,146
The pilot in Buenos Aires,
the lawyer in Berlin...

521
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,274
and that very messy episode in Morocco.

522
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,945
I'm still trying to understand
how one woman

523
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:40,240
can fit six bodies
in the trunk of a Maserati.

524
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,161
Are you gonna try to kill me?

525
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:48,164
Something like that.

526
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:51,877
Well, you ought to know...

527
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:57,007
it's rude to keep a girl waiting.

528
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,282
Just one body.

529
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:24,910
Shit-ton of bullets,
and a whole lot of blood.

530
00:34:26,452 --> 00:34:28,163
All signs point to Frank Castle.

531
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:30,373
- No, no. Uh, it's not his style.
- Wait, wait, wait.

532
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:31,667
No, really, I, I know him.
He wouldn't...

533
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,752
What do you mean, "Not his style"?
Come here...

534
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:38,006
Look, you wanna report the news,
or you wanna really get to the truth?

535
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:40,676
The first step is you gotta
put aside your personal feelings.

536
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:44,012
I... I mean about everything.
No matter how much it hurts.

537
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,640
This is not personal.
I'm just saying that this does not fit.

538
00:34:46,723 --> 00:34:48,975
All right, this is just...
That's just out of control.

539
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:52,896
Yeah, it's out of control because
Frank's a killer, all right? That's chaos.

540
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:57,192
Whatever good you saw,
whatever...

541
00:34:57,275 --> 00:35:01,112
you know, code of honor
that you understood...

542
00:35:01,697 --> 00:35:03,031
it was never there.

543
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:07,744
- You think I projected?
- Yeah.

544
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:10,664
Happens to the best of us.

545
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:12,708
Although, you know, why you'd
wanna see good in the man

546
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:16,127
who pulls the trigger is...
beyond me, but...

547
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:20,548
Do you know anybody else
who might be in danger?

548
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:23,301
Um...

549
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:25,929
Yes, uh, his nurse.
Uh, he's a janitor now.

550
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:27,513
- And there's some others.
- Okay, okay. So... So, listen.

551
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:29,307
You gotta... you gotta
get those names, all right?

552
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,893
We have to hand
everything we have to the NYPD.

553
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:34,104
We need to save
as many people as we can.

554
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:36,356
Yeah. I've got all the files
at my apartment. I could go right now.

555
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,274
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

556
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:43,780
Guys, can you come here?

557
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:48,869
Uh, what's this?

558
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:52,163
Oh, well, they're, um...
they're going with you.

559
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:53,664
- Are you serious?
- Mmm, yeah.

560
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:55,917
Yeah, I had one last string to pull,
so don't screw it up, okay?

561
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:58,419
No, Frank's not gonna hurt me.

562
00:35:58,503 --> 00:35:59,796
Frank's a psycho killer.

563
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,757
You would never have pulled this
patriarchal shit with Ben.

564
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,258
I can take care of myself.

565
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:04,550
You're right.

566
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,762
And I'll never make that mistake again.

567
00:36:08,554 --> 00:36:10,223
Not about someone I care about.

568
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:14,602
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.

569
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,354
Get the files.

570
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:18,148
Meet me back at the office in an hour.

571
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:19,983
Yeah. I'll be there.

572
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:23,403
Don't forget you owe me a cup of coffee!

573
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:47,844
Where am I?

574
00:36:48,762 --> 00:36:50,430
Hey.

575
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:52,933
You're in Metro-General,
and you're safe.

576
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:55,393
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

577
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:58,479
Lie very, very still.
You've been very ill.

578
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,941
Do you remember what happened?

579
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:07,864
Can you feel this?

580
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:11,492
Good.

581
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:12,786
Daniel.

582
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:15,246
Your father's here.

583
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,622
Thank you.

584
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:19,084
Is he okay?

585
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:23,088
Yeah. He's weak,
and he'll need another transfusion,

586
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:24,380
but he's coherent.

587
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:26,967
Hopefully the others
will respond the same way.

588
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,426
I don't know how to repay you.

589
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:31,221
Trust me, billing will find you.

590
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,641
I'll give you two a minute to catch up,

591
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:38,486
but then the police will be wanting
to question him sooner than later.

592
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:40,063
Yes, of course.

593
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:49,823
I'm... so sorry.

594
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,242
This is all my fault.

595
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:56,496
I promise... it's going to be better now.

596
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:07,257
Always the last place you look.

597
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:11,219
But you knew I was coming, huh?

598
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:13,679
I heard you.

599
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,099
Three stories down.

600
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:18,768
You do know
that sounds creepy, right?

601
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:23,148
Yeah, I've been told.

602
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:24,607
I brought you coffee.

603
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,984
No, thanks.

604
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:30,655
Right. Forgot, you like to suffer.

605
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:35,451
Well, the joke's on you...

606
00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:37,871
'cause our vending machine
coffee really sucks.

607
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:46,195
Thought you'd be with your friend.

608
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:52,343
Aren't you gonna ask me
how he's doing?

609
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:55,972
He's fine.
He's watching the game.

610
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,808
Jets are up, seven-nothing.

611
00:39:00,393 --> 00:39:02,270
Ah, he just changed the channel.

612
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:05,023
The hit was clean.

613
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:06,649
In and out.

614
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,069
They'll release him tomorrow.

615
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,992
You know, the bullet wound will
do wonders for his career in hip-hop.

616
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:20,871
You should pay him a visit.

617
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,916
I can't help him, Claire.

618
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,334
How do you know that?

619
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:26,502
- 'Cause he got shot.
- Not by you.

620
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:28,504
No, but I dragged him into this mess.

621
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:31,132
Maybe. Maybe...

622
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,262
Or maybe you need to start thinking about
climbing down off that cross of yours,

623
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:39,515
and spending some time
with us normal people for a change.

624
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:44,938
How are the other patients?

625
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:47,482
Alive... thanks to you.

626
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:50,276
You brought them in just in time.

627
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:52,988
And one's awake.

628
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:57,867
What do they remember?

629
00:39:57,951 --> 00:40:00,078
Nothing yet.
He's in and out.

630
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:03,539
But I got all their toxicology screens
back from the lab, though,

631
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:07,085
and they read like a cheap
science-fiction novel.

632
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,919
What's the report?

633
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:12,798
Eight separate unidentified
organic substances in their bloodstreams,

634
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:15,593
or what was left of their bloodstreams.

635
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:18,471
- What do you mean?
- They didn't just lose blood...

636
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,473
they were drained.

637
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:21,766
All of them.

638
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:25,895
Each bled, carefully, systematically...

639
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:28,189
probably for several months.

640
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:31,817
Yeah. Nobu took blood out,
but you're saying he put toxins in?

641
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,101
One of our doctors thinks that

642
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:38,074
maybe they were being used to incubate
the substances in their systems.

643
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:40,160
- Like human chemical farms...
- Jesus.

644
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:42,120
...that could be tapped as needed.

645
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:47,333
God!

646
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,460
I should have stopped this.

647
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:51,962
You know you kind of did, right?

648
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:53,548
Yeah, not soon enough.

649
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,218
I don't believe this.

650
00:41:02,348 --> 00:41:04,184
Hey, uh, St. Matthew...

651
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,311
enough with the hair shirt, already.

652
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:08,521
You know, we've got doctors on it.

653
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,440
Cops, labs...

654
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:12,442
You're not the only person
in Hell's Kitchen

655
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:14,652
who gives a shit about
what's going on here.

656
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:18,823
You look like hell,
you know that?

657
00:41:18,906 --> 00:41:22,118
And you're standing up here,
freezing your ass off playing guard dog

658
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:25,205
when what you really need
is probably three days' sleep.

659
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:28,374
Yeah, 'cause Nobu's gonna figure
out where we are.

660
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,543
And when he does,
I wanna be here.

661
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:32,587
Of course, you do.

662
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,880
Claire, what do you...
what do you expect from me, all right?

663
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:36,591
I'm flailing here.
A dead guy...

664
00:41:36,674 --> 00:41:41,011
A guy I witnessed burned to death,
is somehow back in Hell's Kitchen.

665
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:43,634
All right? On top of that,
Frank Castle kills the DA,

666
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,850
and Wilson Fisk runs the prison
that I sent him to.

667
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:47,393
How do you know that?

668
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:50,771
I went there.

669
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:55,568
Busy boy.

670
00:41:57,487 --> 00:42:01,116
Oh, jeez.
I thought it could work. I did.

671
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:03,826
The law...
But it feels useless.

672
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:06,079
Everything I do just gets undone.

673
00:42:08,414 --> 00:42:12,001
You're talking to someone who patches up
the same three crackheads every night.

674
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:15,505
I understand what it's like to be pulled
in a hundred different directions at once.

675
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:17,465
Not like this.

676
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:18,841
I'm done, Claire.

677
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:23,721
No more law. No more friends.

678
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:26,891
At best, they're a distraction.
At worst...

679
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:29,102
I put them in jeopardy.

680
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:34,232
From now on, I need to focus.

681
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:38,403
You may feel like
you are a ship lost at sea,

682
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:41,447
but if you isolate like this,
then you really will be.

683
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:44,242
You're cutting off your own anchor.

684
00:42:44,325 --> 00:42:45,618
Yeah.

685
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:52,333
And every minute that you spend...
standing, hiding in this suit of armor,

686
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:56,337
the more separate you become from
the very things that you wanna protect.

687
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:59,507
Your friend is in
a hospital bed downstairs.

688
00:43:02,843 --> 00:43:05,888
Stop playing the loneliest little soldier,
and come downstairs.

689
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:10,059
Be a human being...
and come say "hi."

690
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:13,979
That's all you gotta do.

691
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:21,321
Come on.

692
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,621
Matt?

693
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,541
Thanks for the coffee.

694
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:55,355
Clear.

695
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:05,240
You live alone?

696
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:08,409
You wanna ask me out,
or you wanna wait outside?

697
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:41,150
Officers?

698
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,738
Hello?

699
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,263
Hands on your head, Frank.

700
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,891
I mean it.

701
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:15,017
It wasn't me.

702
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,646
Hands on your head or I will
unload this thing, I swear to Christ!

703
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:21,023
It wasn't me.

704
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:24,109
Do it.

705
00:45:24,694 --> 00:45:26,987
Okay. Okay.

706
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,281
Hey.

707
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:52,221
Jesus Christ!

708
00:45:52,304 --> 00:45:54,139
You believe me now?

709
00:45:54,223 --> 00:45:55,558
I believe you.
I believe you.

710
00:45:55,641 --> 00:45:56,767
Okay.

711
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:58,978
You gotta get out of here.

712
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:00,355
Stay low.

713
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:02,106
Go, stay low.

714
00:46:39,602 --> 00:46:40,645
Miguel?

715
00:46:41,896 --> 00:46:42,980
Yes, Mr. Fisk?

716
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:47,192
I'd like you to call Mr. Donovan.

717
00:46:47,276 --> 00:46:50,571
I'd like to reexamine
Matthew Murdock's files.

718
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:51,947
Yes, sir.

719
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:16,365
Listen to me, asshole.

720
00:48:17,324 --> 00:48:20,661
I don't care what the Hand wants,
with me or anyone else.

721
00:48:20,745 --> 00:48:22,747
This is not my war.

722
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,583
The Hand didn't send me.

723
00:48:27,752 --> 00:48:29,086
Stick did.

724
00:48:58,073 --> 00:48:59,659
Great. Now what?

725
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,152
Hey. What are you...

726
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,703
Oh, my God.
What did you...

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
