<i>Attention all units...</i>

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,720
<i>Searching the living room...</i>

3
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,240
<i>Searching the top floor.</i>

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>The west room seems to be a classroom.</i>

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,920
<i>There are desks and a whiteboard.</i>

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,280
<i>No human presence.</i>

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,840

DIRECTOR

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,400
<i>Inspector,</i>

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,720
there is something else.

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
I only want forensics in there.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,320
You got it.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,520
Inspector.

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,720
The kitchen and bathroom
are full of remains.

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
Come with me.

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,520
What's that?

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,600
Looks like fish.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
Anchovies.

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,480
<i>Inspector, the purchase records they stole</i>
<i>at the pharmacy in Palomeque.</i>

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
They were in a drawer.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Damn.

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,800
The person that helps them was here.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,960
Less than 30 hours ago.

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,480
Put surveillance on all adjoining roads.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>Attention, cut all roads</i>
<i>within a ten kilometer radius.</i>

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,800
<i>Suspect may be near, I repeat,</i>
<i>suspect may be near.</i>

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,360
<i>Roger. Units on their way,</i>
<i>informing Traffic Control.</i>

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,880
<i>The inspector started secreting</i>
<i>adrenaline and cortisol.</i>

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,160
<i>Her heart rate</i>
<i>and blood pressure increased.</i>

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
<i>Like a lioness,</i>
<i>moments before hunting a gazelle.</i>

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,320
<i>She was excited</i>
<i>as she felt her prey closer and closer.</i>

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,240
POLICE INVESTIGATE BANK HEIST

33
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,680
COLONEL PRIETO,
DEPUTY INSPECTOR ÁNGEL RUBIO

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,520
We have eight different sets of prints.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
We have a match for one.

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,400
They belong to Silene Oliveira,
known as Tokyo.

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,920
<i>Raquel couldn't help but wonder</i>

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,280
<i>if those clues were actual leads</i>

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,360
<i>or another dead end.</i>

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,120
This doesn't make any sense.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
<i>Raquel was right.</i>

42
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
<i>The Professor had meticulously planned</i>

43
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,320
<i>to lead the police to Toledo,</i>

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,040
<i>leaving an Oscar-worthy crime scene,</i>

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,880
<i>littered with DNA from people</i>
<i>unrelated to the robbery.</i>

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,240
<i>What wasn't in his plans</i>
<i>was returning</i>

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,600
<i>to plant the prints of the ones</i>
<i>the police had already identified.</i>

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
<i>Berlin, Rio...</i>

49
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,320
<i>And me.</i>

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,720
<i>Also, throwing them off with</i>
<i>anchovies and the pharmacy records.</i>

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
<i>He intended to lead Murillo to a dead end</i>

52
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,640
<i>that would make her waste three days.</i>

53
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,560
<i>Three very productive days for us.</i>

54
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
<i>Since money prints</i>
<i>at eight million bills per hour.</i>

55
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
<i>Especially with the help of the hostages.</i>

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Come on, girls.
I need this counted in half hour, okay?

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
What's up with you? Wake up.

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Look, everyone else is smiling.

59
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,800
Let's get to work!
Work brings you dignity, damn it!

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,000
<i>Made into accomplices,</i>
<i>they hoped to one day receive</i>

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,760
<i>a million euros by mail.</i>

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,520
You are coming with me!

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,320
<i>Something didn't add up.</i>

64
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,600
<i>Between those walls there was nothing</i>
<i>they didn’t already know.</i>

65
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,560
<i>The Professor thought</i>
<i>it would take her three days,</i>

66
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,920
<i>but it took the inspector 50 minutes.</i>

67
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,920
Suarez.

68
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,640
Call Alberto, get him over here quick.

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,160
Alberto, your ex-husband?

70
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,120
He's the best forensic inspector.
Call him.

71
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,920
Attention, headquarters. Operating unit

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,400
<i>three one five, Toledo estate.</i>

73
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,120
<i>Inspector Murillo requesting the presence</i>
<i>of Inspector Vicuña at forensics.</i>

74
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
<i>Raquel, it's Julia, Paula's teacher.</i>

75
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,280
<i>Just to let you know that Paula's father</i>
<i>picked her up from school at lunch.</i>

76
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
<i>He said it was a family event.</i>

77
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,360
<i>I'd like to meet with you,</i>

78
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
<i>not regarding Paula,</i>
<i>she's doing well.</i>

79
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,160
<i>But her father wants to go out</i>
<i>with me after class and...</i>

80
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,280
<i>I'm not quite sure how to deal with it.</i>

81
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,640
-You can't be here.
-I know the inspector.

82
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,280
-Who?
-Raquel.

83
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,640
-Salva.
-I'm sorry, I just wanted to say goodbye.

84
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,600
-I apologize for this mess.
-No. You're working, don't worry.

85
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,320
It's okay.
I'll take the road we came in on.

86
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
The village will have a bus
to Madrid.

87
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,960
Wait. Suarez.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Is there any car going to Madrid now?

89
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,640
The first load of evidence leaves
for Canillas in a half hour.

90
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,160
I don't want to trouble you.
I'll catch a bus.

91
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,160
The main road is straight down here
and to the right.

92
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,120
-I saw a bus stop.
-Yes, there's one...

93
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Salva, it's no problem.
We will give you a ride.

94
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
Okay.

95
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
HOUR 80 OF THE HEIST

96
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,360
It's time.

97
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,240
We still have one minute until six.

98
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,440
Well, given the circumstances,

99
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,680
you can take your punctuality
and shove it.

100
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,240
Third call with no answer.

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,480
That's 18 hours with no news
from the Professor.

102
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,440
We know what that means.

103
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,640
CHECK-UPS
CYCLES - PROTOCOL

104
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,160
We'll do check-up calls every six hours.

105
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
What if you don't call us?

106
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,320
Or if you don’t answer the phone?

107
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,120
Well, if anything comes up,

108
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,200
you wait for the next call,
until we complete a four-call cycle.

109
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,600
Twenty four hours.

110
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,520
And if we haven't made contact with you
in 24 hours?

111
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,880
Then, it will almost certainly mean

112
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,920
that I've been arrested and interrogated.

113
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,120
We don't know anything
about the police either.

114
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm sure something is going on outside.
What do we do?

115
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,680
Well,

116
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,040
we still have one call left
to complete the cycle.

117
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
At 12:00 am.

118
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,640
What cycle?

119
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,840
-The fucking mousetrap cycle?
-Denver, relax.

120
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,880
The Professor must be tying up
some loose ends.

121
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,960
There's nothing to worry about. Yet.

122
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,040
For now, we keep watching the hostages
and printing money as usual.

123
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,880
-I'm going to rest up.
-Are you kidding?

124
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,240
We're stuck in this mess
and you're going to go fuck?

125
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,080
Tokyo, please.

126
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,120
-What?
-There's no need to be vulgar.

127
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,200
First of all, it doesn't suit you.
Second,

128
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,400
if I had to choose one of you as
a partner, hedonistically speaking,

129
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,760
it would be you.

130
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,240
What happened to<i> carpe diem?</i>

131
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,800
The plan fell to fucking pieces,
is what happened.

132
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,600
And maybe you don't care

133
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,760
because you're terminally ill, but I do.

134
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm leaving.

135
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,440
Son of a bitch.

136
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,880
-Another one.
-You are actually fucking a hostage.

137
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,080
Which one? That poor girl

138
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,040
that you have running around
like a fucking errand girl?

139
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
Not "poor girl".
Her name is Ariadna, Nairobi.

140
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,200
And yes, we get along.

141
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,000
The day we got here,
Ariadna was shaking

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,840
in a way that I recognized. Her...

143
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
fragility, her gentleness
awoke something in me.

144
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,080
What a load of crap!

145
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,400
There is nothing more despicable
than fucking a hostage.

146
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
Being with a hostage
isn't that bad either, is it?

147
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,680
What's the matter?

148
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,520
You can accuse me of being
good or bad at fucking,

149
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,320
but never of fucking at gunpoint.

150
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,640
Denver.

151
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,560
No.

152
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,040
So what?
Yes, I'm in a relationship too.

153
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,960
With Monica Gaztambide.

154
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,080
-What are you saying, son?
-I saved her life.

155
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,240
And she hugged me and kissed me.

156
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,560
I didn't force her into anything.
It was love.

157
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,400
What do you mean "love"? You idiot!

158
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,720
-Don't you know about Stockholm syndrome?
-No, Nairobi. I guess I don't.

159
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,080
But if she has a syndrome or illness
we'll get over it together.

160
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,800
No! You won't because
it's you who is causing it!

161
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Stockholm syndrome is when the hostage
develops feelings for the kidnapper.

162
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
She's scared as hell!

163
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,960
But you're fucking ignorant
and you think it's love.

164
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,600
What is wrong with you?

165
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,720
-What is wrong with you all?
-Enough!

166
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,760
We are not exactly Nobel Prize winners.

167
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,360
We have to stop bickering
amongst ourselves.

168
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
We're in a critical situation.

169
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,920
No, we will be if the Professor doesn't
call in six hours.

170
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,280
Then we'd put Plan Chernobyl into action.

171
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,640
The Professor didn’t say anything
about that.

172
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,200
What's Plan Chernobyl?

173
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,920
If all goes well, you'll never find out.

174
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,200
So, please, let's be patient.

175
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Okay?

176
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,600
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to clear my head.

177
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,000
Salva,
do you think I should drop the case?

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,440
Like, say that I'm not well
and take leave.

179
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,080
Give up.

180
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
That's a very personal question.

181
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,800
That's why I'm asking you.

182
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
We've slept together.
You've already met my mother.

183
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,200
I mean that it's a question
only you can answer.

184
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,040
Only you know how you feel about it.

185
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
I feel that this is too much for me.

186
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,320
If someone else was in my place...

187
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,560
Don't do that, Raquel.

188
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,320
If you're at the head of a case like this,

189
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,960
it's because there's nobody better
than you to manage it.

190
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,120
I don’t know. In the tent...

191
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,440
When I spoke with that guy,
the Professor who I negotiated with,

192
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,880
I felt useful.

193
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,760
Even if I had to answer questions like

194
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,240
-"What are you wearing?"
-"What are you wearing?"

195
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,720
But, I don’t know.
Here on the field, I feel like...

196
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,440
Like he's stronger than me,
I can't beat him.

197
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,760
I don't know. Look.

198
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,400
All those people working.
Thirty guys from forensics.

199
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,920
I don't know which way to go.

200
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,520
I feel lost.

201
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm sorry, Salva.
It must be getting late for you.

202
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,480
No.

203
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,320
Not at all.

204
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,000
<i>Inspector Murillo,</i>
<i>Forensic Inspector Vicuña is here.</i>

205
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,040
Would you come?

206
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Sure.

207
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,240
Hello, Raquel.

208
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,200
Thanks for calling.
It was very professional of you.

209
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,000
How is Angel?

210
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,960
Still in a coma. No news there.

211
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,760
This is Salva, a friend of mine.

212
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,880
More like my current partner.

213
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,280
Salva.

214
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,680
Inspector Alberto Vicuña.

215
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,120
Salvador...

216
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,000
Martin. Salvador Martin.

217
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,320
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

218
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,880
I'm glad you're with her.

219
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,280
I won't bother you.
You won't even know I'm here,

220
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
but you'll have to fill me in.

221
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,680
What's that?

222
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,880
Four hundred sixty thousand euros.

223
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,360
A little stash in case we get caught.

224
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,120
To start from scratch, you and me.
When we get out of jail.

225
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,800
I'm going to hide it here.
Behind our tile.

226
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,080
I'll make a hole and seal it up after.

227
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,920
In a few years we'll come back
and buy a condo in<i> </i>La Manga<i>.</i>

228
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
That is if the euro still exists.

229
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,880
Shit, you're right.

230
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,920
Listen.

231
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,800
You're not going to start again
about breaking up, are you?

232
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,520
Wait until we get arrested
and do it with a letter or something.

233
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,920
Listen to me.

234
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,680
Things are going to get real ugly.

235
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,640
I won't sit and watch,

236
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,920
I'd rather join the bloodshed.

237
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,280
I know.

238
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,520
But not you.

239
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,400
I need a favor.

240
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,800
When the party starts...

241
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,680
You will turn yourself in.

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
You'll wave a white flag
and turn yourself in.

243
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,640
It'll make things easier for you.

244
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,240
When things get complicated...

245
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I'll be with you.

246
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
When the party starts...

247
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
I'll be with you.

248
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,360
No matter what.

249
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,920
And you know what?

250
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,440
I only wave the white flag
when<i> </i>Real Madrid wins.

251
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,880
Okay.

252
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,240
So now what? Let's fuck?

253
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,680
Okay.

254
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,880
Not a good time?

255
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,120
Party time, then?

256
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,960
Party time.

257
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,960
Hey, come on.

258
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,920
Did you know about that syndrome?

259
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,640
Stockholm syndrome?
Yes, I had heard about it.

260
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,760
I never forced her, I swear.

261
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,280
I just brought her food and...

262
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,560
She wrapped her arms around my neck.

263
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,840
She tried to kiss me and wouldn’t let go<i>.</i>

264
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,160
I swear we kissed for real,
I even started dancing in front of her.

265
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,960
Look at her...

266
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,120
When have you had a girlfriend like that?

267
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,400
I had Vane.

268
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,560
-Vane?
-Vane was pretty.

269
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,200
Vane was neither pretty
nor smart nor good.

270
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,720
You were from the same world
and had things in common.

271
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,160
And what world is that?

272
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,360
A shitty one, right?

273
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,240
Look at her closely.

274
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,680
Look at her!

275
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,200
First of all, she's a civil servant.

276
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,920
That means she studied a lot.

277
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,360
Second, her last boyfriend was
the General Director of the Royal Mint.

278
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,680
And third,
she's incredibly pretty and refined.

279
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,560
She's out of your league, son.

280
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,560
She's in the Champions League.

281
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,640
-We're more in the regionals.
-Alright, that's enough, that's enough.

282
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,440
I get it!

283
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,480
I'm a loser.

284
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,880
I have to think like a loser.

285
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,920
And dream like a loser.

286
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,840
I get it.

287
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,000
Don't move!

288
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,160
She said don't move, damn it!

289
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,760
Hands on your head.

290
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,080
Hey! What's going on!?

291
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,160
This is very strange,

292
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,960
and no one's calling.

293
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,680
So if they're gunning us all down,

294
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,320
at least we'll find out on TV.

295
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,640
Right?

296
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,360
It's okay.

297
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,080
Monica Gaztambide, you're up.

298
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,360
In the first inspection, we found
the prints of eight people.

299
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,160
There's DNA in cigarette butts, gum,
toothpicks, even in a yogurt.

300
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,240
More than 100 items of classified evidence
and counting.

301
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,600
Looks like they wrote out the plan
on the blackboard.

302
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
We're trying to reconstruct it.

303
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,120
They left us their plan in writing?

304
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,440
Yes, well...

305
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
That's the question.

306
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,840
If this a contaminated crime scene,

307
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,240
or some lazy effort to destroy evidence.

308
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,680
They got into
the Royal Mint and Stamp Factory,

309
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,320
I doubt they are lacking
in effort or intelligence.

310
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,160
None of this is worth shit.

311
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,320
Angel is ahead of you
with the prints he found.

312
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,480
-What prints?
-He didn't tell you?

313
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,960
He got hold of a personal item,
a teaspoon.

314
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,680
It had the same prints
that we found in the police car.

315
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,240
Angel found someone from the group,
or was about to.

316
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,680
If there's anything here,
I know where to find it. Come.

317
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,640
Anything they really wanted destroyed,

318
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
they must have burned in here.

319
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
It's the safest way to destroy something.

320
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,440
It's what anyone would have done.

321
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,040
But there are only ashes in here,
and not many.

322
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,080
Ashes that used to be lumber, coal...

323
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,320
But also documents, photographs...

324
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,920
A paper that, when burned,
loses most of its material.

325
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,040
The fire creates a wisp of hot smoke,

326
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,600
that raises those paper particles
through the chimney.

327
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,480
Sometimes those particles stick to the
rough brick of the wall.

328
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,720
If there's anything, it's in there.

329
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,600
Let us get to work.

330
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,360
Gandia,
bring the goggles and the infrared camera.

331
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,000
Come on, girl, I'm in a hurry. Move it.

332
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,960
Move.

333
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,680
Get to work.

334
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,640
Turn around.

335
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,720
-You're serious today.
-No.

336
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,640
Stop! You'll make me spill it.

337
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,760
Right, you're going to spill it.

338
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,360
I mean it, Monica.

339
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,080
What's the matter?

340
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,080
Have we run through our 60 hours of love?

341
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,720
It just so happens that you're my hostage

342
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,280
So we'll see about that when this is over.

343
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,560
What?

344
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,760
What's the matter?

345
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,600
Come.

346
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,080
Am I missing something?

347
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,160
Maybe you haven't noticed
because you're here against your will,

348
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
but you have a syndrome.

349
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,760
-What syndrome?
-Stockholm syndrome.

350
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,680
You fall in love with...

351
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,960
The son of a bitch that kidnapped you.

352
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,480
You're losing your mind,
treating me like I'm your boyfriend.

353
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,360
-It's a mental thing that doctors treat...
-Listen.

354
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,000
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

355
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,240
Of course you'd say that,

356
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
you've got the syndrome.

357
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,960
-Denver, it's not like that.
-What if you saw me on the street?

358
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,880
What if I had ask you
for change for the slot machine at a bar?

359
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,880
Would you have noticed me at all?

360
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
Be honest.

361
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,360
I didn't think so.

362
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,600
That's it.

363
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,320
You go your way...

364
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
I'll go mine.

365
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
And that's it.

366
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Wait.

367
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,400
Do you have feelings

368
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,080
for me?

369
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,440
-I'm not suffering any syndrome.
-Denver.

370
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,920
Do you have feelings?

371
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,880
Yes.

372
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,120
But what I feel is real,
it's not because of Stockholm.

373
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,560
But you...

374
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,720
I can't let you lose your mind.

375
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,160
I can't.

376
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,120
I can't do that to you.

377
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,320
What's on your mind, green eyes?

378
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,920
I want to know everything about you.

379
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,040
Every day you've lived,

380
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,600
every smile, every tear.

381
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,520
Every happy moment.

382
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,320
You're a wonderful mystery to me, Ariadna.

383
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,960
For instance...

384
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,120
Let's see. Your first kiss.

385
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,320
Do you remember who it was?

386
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,960
What was his name?

387
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,800
Raul.

388
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,480
Raul.

389
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,560
Raul must have felt like a lucky man.

390
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,880
Like Neil Armstrong, walking on the moon.

391
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
First times are special.

392
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,480
Unique.

393
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,200
But the last times are beyond comparison,
priceless.

394
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,920
But people...

395
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,320
Don’t usually know it.

396
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,440
You see, I have six months left to live.

397
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Or four.

398
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,760
Maybe even less.

399
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
And one of the few things

400
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,880
that I really care about right now...

401
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,880
Do you know what it is?

402
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,560
To know...

403
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,440
That I will live in here.

404
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,920
In your mind.

405
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,480
Forever.

406
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,480
Inside this beautiful head.

407
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,960
Berlin.

408
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,880
Something happened. Something serious.

409
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,960
Excuse me, where are
the officers that were going to Madrid?

410
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,880
No one is leaving at the moment.

411
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,880
I see, then I'll have to walk
to the main road.

412
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,440
Can I just say goodbye to the inspector?

413
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Come with me.

414
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,880
Are you sure you want to do that?

415
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,920
You should take it all with you.

416
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,560
No.

417
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,200
Tomorrow these will
no longer be memories, just...

418
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,600
Evidence against someone
under an arrest warrant.

419
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,160
Besides, nostalgia can be seductive.

420
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,800
It is hard to let go of the memories
because we think...

421
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,440
That they really are happy moments, but...

422
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,880
They're not.

423
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,920
And what we will do tomorrow
requires us to think about the present.

424
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,160
Not the past.

425
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,600
That was your father.

426
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,760
BANK ROBBER JESUS MARQUINA
DIES IN A SHOOTOUT

427
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,080
AT<i> </i>HISPANO AMERICANO BANK.

428
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,600
That's all that matters.

429
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,080
We're doing it for him.

430
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,040
<i>More than 50 troops have moved</i>
<i>to the Toledo estate,</i>

431
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,920
<i>including the Chief Inspector,</i>
<i>the General Operative Sub-director</i>

432
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,560
<i>of Special Operations and forensic agents,</i>

433
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,440
<i>who continue to work in the house</i>

434
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,000
<i>where the heist may have been planned.</i>

435
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,520
The Professor was arrested.

436
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,840
They're interrogating him
in the house in Toledo.

437
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,880
<i>Although the judge declared secrecy,</i>

438
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,400
<i>forensic police may have found evidence</i>

439
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,080
<i>that confirm the presence</i>
<i>of at least three...</i>

440
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,080
Damn it!

441
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,760
Shit!

442
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,280
They cut off the signal.

443
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
We're screwed.

444
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,120
They don't want us to know.

445
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,400
And that means they're coming in.

446
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,320
We can sit here for five hours,

447
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,320
or fucking start Plan Chernobyl,

448
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,920
which sounds better to me.

449
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,120
Plan Chernobyl
is for desperate situations,

450
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,640
and I don’t think this is the
most desperate we can take, is it?

451
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
It's a plan in which you'd lose the money.

452
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,480
I have no desire to give it up. Do you?

453
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,520
Will you give up everything
you fought for, Tokyo?

454
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,440
Guys, they have the Professor.

455
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,800
There won't be a tunnel in the hangar,

456
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,040
because the fucking GEO will be waiting.

457
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,200
We're fucking trapped!

458
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,400
He will call within the next
five hours. I still believe in him.

459
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,200
I'm not big on democracy,
but suddenly I feel like voting.

460
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,960
Who still believes in the Professor?

461
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,360
Helsinki?

462
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,880
I believe in the Professor.

463
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,640
Rio.

464
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,200
I believe what I see.

465
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,400
And what I see
is that we can't count on him.

466
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,920
I'm with Tokyo.

467
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,240
Moscow.

468
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,840
I entered under certain rules,

469
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,240
and the rules have not been broken.

470
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,000
I trust the Professor.

471
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,400
Denver.

472
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,560
I vote to get out of here, now.

473
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,080
Being a multimillionaire doesn't suit me.

474
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,920
Alright, Denver.

475
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,960
Three and three.

476
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,400
Nairobi, your call.

477
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,960
You break the tie.

478
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,520
I have a very good reason
to be with the Professor,

479
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,200
and unless he's dead,
I'll believe in him until the end.

480
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm with Berlin.

481
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,040
Raquel,

482
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,640
Raquel, sorry to bother you but...

483
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,440
It's getting late, and...

484
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,240
I'm taking this to Canillas.

485
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Look, I was just going
to catch the bus for Madrid.

486
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,320
I can give him a lift.

487
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,600
What?

488
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, actually it works for me.

489
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,840
Let's go.

490
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,880
<i>Don't judge him.</i>

491
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,720
<i>Helsinki did what he had to do.</i>

492
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,120
<i>What soldiers do in war.</i>

493
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,400
<i>What we do with animals</i>
<i>to stop them from suffering.</i>

494
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,080
<i>Not in hatred,</i>

495
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,040
<i>but as an act of compassion.</i>

496
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,120
Put it down.

497
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,320
<i>I too did what I had to do.</i>

498
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,320
<i>Not in hatred,</i>

499
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,560
<i>but as an act of compassion.</i>

500
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,680
<i>After all,</i>

501
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,880
<i>what's more human than</i>
<i>the fight for survival?</i>

502
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,280
