1
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:08,761
We're locked up and we're really
we don't know how long this can last.

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:12,681
As long as you don't try to fool me,
everything will be fine.

3
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,521
We said no victims.

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,401
He had a phone,
Did you want me to spank him?

5
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:21,401
What the hell is going on here?
He's had a hostage executed.

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,281
Who was it?
Your son.

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:25,721
It's here, isn't it?

8
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,041
Your love story
has ruined your plan.

9
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,481
They've got you, and Río too.
The police know who you are.

10
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,441
You're on all the news.

11
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,281
Air intake.

12
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:44,761
You didn't kill that girl, did you?
I was ordered to do it and I had to do it.

13
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,601
You fucking killed Mónica!

14
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,121
- I have a visual of the targets.
- Behind you!

15
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,081
It's the first thing
that gets out of your plan.

16
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,561
They had it all figured out.
minus this shot,

17
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,881
and we must take advantage of it.

18
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,881
I have the ambulance.
No one is going to get out of here.

19
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:02,681
Let a medical team come in.

20
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,281
Two surgeons
and a nurse.

21
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:08,761
I frisked him, almost stopped him,
and you still care about me?

22
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:10,881
If you need any help...

23
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:13,121
Thank you. Thank you.

24
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,561
- Raquel, I want to go undercover.
with the medical team.

25
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,521
- Someone will come in, but you won't.

26
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,401
- Of course, there's always someone
better than me for everything.

27
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,561
- I've made the decision to enter.

28
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,121
They'll come in through the chest.
with red overalls and Dalí masks,

29
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,281
and infiltrate.

30
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:34,321
The sub-inspector will accompany the
surgeons and enter as a nurse.

31
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,881
A health worker is a policeman.
You know what to do.

32
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,641
They emit in short wave and encrypted.
They're coming in, I don't know where.

33
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:56,721
Active plan B.

34
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:09,521
Don't stop. Now.
Run now. Run now! Come on!

35
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:15,721
Abort! They have changed
the masks. They are not disguised as Dalí

36
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:17,761
They go straight to the slaughterhouse.
- Eh?

37
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,081
Attention, abort entry.

38
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,401
Suárez, do you copy?

39
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:28,881
- Objective reached

40
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,121
We proceed to remove lid
and we are inside.

41
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:39,081
Suárez, do you copy?
The masks have changed.

42
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,601
There is interference.
Command post, I can not hear you.

43
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:46,401
They do not wear Dalí masks.
It's a fucking suicide.

44
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,841
Abort entry...

45
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,761
That's an order!
they have changed the masks.

46
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,841
They do not wear Dalí masks.

47
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,841
Atenttion, do you copy?
Abort entry!

48
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,361
Abort.
- Yes!

49
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:05,241
Abort.

50
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:21,121
Berlín, all calm.

51
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:24,281
Plan B has worked
as planned. They go.

52
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,041
What the fuck were the masks?
- I don't know.

53
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,881
They had their mouths open
like that, as anguished.

54
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,841
Como, no sé,
"The Scream" by Munch. That.

55
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,801
¡Munch, the expressionist painter!

56
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:29,441
Dalí, Munch...
What will be next?

57
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:32,561
I'm very glad you ask me
that question.

58
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:37,281
If you had to change it,
which painter would you choose?

59
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,721
Eh... I don't know, ¿Picasso, maybe?

60
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,241
Goya.
Goya.

61
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:46,841
Velázquez.

62
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,121
Velázquez... Hm, hm...

63
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,801
Da Vinci.
Yes, with the beard.

64
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,441
I like it, with the beard.
Andy Warhol.

65
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,001
- ¿ The one with the soup?
¿Andy Warhol? Ángel.

66
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,361
- Yes, Andy Warhol,
that of Marilyn's painting.

67
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:07,761
He es a painter...

68
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:11,601
well-known, iconic.

69
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,921
The hair and the glasses.

70
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,761
Ángel, you are a box of surprises.

71
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,881
A bof of surprises with
a mic in the glasses.

72
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:25,761
without us ever anticipating.

73
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:29,721
But that is not the question, inspector,
and you know it.

74
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,881
That is not the important thing...

75
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:34,281
How the fuck they knew
that we were in there?

76
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,401
How much time have they spent studying

77
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,121
every movement what we are going
to do in each moment.

78
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,361
If I tell you the truth
half of my life.

79
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,721
How long are they going to stay inside?

80
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,721
Nothing, only nine more days.
10, 11 as much.

81
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:49,241
We're playing a fucking chess game

82
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,521
and we are loosing it.

83
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,201
But I have a Trojan horse.
It's very difficult for you to win this.

84
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,281
The moment has come to reflect...

85
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:58,601
and look back,

86
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:00,961
return to the origin.

87
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,121
We know that all this started
a long time ago,

88
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,721
and that those who were
inside were there before.

89
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,921
We have images of Cortés
and Oliveira entering the museum.

90
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,801
But did they come alone?

91
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:21,561
Was it the first visit they made
or the last?

92
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:24,161
How many more visits were there?

93
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:27,241
Did they talk to someone?
A gesture, a look...

94
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:30,681
and, above all, did they leave
some fucking thread to throw?

95
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:35,521
I want you to check again
the recordings of the cameras,

96
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,681
that you study them second by second.

97
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:40,201
The rest
let's try to rest.

98
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:42,961
Some of you
more than 30 hours without sleep.

99
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,921
Suárez, whatever you call me.

100
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,001
You are in command.

101
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,841
Brawl in Marcelo Usera,
Any patrol nearby?

102
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:51,921
- Please,

103
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:55,081
Leave channel eight free
for the hostage crisis!

104
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,641
Nobody issue
for channel eight, thank you!

105
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,361
- Do you want to take something
before going home?

106
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:03,881
- Between eating and sleeping,

107
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,801
I would choose the first, but...

108
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:07,241
I'm tired Ángel.

109
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,561
Sorry, thank you.

110
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,521
"Have you never thought that if you
could go back

111
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,921
maybe you would not make the same decisions?

112
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,001
Look at me:

113
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,401
If the day the Profesor
found me I wouldn't have gone with him,

114
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:25,001
now possibly I would be
telling you this from jail,

115
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:26,561
and not from where I do it."

116
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:30,201
How 2.400 million euros sound to you?

117
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,641
I guess at this moment
I only have two options.

118
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,601
I just see one.
I can surrender,

119
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,721
do therapy in jail,

120
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:45,521
play basketball,
go to mass...

121
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,321
and coming out at 50 knowing how to cook.

122
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,001
That...

123
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:56,881
or could make the snowball
larger and continue to slope down.

124
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:00,601
And...

125
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,161
What do you choose?

126
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:07,921
I choose snow ball.

127
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,881
"And it's that we all do
our own snowballs

128
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:14,601
with our bad decisions,
balls that are becoming giants,

129
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,321
like the Indiana Jones rock,

130
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,881
and he's chasing you down the slope
to crush you.

131
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,281
Berlín didn't care either.
shit his snowball,

132
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,721
no matter how big.

133
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:29,921
It was clear to me that whatever happened.
happened, he wasn't going to jail.

134
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,121
What about Allison Parker?

135
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:35,801
That dead mosquito, too.
had made a bad decision:

136
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:39,281
not going to the ballet audition
from Martha Graham's school.

137
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:41,441
for hiking with Pablito,

138
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,081
a fucking asshole.

139
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:04,961
All decisions
that we took in the past

140
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:07,801
take us inexorably
into the future.

141
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,721
That's what Río was going to realize...
as soon as I lit up

142
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,641
the only television
that we had left at the factory,

143
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:18,601
in case we ever lost.
communication with the Profesor."

144
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:20,681
Come on, kid!

145
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,081
Put him to see what they say about us.
This, not even the train robbery!

146
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:27,521
"An undetermined number
of assailants agreed to...

147
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:31,241
- The one we messed up!

148
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:33,881
"Is it a blow to the system?

149
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:36,521
The largest..."

150
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:39,761
- My goodness!
This, not the Americans!

151
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:42,641
This, Spain's brand
but with M16! Take it now!

152
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,681
Fuck, my parents!

153
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,721
"- A teenager... so rare...

154
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:49,841
- Shy...
- Shy.

155
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:53,881
Our son was always
locked in the room,

156
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,641
but we thought
he was playing with the computer or...

157
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,801
But you don't think
he is a criminal.

158
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,801
And then... you see it on TV
with a rifle, firing,

159
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,641
with 60 people locked up.

160
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,921
And you see it's like those jihadists.
- Paco...

161
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:14,201
- It's just that he's not your son anymore.

162
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:16,001
- Please don't say that.

163
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:19,241
- For me...
it's like he's dead.

164
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:20,601
- But, Paco...

165
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,561
We just heard
the testimony of the parents..."

166
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,161
The profesor said
nothing of external news.

167
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:36,041
"But he had also said that he wanted
a white heist, no blood,

168
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:37,601
without violence,

169
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,801
that only with intelligence...

170
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,681
we could perpetrate
the robbery of the century.

171
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:51,521
Sometimes intelligence
is not enough

172
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:54,121
to stop the snowball
that's coming for you.

173
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,161
And then you have to run...

174
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,201
and run...

175
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:01,761
and run.

176
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,801
But I got ahead of myself,

177
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:07,521
I'm telling you something
that hadn't happened yet."

178
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:41,241
Ángel, tell me.

179
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:42,761
- Hello, Raquel.

180
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:44,841
Were you asleep?

181
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,241
- No, no, no, what is it?

182
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,841
- No, no, no, no, no.

183
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,481
It's all right, don't worry.

184
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:56,321
Look, I'm walking around
to a topic. Do you have a minute?

185
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,401
Leave her alone, man,
she'll be devastated.

186
00:12:58,521 --> 00:12:59,721
Yeah, sure, yeah.

187
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:03,721
- Forgive me for being so direct:
What's with Andy Warhol?

188
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:07,241
- Excuse me?
- The thing about the surprise box.

189
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:11,401
What's the matter, that I can't like
museums or modern painters?

190
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,441
I can't like something
other than Atleti?

191
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,121
- Yes, of course.

192
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:19,441
It has caught me from... surprise,
because I didn't know.

193
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,961
The same thing I didn't know
that you are a fan of Atleti.

194
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:24,081
- But it does hit me, doesn't it?
Yes, it does.

195
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,161
Well, yes.

196
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:29,281
Hey, Ángel, I'm really tired.
Shall we talk tomorrow?

197
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:33,601
- The guy I saw you with,
that you were holding hands.

198
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,281
Would you sleep with him?

199
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:42,081
Tell me, I want to know.
- Ángel, what's this all about now?

200
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,121
- Would you go to bed with him?
yes or no?

201
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:46,561
Answer me.

202
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,961
Yes, yes, why not?

203
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,721
I'm a 40-year-old free woman,

204
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,601
and the truth is, I could use it,
a good wiggle,

205
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:00,281
to... have something different
to think about.

206
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:02,641
So I'm sure you do.

207
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:04,721
So what?

208
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,761
I understand. You want to give an opportunity
to a random guy. I get it.

209
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:15,441
- Ángel...

210
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:20,241
What happened between you and me
in Cercedilla was an adventure.

211
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,281
It's been eight years and look,

212
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,641
I cut to the chase
because we're partners.

213
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:28,561
- And friends, Raquel.
- And friends.

214
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:31,321
And you're married, Ángel.
- I'm married.

215
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:34,921
Because you said that between
was not going to work.

216
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,561
Then you got married,
and on top of it with a partner.

217
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,881
And because you never look at me like...
to a winner, you always look at me

218
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:44,001
like the loser who...
can't like Andy Warhol.

219
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:47,001
But if for a moment
you look at me like a man,

220
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:51,281
I swear it didn't take long.
nor ten minutes to leave Carmen...

221
00:14:57,601 --> 00:15:02,121
Forgive me. Raquel, I'm sorry.
Hell, I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

222
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,961
It's this... job,
that's driving us crazy.

223
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,841
- Yes, yes, that's true, but to everyone.

224
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:16,241
Ángel, it's late. Go to bed, huh?
We'll talk tomorrow.

225
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,121
- Good night, Raquel.
- Good night.

226
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,881
Who were you talking to?

227
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:53,001
- I can't believe it.
that you were spying on me.

228
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,841
- I couldn't help overhearing you.
- To bed, which is late.

229
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,201
- A good time.
I've already slept.

230
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:00,921
Look, let's see,
And you now, what's up?

231
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,321
- What?
- Two suitors.

232
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:05,001
- He's not a suitor,
it's Ángel, my partner.

233
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,481
- Oh, well, I thought
that you were making him jealous

234
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:10,201
with the stranger at the bar,
with the one with the reeds.

235
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:13,761
Please, Mom,
I wasn't making him jealous!

236
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,481
- You... don't close doors.

237
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:18,281
And now that you're not married,
you can go pecking.

238
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:20,041
- Ah, pecking.
- Yes, pecking.

239
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:24,801
- Of course.
- Daughter, in the end love is...

240
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:28,121
what makes us see other colour of life.

241
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,841
And you lately
you see everything very black.

242
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:40,681
Maybe it's still
you haven't gotten over... all that.

243
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,761
- Let's see, Mom, let's see,
What haven't I overcome, huh?

244
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:46,841
Do you also think I've put
a false allegation...

245
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:50,601
and that I live bitter because my ex
He's hooked up with my sister

246
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:51,961
and I want to fuck them up?

247
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,481
Does your husband
made out with your sister?

248
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:58,721
- Mom, what do you say?

249
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,561
What?
- Nothing. Yes...

250
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:07,481
I just wanted to calm things down.

251
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,921
In the end that man
has made out with the two sisters

252
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,681
as in the movies...
erotic films.

253
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:18,081
Mom. Mom, are you okay? Mom, are you okay?

254
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:23,761
- Eh...

255
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,561
How are you doing with
the robbery, daughter?

256
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:30,201
- Eh... Bad, bad. Bad.

257
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:32,921
Well, sitting there all day,

258
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,241
in a blocking situation, and...
Yes.

259
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:38,321
- But are you sitting, my daughter?

260
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,041
What you have to do
is run.

261
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:44,881
Bad guys get caught running.
As if you didn't know.

262
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:53,321
Good night, sweetheart.

263
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:35,081
Ah.

264
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,561
What a pleasant visit!

265
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,601
You should come here more.

266
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,441
I see you've put yourself
a very cuckoo dispatch.

267
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,521
You already have two.
I like offices.

268
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:02,761
Always...

269
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:06,881
I've wanted to have one.
with the mahogany desk,

270
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,801
but the crime and the dispatches
do not marry.

271
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:15,841
It's hot, isn't it?

272
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:23,401
You put on your vest.
bulletproof to come see me.

273
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,441
I would have preferred a corset,
Venetian.

274
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,001
See?

275
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:34,561
If I'm not done
to get the point.

276
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,001
What are you here for, Tokio?

277
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:41,441
To ask you...

278
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:46,481
please...

279
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:50,481
that you call the profesor...

280
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,601
and tell him what you've done,

281
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,161
that you've had executed
to a hostage.

282
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:59,361
Bad boy.

283
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,481
Because you know what happens?

284
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:12,521
That the profesor
is my guardian Ángel,

285
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:15,361
and if you don't tell him,
I'm gonna have to do it myself.

286
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,441
You?

287
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:19,321
Uh-huh.
Ah. And you'll look like an accuser.

288
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,801
A snitch, a filthy rat.

289
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,121
I am a gentleman,
is something I couldn't allow.

290
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,721
Yes.
I have breached the first rule.

291
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,521
I killed a hostage.

292
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:20,961
Well, not me, but Denver,
but that's the least of it.

293
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:24,601
Let's just say he's done it in compliance
strictly my orders.

294
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,881
I preferred to tell you myself.
personally.

295
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,361
It was the only red line.

296
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,761
You fucked it all up.

297
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:51,721
I understand your shock.
You fucked it all up.

298
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,241
That woman had a phone
between the legs.

299
00:21:56,681 --> 00:22:00,401
Maybe he wanted to use it
to call his cousin Chelito...

300
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:03,281
and tell that she was fucking
the director,

301
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:06,281
but I actually think
she wanted to call the police.

302
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:14,121
There won't be any more phones.
You can be sure of that.

303
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,401
Who was she?

304
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,281
Mónica Gaztambide.

305
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:31,561
Are you going to punish me?

306
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,601
You should.

307
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,321
I know you're an idealist,

308
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:41,841
you think they're gonna give us
the tickets by asking for them please,

309
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,281
that you want to be a good guy
while you give us weapons and explosives

310
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:48,361
to blow up this building,
but that's enough of games.

311
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:50,921
You're gonna have to punish me,

312
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,961
because if you don't have the guts,
this isn't gonna work out.

313
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:57,121
I've told you many times.
for years...

314
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:03,041
it's not me who has a problem,
it's you.

315
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:08,361
You're gonna have to punish me
because then I'll know you're a captain,

316
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,521
that can hold the rudder steady,

317
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:13,881
that you're someone
who can be trusted.

318
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:19,401
Looks like you don't want to talk about it
now.

319
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:22,761
At the moment no one knows outside
about this death,

320
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,881
so the plan goes ahead.

321
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,281
They'll ask for proof of life
in less than 48 hours.

322
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:02,001
Yes.
- Inspector, this is Suárez.

323
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:05,001
We found something
in the security footage.

324
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,441
It's important.
- I'm coming.

325
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:21,801
Here.
- Thank you, Ángel.

326
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:24,601
We've checked the hard drives
from the cameras of...

327
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:26,361
- Listen, listen, Raquel,

328
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,841
I wanted to apologize.
for last night.

329
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,201
I hadn't slept in 48 hours,
I'd had a few too many wines.

330
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:36,441
I don't want you to think...
- Ángel, don't worry.

331
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,081
It's okay, okay?

332
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:42,081
Look, Suárez has found
a breakthrough for the case.

333
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:45,121
It's the recording of the day
that Aníbal Cortés and Oliveira

334
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:46,281
visited the museum.

335
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,961
Look at the elements that deposit
in the inbox.

336
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,681
Get as close as you can.

337
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,041
There, stop it. Enlarge.

338
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,921
It's a car key.

339
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:07,881
From a Seat, old,
with original key ring.

340
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,921
- Presumably
between 89 and 96.

341
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,201
- We have the day and the hour
they entered,

342
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:16,481
and the model of car
when they did it.

343
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:19,681
Let's comb the area.
Security cameras,

344
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,921
car parks, shops, banks,

345
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,201
regulated parking tickets,
everything.

346
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,441
- Discard.

347
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:27,361
The other file, upload.

348
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:29,801
You have to find that
car anyway.

349
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:31,161
- Go on through. Good.

350
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:32,561
We got him.

351
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:36,961
- It's a '92 Ibiza.

352
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:40,761
- That's perfect.

353
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:45,041
Those keys and that car
they're going to take us where it all started.

354
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:50,961
Shut up.
Here are the car keys.

355
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:53,601
Nairobi and Río, change your clothes.
to go to the museum.

356
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,921
Me? Really?

357
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,401
You.
To the city?

358
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:02,001
Ah! No, but don't send me with the
child, send me with a big guy,

359
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:05,081
with Helsinki. Why don't you send me
with Helsinki?

360
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:07,361
- Helsinki likes
more hair on his chest.

361
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:08,441
- Huh?

362
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:13,881
Weren't you and I going?

363
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:17,721
Check the security cameras against
the sketch of my previous visit.

364
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:21,241
We need to confirm the location,
angles and targets.

365
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:27,281
Come on, change your clothes.

366
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:33,201
Helsinki, trout.

367
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:41,601
Oh, my God!
But you like men.

368
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:43,921
War, prison...

369
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,321
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Not the women.
- Mmm...

370
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:48,561
No, you don't.

371
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,521
Wasn't I going with Río?
No, I changed my mind.

372
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:52,641
Yeah? What happened?

373
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,361
I've changed my mind and that's it.

374
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:02,401
What has happened?
Don't you trust me or what?

375
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:06,161
Did I do something?
What the hell did I do?

376
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:09,601
So...

377
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,121
Yes, he, he.

378
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,121
I didn't do anything, did I?

379
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:17,281
It's not that.

380
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,801
No, no, no, no.
Did something happend?

381
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:31,921
My mother?

382
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:39,681
Cardiac arrest, I'm sorry.

383
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:44,641
When?
Yesterday.

384
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,721
I've decided
that you don't go out to the museum

385
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:50,881
to avoid the temptation
to say goodbye.

386
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:53,521
I'll stay with her.
Let another go.

387
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:58,201
I don't need to say goodbye.

388
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:00,561
I already did.

389
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:07,081
The last time I talked to her.
I wanted to turn myself in to the police,

390
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:09,201
so that woman
was no longer my mother.

391
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:29,801
Profesor.

392
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:33,481
You tell me what to do with Berlín.

393
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:36,561
Did I throw him to the dogs
or do I shoot him?

394
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,201
You're the boss.
We'll talk later. Put me through to Helsinki.

395
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,241
won't it be the police?

396
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:47,321
Come on, here.

397
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,481
Helsinki.
Yes?

398
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:54,841
The picture you brought me
of the scrap bucket

399
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:56,361
is from the Ibiza, isn't it?

400
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:00,121
I'm saying this because I'm looking at it
in detail and...

401
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,841
I get the impression
that the colour of the paint

402
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,401
is not exactly the same.

403
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:06,721
I leave car in scrapyard.

404
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:11,601
Helsinki, the photo
you brought me is from the Ibiza?

405
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:18,241
No.
Another car, but they said:

406
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,401
"It will look like this.
I gave you 1000 euros,

407
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,081
1000 euros for you to pay them...

408
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:27,681
and scrap your car
in front of you.

409
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:30,321
What did you do, did you keep
with 1000 dirty euros

410
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:32,761
when we're going to strike a blow
of 2 billion?

411
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:35,361
Two billion,
money flying...

412
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:40,281
and 1000 euros,
money in hand.

413
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:43,721
Me locked up without working
five months in Toledo...

414
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:45,601
and family...

415
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,921
I send all money to my family.

416
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,201
If for you 1000 euros...
not important,

417
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:53,681
very important to me.

418
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:56,481
Important, Helsinki.
That car is a loose end...

419
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,801
and from there they can get another one,
and another, and another.

420
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:02,361
We in here
leave a lot of loose ends,

421
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:03,881
you out there just one.

422
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:06,441
It's all right.

423
00:30:07,201 --> 00:30:10,441
Tell me, at least, if not
scrap the car in front of you,

424
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:11,961
if you cleared the fingerprints.

425
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,401
Yes. Yes.

426
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:20,801
Helsinki, what are footprints?
Fingerprints? Yes, Profesor, yes. fingerprints.

427
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:24,721
What does "fingerprints" mean?
Mmm.... No... I don't know.

428
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:28,521
Did you clean the steering wheel with ammonia,
the gearshift lever,

429
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:31,001
the windows,
the whole damn car?

430
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,081
Yes.

431
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:36,161
No. I didn't do this.

432
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,481
Get me the kidnapper.

433
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:52,601
- Sleeping is good for you.
This morning he took a run.

434
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,681
- To thieves
they are caught running,

435
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:56,281
and we're too passive.

436
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,361
Where's my pencil?

437
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:08,521
Let's squeeze the pins.

438
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:35,121
Good morning, Profesor.

439
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:38,361
How is Mr. Román
after the operation?

440
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,201
All right.

441
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:43,041
Resting and the best of all,
without fever.

442
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:46,041
I thought I'd forgotten.

443
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:47,121
On the contrary,

444
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,561
in point of fact
I keep thinking of you.

445
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:51,721
Wow, that sounds like fantasy.

446
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:55,361
We should keep investigating
that way.

447
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,441
If you're going to ask me
what I had for breakfast,

448
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:59,441
if I've had a morning orgasm

449
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:03,161
or if I like preliminaries,
I'll tell you that's not what this is about,

450
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:06,801
but yes, it is a fantasy,
a fantasy about handcuffs.

451
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,121
I put them on...
and put him in the van.

452
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:12,481
Well, it's a fantasy,
after all.

453
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:16,841
Sure, and then if you want to
tell me yours in a vis a vis.

454
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,921
Listen to me carefully:
I'm going to give you some bad news.

455
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:24,521
First of all, the ship
you asked for, the Malaika,

456
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,401
is docked awaiting trial,

457
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:28,601
whereby
is still their owner's.

458
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,721
That's no excuse, Inspector.
The police can ask the judge

459
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:37,321
the authorization to use that ship
in repression or persecution

460
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:41,641
of crimes, as long as
the judgment has not been delivered,

461
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:43,801
so you can ask permission
to use it,

462
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,241
especially in a matter
on such a large scale.

463
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,761
Don't tell me you haven't.

464
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,561
I see you also know about laws.

465
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,321
Well, just amateur.

466
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:57,081
I like
read court judgments.

467
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,561
You'd be surprised how passionate
that they can become.

468
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:03,921
All right, I'll keep that in mind.
now that I'm going to have time.

469
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,561
I'm going to be relieved of the case.

470
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,401
We're on a dead end.

471
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,201
Too many hours have passed...
and, as you will understand,

472
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:16,361
my superiors have a limit.

473
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:21,081
If you really want to negotiate with me,
release eight hostages.

474
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:26,801
Eight hostages,
and I want them to be minors.

475
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,601
Why should I?

476
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:39,681
Because now it's your turn
to have a gesture with me.

477
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,561
If you want credit,
release those hostages.

478
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:45,481
If not,
they'll put another inspector in charge,

479
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:47,841
someone with other ideas
and other objectives.

480
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:50,601
I give you an hour to think about it,
not one more minute.

481
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:05,361
That guy doesn't want the Malaika.
for nothing.

482
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:06,601
- Why do you say that?

483
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:09,481
Why ask for one
that it will take five days to get

484
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:13,161
could have any one of them?
- To see who has it longer?

485
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:16,761
Look, inspector, I don't know.
give them that boat and get them out of there.

486
00:34:21,841 --> 00:34:23,761
- They're thinking of going out
somewhere else.

487
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,521
Ángel.
- Tell me.

488
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,761
- Call those in the Underground,
to comb the sewers

489
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:30,241
within a radius of 500 meters.

490
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:33,161
Ancient tunnels, drainage...
Any hollow.

491
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,201
- Okay.
- Let's get to work!

492
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:21,401
Ah! Ah!

493
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,441
Ah...

494
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:02,241
Hey! You!

495
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,601
Hey!
I finally found you!

496
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:07,681
I was trying to...

497
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:27,321
Ah!

498
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:28,841
Ah! Ah!

499
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:30,361
Put me down!

500
00:37:35,441 --> 00:37:38,801
Please put me down! Please!

501
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:43,121
No! No! Please!

502
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,481
Put me down! Please!

503
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:46,921
I'm in the trunk!

504
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:55,841
Oh!
Save.

505
00:37:57,081 --> 00:37:59,601
Salva?
Yes, tell me.

506
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:03,921
Salva, I am Raquel.
Nothing, I'm here at the Hanoi...

507
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,681
ingesting sth.
y... well, that... as I don't see you here

508
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:11,121
and it's almost a custom
to find us here, then...

509
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:14,761
I thought that maybe...
he wanted to take a cup of coffee

510
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:17,401
or make a "break"...
Well, then...

511
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:20,761
I would love to, but is that...
just got me out of Madrid...

512
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:25,641
Salva, are you all right?
No, forgive me, it is that...

513
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,561
how I'm distracted,
a truck almost rolled me up!

514
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,161
Well, forgive me,
I won't keep you any longer.

515
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:32,961
Nothing, I'll see you around.

516
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:36,881
And if you come back soon and feel like
eat something today...

517
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:43,241
Forgive me, Salva, who...

518
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:46,841
The thing is, yesterday
I told my mother about you and...

519
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:50,161
Like the woman is a hippie
crazy of life, then...

520
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:52,921
nothing, that goes and told me,
in point-blank,

521
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,721
that maybe I should put
a little colour to my life

522
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:59,441
and get to know each other better, peck each other...
Don't get me wrong, huh?

523
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:03,041
Peck... She was referring to...
to have a social life,

524
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:06,241
That's why I told him about eating today.
Okay.

525
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:09,361
What...? Oh, is that so?
Oh, that's great!

526
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:11,801
Dinner, better?
Perfect!

527
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,521
Of course I do.
Well, that's fine.

528
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:17,561
Well, I'll see you.
Bye, bye!

529
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:18,881
Bye, see you later!

530
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:26,481
Please!

531
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:00,041
You don't smoke?

532
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,841
Good, good.

533
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,321
It won't be me.
who damages your health.

534
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:19,281
You're all right here, aren't you?

535
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,481
All together.

536
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,521
Without perceiving the horror,

537
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:30,681
the shots,

538
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:35,641
blood, interventions...

539
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:39,681
I have to come more often.

540
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:43,681
It's all complicated out there.

541
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,281
Tonight...

542
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:54,281
I called a friend.

543
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,041
I've told him how difficult it is

544
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:02,681
maintain order and harmony
in here,

545
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:07,041
and I have... said
I've had to kill,

546
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,721
that I have ordered killed...

547
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:15,401
a woman.

548
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:21,921
If you don't put corpses on top of the
table, you're not respected out there.

549
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:24,561
And you see, I...

550
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:31,361
I have been able to feel...
the emotion of my friend,

551
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:36,761
his awe,

552
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:39,641
your breathing...

553
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,041
agitating...

554
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,641
and your pain.

555
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,161
He...

556
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:56,801
He wasn't here,
nor did I know that woman,

557
00:41:57,521 --> 00:41:58,921
Mónica Gaztambide,

558
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:03,281
and for a moment...

559
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:14,881
For a moment I thought
that it would be very nice to feel...

560
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:17,561
how my friend feels.

561
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:26,081
To feel that...
kind of emotion, that pain,

562
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:30,841
that guilt, but not...

563
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:34,881
It doesn't move me.

564
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:38,801
Horrible, isn't it?

565
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:50,681
I'm bothering you with my
nonsense, you have to forgive me.

566
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,761
Silvia.

567
00:42:55,081 --> 00:42:56,041
Silvia.

568
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:01,001
You're having a seizure.
of anxiety, right?

569
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:04,241
- She's just a little nervous,

570
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:06,761
but it'll pass right away.

571
00:43:14,281 --> 00:43:15,241
Of course.

572
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:18,401
Of course she'll get over it.

573
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:19,761
Come with me.

574
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,201
Silvia, give me your hand.

575
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:28,201
That's it.

576
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,721
No... No...

577
00:44:03,361 --> 00:44:06,921
"Spasiba".
I got in because my car is here

578
00:44:07,121 --> 00:44:10,841
and I forgot something very important
in the trunk, very important.

579
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:13,161
"Ochen' vazhno".

580
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:16,521
You jump fence.
Now, tell police.

581
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:39,681
I count five and let go of dog.

582
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,001
Do you understand?

583
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:09,401
What are you doing?
I'm mounting the cells

584
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:12,041
for placing explosives
in the entry lanes.

585
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:15,361
Did Berlín ask it for you?

586
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:19,081
The Profesor, as a deterrent,

587
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:21,121
to be seen in the tent.

588
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:22,721
What's that?

589
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:27,601
This one, which I had here
a sherry and I'm giving it a way out.

590
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,681
Fuck!

591
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:40,881
Boss,

592
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:47,681
the post of Director-General
suits you... very well.

593
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:53,081
Sit down, please, Miss Tokio.

594
00:45:57,561 --> 00:46:01,161
I saw that you were late.
I'm going to have to account for that.

595
00:46:01,601 --> 00:46:04,321
I'm so sorry, Mr. Director.

596
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,721
Ah... Yes...

597
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:12,481
If I show you a breast,
You won't fire me?

598
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:15,481
A tempting offer, no doubt,

599
00:46:17,161 --> 00:46:19,281
but you have to offer me
something else.

600
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:23,121
Ah...

601
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:46,521
I know how you feel.

602
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:00,201
Río...
I am here,

603
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:04,481
stuck in this hole,

604
00:47:05,801 --> 00:47:08,481
and I'm starting to think
on how I got here...

605
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,241
and I don't remember.

606
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,081
I remember one day...

607
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:20,041
they asked me to check.
a security system

608
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:22,361
and it turned out to be a mansion.
in Geneva,

609
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:24,481
where not even the carpets remained.

610
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:27,241
I wasn't even there...

611
00:47:28,961 --> 00:47:31,401
But, fuck it,
hack security systems

612
00:47:31,521 --> 00:47:35,241
is so much more fun than being
the computer scientist of a company.

613
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:41,481
So I didn't even think about it.
For me it was a game...

614
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,241
and now I don't have any parents.

615
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:53,561
I don't have a mother either.

616
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:56,921
But it's a little different, isn't it?

617
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,481
My parents are still alive.

618
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:06,441
I could have been a legal uncle.

619
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:11,641
He was good at what he did,
could make money.

620
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:17,721
I could have had
a normal life,

621
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:20,321
to meet a normal girl,

622
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:23,601
have normal friends...

623
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:30,281
I wasn't like you.

624
00:48:38,721 --> 00:48:40,321
I just don't know what to tell you.

625
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:44,881
I think I need your door.

626
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,601
Which door?
The door you told me about the day

627
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,721
that we came to visit the museum,

628
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:54,961
the day we found out
that your mother died.

629
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:04,481
Cameras 12 and 13
have changed targets.

630
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:07,761
Now you have
a wider viewing angle.

631
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:25,041
Camera 14 is still the same.

632
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,761
He's focusing for the lobby.

633
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:37,241
We can go now.

634
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:42,281
And what are we going to leave for?

635
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:46,721
For a day we can do
a little tourism...

636
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:49,041
Kissing in bars,

637
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:52,481
in the street...
In the street?

638
00:49:54,081 --> 00:49:56,361
Don't fuck around.
Let's see if someone will catch you.

639
00:49:58,481 --> 00:49:59,681
No, not on the street.

640
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:04,801
Follow me.

641
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:47,921
I feel like I killed her...

642
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,161
So pretty that it was...

643
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:59,161
I've killed her with grief,
of absence, of displeasure,

644
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:03,321
of my fucking life, fuck...

645
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:18,121
She just wanted to protect me.

646
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:24,281
He loved me.
Ugh...

647
00:51:25,561 --> 00:51:26,881
He loved me madly.

648
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,721
And if I wanted to turn myself
in to the police, was...

649
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:36,921
so I don't look dead
in the news.

650
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,801
When I was little,

651
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:45,641
I knew that by his side
nothing would happen to me.

652
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:50,641
The bad thing was when he wasn't there.

653
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:53,961
And your father?

654
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:56,721
Father, there is none.

655
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:03,081
My mother
worked in a suitcase factory.

656
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:09,161
And when we didn't get there.
at the end of the month,

657
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:11,801
he took a night shift.

658
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,921
And since I didn't have
with whom to leave me,

659
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,201
for I was left alone.

660
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:27,241
I was scared...

661
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:29,601
How old were you?

662
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:34,441
Eight, nine.

663
00:52:35,881 --> 00:52:37,521
A little younger than you now.

664
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:51,121
The case...
is that my mother invented a trick.

665
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,001
He painted a door...

666
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:58,641
on the wall of my room...

667
00:53:00,121 --> 00:53:01,521
It was a magic door,

668
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:04,521
and if I was afraid,

669
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:08,481
I could open it
and she'd be on the other side.

670
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:13,681
And when he left, did you open it?

671
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,441
He told me
I could only open it once.

672
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:23,161
Only once,

673
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:24,761
in life,

674
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:28,121
when he needed it,

675
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:32,921
but once.

676
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:39,761
So when I was afraid...

677
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,001
I always thought:

678
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,881
"You can still hold on
a little bit more."

679
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:49,841
"A little more."

680
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,641
I thought the next day
I could be more afraid...

681
00:54:00,161 --> 00:54:01,601
and feel more alone,

682
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,641
and need the door.

683
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:16,641
I would have opened it the first day.

684
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:22,641
I never opened it.

685
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:31,361
You're the person
stronger than I know,

686
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:35,281
the most incredible...

687
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,001
y...

688
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:41,601
So what?

689
00:54:44,921 --> 00:54:46,321
So what?
Y...

690
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,081
Holy shit!

691
00:54:50,361 --> 00:54:52,361
You, the parking lot.

692
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:55,241
A fine?

693
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:58,081
- Yes, of regulated parking,
of a '92 Ibiza.

694
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,601
Two streets from here.
Look at the date and time.

695
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:05,681
It coincides with the day when the
robbers visited the museum.

696
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:07,441
Good work, Ángel.

697
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:10,321
Put the license plate in.
in the database.

698
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,441
It'll be the most expensive fine
of history.

699
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:14,881
It'll cost you
a lot of millions of euros.

700
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:16,441
Get me the robber.

701
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,001
Inspector.
Profesor,

702
00:55:31,521 --> 00:55:35,121
I need an answer. I want
those eight hostages, the minors.

703
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:38,321
Write down the names
of those who are going to come out.

704
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:43,041
Pablo Holgado,
Silvia Moreno,

705
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:44,641
Abraham Salmerón,

706
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:48,401
Ignasi Castell,
Magdalena Ribot,

707
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:52,521
Rocío Huertas,
Jessica Sánchez

708
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,641
and Alicia Villanueva.
What about Allison Parker?

709
00:55:56,441 --> 00:55:58,121
She's one of the Brighton girls.

710
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:00,281
I want you to put her on the list.

711
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:04,241
Well, I see you've noticed,
inspector.

712
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,401
You know as well as I do that Allison
is a queen of hearts

713
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:09,601
in this house of cards.
I can't.

714
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:11,521
It is an indispensable condition.

715
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:15,521
I'll propose something to you:

716
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:19,521
Allison.
in exchange for the lives of those eight.

717
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:20,601
I beg your pardon?

718
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:23,081
I will give you Allison Parker...

719
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:25,121
and no one else.

720
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:29,081
We both know
how important it is to both of us,

721
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:32,881
so if you want me to go out,
will go out alone.

722
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:38,121
I have to consult him.
You have one minute.

723
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:43,681
Call him and say yes,
that Parker comes out.

724
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:47,441
- I don't intend to make that decision.
It is immoral to choose one's life,

725
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:49,281
being able to save the eight.

726
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:52,001
As much as you and your ethics
think otherwise,

727
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:53,721
this is a matter of state...

728
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:58,121
and the first thing is going to be
to remove the ambassador's daughter.

729
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:02,521
I'll take responsibility.

730
00:57:09,081 --> 00:57:10,721
Get me the robber again.

731
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:19,521
Well?

732
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:23,201
Allison Parker.

733
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:28,801
Are you sure?

734
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:33,081
Would you rather save Allison's life
Parker to the eight-student?

735
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:35,561
Yeah, I'm sure.
Wow.

736
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:40,201
Now I have to think about it,
I didn't expect this answer from you.

737
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,681
Give me an hour to think about it.

738
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,401
All right.
I look forward to your call.

739
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:47,681
If I don't call her,

740
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:51,761
you will also know
what decision I've made.

741
00:57:57,481 --> 00:58:00,201
What did he mean by that?
- I don't know, but look:

742
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:04,161
Ibiza has been out of business for 10 years.
No insurance, no owners.

743
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,601
He's out of circulation.

744
00:58:05,721 --> 00:58:09,481
Attention everyone.
Come, please. Come closer.

745
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:14,801
What would you do if you had to do
disappear a car?

746
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:17,561
- Burn it.
- Good.

747
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:21,641
Look for crowds of burned cars,
and Guardia Civil. More.

748
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,001
- Sink it.

749
00:58:24,241 --> 00:58:28,481
- See if there's news of a car.
appeared in swamps, Ríos...

750
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:31,241
What else?
- Dismantle it, sell it by the piece.

751
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:34,521
- Bury him.
- I beg your pardon?

752
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,481
- A ditch is made
and the car is buried.

753
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:41,241
Eh... I saw it in a movie
and it worked.

754
00:58:42,761 --> 00:58:43,721
Anything else?

755
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:46,361
What's the legal way

756
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,441
to make a car disappear
and erase all his fingerprints?

757
00:58:51,681 --> 00:58:54,241
Make a junk bucket out of it.
in a junkyard.

758
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:59,001
Priority: search in scrapyards,
car cemeteries, and so on.

759
00:58:59,121 --> 00:59:01,041
- Raquel, it's Sunday,
will be closed.

760
00:59:01,161 --> 00:59:04,001
- I don't care. You take out the owner
of your home if necessary.

761
00:59:05,481 --> 00:59:06,441
Quickly!

762
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:39,681
Don't worry.

763
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:44,761
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

764
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:51,401
Here you will be more protected,
more isolated,

765
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,481
without knowing about things.
that afflict your soul.

766
00:59:55,601 --> 00:59:58,041
- I feel better now.
Can I go with the others?

767
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,441
- Can't you hear me?
You'd better stay here.

768
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:17,041
I'm gonna have to tie you up,

769
01:00:18,761 --> 01:00:21,961
because you'll be alone,
but you'll be better.

770
01:00:22,601 --> 01:00:24,801
Let's see, don't let him hurt you.
That's it.

771
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:30,161
Let's sit down.
You don't want to stand here?

772
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:36,681
Look how you've gotten...
Where have you been?

773
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:44,201
Let me go with the others, please.
- Take it easy!

774
01:00:51,841 --> 01:00:52,881
Don't you get it?

775
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,241
The ones who are afraid now...

776
01:00:59,681 --> 01:01:01,081
...it's them.

777
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:11,001
Girls, he's coming back.
He's coming back.

778
01:01:12,241 --> 01:01:13,881
I'm sure they'll bring her in now.

779
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:16,641
It's a girl, they won't do anything to her.

780
01:01:30,601 --> 01:01:31,721
And now, rest.

781
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:13,601
What are we going to do with so much pasta?
I've got it all figured out:

782
01:03:13,721 --> 01:03:17,921
I'm gonna get a Maserati.
colour blue clear sky.

783
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:28,521
It's this red car.
- How long has it been here?

784
01:04:29,841 --> 01:04:30,801
I don't know.

785
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:38,961
I don't know well,
Boss is on holiday and...

786
01:04:39,081 --> 01:04:40,041
- Oh, yeah?

787
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:46,121
Well, your boss said that you control
the entrance of all vehicles.

788
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:50,001
How long?

789
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:56,601
About 20 days.

790
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:01,281
Who brought it?
- Foreigner.

791
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:04,241
Eastern, not Russian.

792
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:08,521
Go get the gloves.
and call the scientist.

793
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:10,201
Tell them we have the car.

794
01:05:12,881 --> 01:05:16,521
I understand that whoever left you the car
showed him his documentation.

795
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:23,881
I'd give you an invoice for the purchase.

796
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:27,641
Ah!

797
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:32,601
Ticket.
- "Da, da". It can.

798
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:34,321
What do you mean, "can"?
- Ángel,

799
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:37,481
go to the office and look to see
If you find something, go.

800
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:38,801
- Yes. Pull.

801
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:54,001
Ah... Ah...

802
01:05:54,561 --> 01:05:56,921
Ah...! Ah!!

803
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:00,401
"...no statement
with regarding this filtration,

804
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:03,201
a conversation where the inspector
Raquel Murillo

805
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:06,401
negotiate with one of the
kidnappers, supposedly..."

806
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:14,321
Inspector.

807
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:34,601
Hey!

808
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:35,881
Hey!

809
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:39,201
Let's see who that is.
and what it's doing here.

810
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:43,081
"The inspector had taken the
left to a checkmate almost certainly.

811
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:45,601
But even at that moment
of despair,

812
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:47,961
the profesor had kept to himself
an extra ball

813
01:06:48,081 --> 01:06:50,481
that was starting to sound
on all radios."

814
01:06:50,601 --> 01:06:54,001
"The Opposition Spokesman
has described as regrettable

815
01:06:54,121 --> 01:06:56,401
that come first
diplomatic relations

816
01:06:56,521 --> 01:06:59,121
to life
of eight Spanish teenagers.

817
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:02,161
We remind you
the content of the recording."

818
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:07,281
Yes.
Tokio, listen to me.

819
01:07:07,401 --> 01:07:10,601
"He had ordered me to filter
the conversation with the inspector.

820
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:15,121
A conversation that left
in a very bad place to the Spanish Government

821
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:16,241
and herself."

822
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:18,241
"Well?
Allison Parker.

823
01:07:18,361 --> 01:07:19,321
Are you sure?

824
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:22,321
Do you prefer Allison Parker's life
instead of eight students?

825
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:23,761
Yes, I'm sure."

826
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:26,281
"Perhaps because Berlín
I had called him soft.

827
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:28,441
and had decided to give
a blow on the table

828
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:30,521
and punish
as many as went against him."

829
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:33,001
"The decision to liberate
to Allison Parker,

830
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:35,881
daughter of the ambassador,
in front of eight young Spaniards,

831
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:37,961
it's been a decision
controversial..."

832
01:07:38,081 --> 01:07:39,841
"Or simply that filtration

833
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:42,161
he'd introduce us again.
like heroes

834
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:43,921
in the eyes of the public,

835
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:46,761
but Raquel was a bloodhound..."

836
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:49,561
"...the daughter
of the British ambassador..."

837
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:52,081
"...and had caught a trail,

838
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:54,921
and I wasn't going to let it go,
because that trail

839
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:57,481
was the brain of the operation."
Stop!

840
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:01,361
"The Profesor himself."

841
01:08:03,281 --> 01:08:04,241
- Nothing.

842
01:08:22,441 --> 01:08:25,561
What are you doing here?
I wasn't stealing.

843
01:08:28,561 --> 01:08:29,521
I...

844
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:32,241
What the fuck does it smell like in here?
- Ammonia.

845
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:35,041
He wasn't stealing.

846
01:08:42,721 --> 01:08:46,081
"The profesor had become
in a human plunder to flee,

847
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:48,161
but a plus was missing
interpreting

848
01:08:48,281 --> 01:08:50,961
to get out of checkmate,
and then he did."

849
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:00,241
Get out.

850
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:42,241
It was him.

851
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,001
It was him!

852
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:12,921
There is a mole among us.

853
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:24,001
They've managed to isolate a footprint
on the Ibiza button.

854
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:34,161
Capricious, superficial,
selfish. You only know how to do harm.

855
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:43,201
Man take care man.

856
01:10:49,681 --> 01:10:51,561
You may be
the best of the Nazis,

857
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,561
but you're still one of them.

858
01:10:54,721 --> 01:10:57,241
Chief!

859
01:11:00,001 --> 01:11:02,081
What the fuck did he say to you?

860
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:20,881
Ah!

861
01:11:22,241 --> 01:11:23,521
Ah! No!
