00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,151
HUGHIE:
I know what you're gonna say,

162
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,153
but we just took out her chip.
Everything's fine.

163
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,489
Starlight, don't you
just light up a room, eh?

164
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,576
-You're looking well.
-STARLIGHT: Yeah, no thanks

165
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,036
to the .50-caliber round
that you pumped into my chest.

166
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,040
Well, what don't kill you
makes you stronger.

167
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,126
Hmm.

168
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,004
What's she doing here?

169
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,424
Uh, she has a lead
on Stormfront.

170
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,675
STARLIGHT:
I broke into her laptop,

171
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,968
and I got a look at the inbox.

172
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,345
Dozens of e-mails
from Stan Edgar.

173
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,140
Stan Edgar?

174
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,268
And what does Vought's
big slapper have to say?

175
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,895
How they're close
to a breakthrough

176
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,897
at the Sage Grove Center.

177
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,482
It's a psychiatric hospital
in Pennsylvania.

178
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,109
HUGHIE:
Wait, wh-what kind
of breakthrough?

179
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,403
She came in
before I could see any more.

180
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,198
Well, we better have us

181
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,617
a little dekko
at this loony bin, eh, lads?

182
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,952
Starlight,

183
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,163
would you be amenable
to joining us

184
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,165
on this little caper?

185

186
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,752
Oh, most definitely.

187
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,003
If shit goes sideways,

188
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,963
who do you think
Vought's gonna go after?

189
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,343
Us or their billion-dollar baby
turned traitor

190
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,929
who just ripped out
her own fucking chip?

191
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,058

291
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,464
You got a Supe
activated by rage,

292
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,840
so you simply take away
his rage,

293
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,258
turn him into a cupcake.

And your friends, too.
Maybe.

00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,317
Or... they go free.

318
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,403
But that depends on you.

320
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,031

646
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:30,592
-(shouting in French)
-Easy! Easy! Easy...

647
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,014
(yelling)

648
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,851
Easy... Come on, man.

649
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,936
(Frenchie pants)

650
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,983
(panting loudly)

651
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,868
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

652
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,369
And I don't want
to hear no bullshit

653
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,037
about I'm gonna getting tired
of the pussy.

654
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,873
I love this girl.

655
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,458
Like, this is the one.

656
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,835
Oh.

657
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,171
(laughs)

658
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,757
All right, brother.
All right.

659
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,425
-All right. All right.
-Congratulations, Marvin.

660
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,677
Thank you, Colonel.
Check it out.

661
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,471
-It's beautiful.
-(laughs)

662
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,098
Oh, the bachelor party
I will throw you.

663
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,185
What's your thoughts
about transgender strippers?

664
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,687
Strippers ain't really
my kind of Hershey's,

665
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,648
with or without nuts,
but you golf?

666
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,692
Thinking about doing
a golf trip.

667
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,570
Oi.

668
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,674
(chuckling)

669
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,301
(snorts)

670
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,053
(Butcher laughs)

671
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,638
(snorting)

672
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,307
(Mallory coughs)

673
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,893
-What?
-(quiet laughter)

674
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,062
And what the fuck
are you laughing at?

675
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,897
Sorry, mate.

676
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:10,067
You just look like one of them
poncy baton twirlers.

677
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,527
-A majorette.
-That's right.

678
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,779
A fucking majorette.

679
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,823
(Butcher laughs)

680
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,834
You look good in these.

681
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,213
So here's what happens now.

682
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,966
You're gonna tell us
every single thing

683
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,051
you see and hear at the Tower.

684
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,263
Especially when it comes
to Homelander.

685
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:43,559
(flame rumbling)

686
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,648
Please don't pretend
like you have a choice.

687
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,694
I look forward to your call.

688
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,792
-Easy peasy.
-(gun safety clicks)

689
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,335
MALLORY:
I don't like it.

690
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,921
You don't back an animal
like that into a corner.

691
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,840
Fuck him.

692
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,134
We own the cunt.

693
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,594
Frenchie?

694
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,556
Don't let him out of your sight.

695
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,600
<i>Oui, Madame.</i>

696
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,188
(birds singing)

697
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,404
Hey, what's the trouble, miss?

698
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,448
Sir, I need you
to get out of your car.

699
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,366
Well,
what are you talking about?

700
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,668
FBI.
Need to commandeer your vehicle.

701
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,337
-Bit of an emergency.
-Jesus.

702
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,380
-What happened to him?
-Long story, that.

703
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,258
-Uh, can I see some ID?
-Left it in me other pants.

704
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,678
Too busy saving this one,
but you can call my boss.

705
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,264
Yeah, okay. Uh, look, I'll...
I can get you... get you guys

706
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,266
to the hospital, but we're out
in the middle of nowhere.

707
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,726
I'm not gonna give you my car.

708
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,646
Have it your way.

709
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,273
Butcher?

710
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,691
(groans)

711
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,026
Butcher?

712
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,153
Don't.

713
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,866
(gun clicks)

714
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,660
-Stay back.
-Whoa! Okay.

715
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,495
-MAN: I said, stay back.
-That's not necessary.

716
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,996
-Let's just talk.
-The FBI?

717
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,498
Yeah, really.
You're not even American.

718
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,208
What, is-is he even hurt?

719
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,502
What is this?
Some kind of a scam?

720
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,756
If I wanted
to boost some wheels,

721
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,676
it wouldn't be a fuckin'
Hyundai, you daft cunt.

722
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,803
This is a stand-your-ground
state. You stay back!

723
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,263
Oh, you can stand
wherever the fuck you want.

724
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,641
-I'm taking your keys.
-Butcher, stop.

725
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,102
Buddy, just put the gun down.

726
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,354
-I said stay back.
-I said... put it down!

727
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,189
(soft click, car engine starts)

728
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,950
(Starlight sighs)

729
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,996
(sighs)

730
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,635
You couldn't just listen to me
and stay back?!

731
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,148
BUTCHER:
Come on.

732
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,191
Cauterize it!

733
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,319
(grunting)

734
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:46,867
(engine starts)

735
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,410
(Hughie moans)

736
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,787
(grunting)

737
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,668
It won't hold long.

738
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,670
Come on.

739
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,006
(Hughie grunting)

740
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,495
Is this the right time
to go shopping?

741
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,704
FRENCHIE:
One, why not?

742
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,499
And <i>deux...</i>

743
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,375
this is good news.

744
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,419
What do you mean by that?

745
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,800
Some aerated propofol...

746
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:48,512
some other odds and ends,
I'll make a knockout bomb.

747
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,639
Even for Supes.

748
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,434
MOTHER'S MILK:
Okay.

749
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,235
Why are we still alive?

750
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:07,197
-Dumb luck?
-FRENCHIE: No.

751
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,824
I mean that night.

752
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,284
We went underground for months.

753
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,956
But you never came for us.

754
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,083
Not you, not Homelander.

755
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,501
Why?

756
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,628
You're disappointed
we didn't kill you?

757
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,840
I thought The Seven
always retaliates, no?

758
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,800
You're nobody.

759
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,468
Not worth it.

760
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,603
You didn't tell them, did you?

761
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,234
Why wouldn't you tell them?

762
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,652
Who says I didn't?

763
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,737
I figured you'd boast about it

764
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,407
to Homelander,
must've been thrilling for you.

765
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,325
I'm not a fucking animal.

766
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,120
FRENCHIE:
Only a fucking animal
would do what you did.

767
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,538
Drop it.

768
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,957
-You murdered innocent children.
-Shut the fuck up.

769
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,501
You watched them burn alive,
crying for their mama.

770
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,421
If that's not an animal,
then what is, huh?

771
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,423
I didn't know!

772
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,598
I didn't know they were
gonna be in that bed.

773
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,309
It was supposed to be your boss.

774
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,944
Then they started screaming.

775
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,412
But it was too late.

776
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,209
So what, are we supposed
to feel bad for you now?

777
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,835
Fuck you.

778
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,462
LAMPLIGHTER:
I don't want anything from you.

779
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,796
But you...

780
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,884
I saw you following me
that night.

781
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:56,223
And then you disappeared.

782
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,309
I keep asking myself, why...

783
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,479
why didn't you stop me?

784
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,946
Why didn't you?

785
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,406
Good question.

786
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,454
(crowd cheering, clamoring)

787
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,087
All right, all right.

788
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,679
(phone buzzing)

789
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,474
Cherie, this is not--

790
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,892
<i>CHERIE:
He's dying!</i>

791
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,936
<i>-Quoi?
-Jay!</i>

792
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,020
He's ODing.

793
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,689
I-I don't know what he took.

794
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,065
-Take him to the hospital!
<i>-Please, come now!</i>

795
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,817
<i>Come!</i>

796
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,197
Serge, you fucking come
right now.

797
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,033
Cherie!

798
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,077
Hello--

799
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,871
(smacks lips, mutters)

800
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,341
CHERIE:
No.

801
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,551
FRENCHIE:
Come on!

802
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,595
Come on, <i>mon ami!</i>

803
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,393
-(gasps)
-Oh!

804
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,312
Look at me, look at me,
you went out.

805
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,896
Okay, can you sit?

806
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,356
Come on!

807
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,941
Come on, <i>mon ami, </i>come on.

808
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,320
He's okay.

-You keep him talking, okay?
-What?

811

Where are you going?

812
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,536
Don't let him fall asleep.

813
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,038
-What...?
-I told you I have something.

814
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,456
Something more important
than this?

815
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,707
More important than <i>us?</i>

816
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,792
Cherie, I cannot
do this right now.

817
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,253

818
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,381

827

what you done back there.

everything to me.

830
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,594

to stick the landing.

831
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:40,678
Nice one.

832
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,724
You didn't have a choice.

833
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,272
You know what I was thinking,
when I was looking at him?

834
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:57,278
"Why'd you pull a gun,
you stupid fuck?"

835
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,697
That's all.

836
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,578
Maybe once I would've
cried over him, but...

837
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,249
now he was just another
person in our way.

838
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,840
No.

839
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,758
-No what?
-No to that

840
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,429
fucking look of quiet respect

841
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,389
or approval or whatever that is.

842
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,599
I don't want it.

843
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,729
We're nothing alike.

844
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,773
Nothing.

845
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,783
(machinery whirring)

846
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,082
You really think
that's gonna work?

847
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,460
I think so.

848
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:04,721
You know, they're not
trying to make Supes here.

849
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,598
These people are test subjects.

850
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,266
They're trying
to stabilize the V.

851
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,642
Explain.

852
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,187
Infants handle it best,
but adults?

853
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,189
I mean, you saw what happens--
sometimes you get powers,

854
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,816
sometimes you get a freak,
sometimes you just explode.

855
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,319
Vought is trying
to stabilize it,

856
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,571
so that you put the V
in any adult arm,

857
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,782
anywhere, anytime, you get
a solid Supe, solid powers.

<i>Putain.</i>

859
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,621
Okay, so...

860
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,790
a thousand more Supes...
100,000?

861
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,709
Why? Why would Vought do that?

862
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,503
It's gonna fuck up their movies,
their merchandising...

863
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,838
They don't tell me.

864
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,342
They just make me
burn the evidence.

865

870
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,328
Why I didn't stop you.

871
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,455
You were at a party.

872
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,958
I was away for 30 minutes.

873
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,919
Came back, you were gone.

874
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,800

875
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,843

877
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:34,102

and...

878
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,521
then, uh, he died
a few months later.

879
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,147
Another overdose.

880

<i>(passengers screaming)</i>

974
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,695
I'm gonna show that
to Homelander.

975
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,990
And...

976
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:05,993
he's either gonna leave us alone

977
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,287
or I'm gonna put it on CNN.

978
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,253
Elena.

979
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,631
This is our out.

980
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,470
I was scared. I...

981
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,434
I know
I should have stood up to him.

982
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,019
I know that.

983
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:36,065
Elena, I watched
a plane full of people die.

984
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,449
Why are you looking at me
like that?

985
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,118
(exhales)

986
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,869
(birds chirping)

987
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,122
Yeah. Right.

988
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,206
Yo.

989
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,417
Close stitch, but Hughie's okay.

990
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,584
Oh, <i>bien.</i>

991
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,169
Hey,

992
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,755
tell Butcher about the thick
penis around your neck.

993
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,173
(whispers):
Fuck you.

994
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,843
Nah, nah, nah, it's just
Frenchie being Frenchie.

995
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,522
I am sorry.

996
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,903
For a long time,

997
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:26,866
I was trying to save you.

998
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,702
I thought, uh,

999
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,454
if I did, somehow,

1000
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:35,791
that would make up
for the things I've done.

1001
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:41,130
You never asked to be saved.

1002
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:47,303
You cannot absolve my, uh, sins.

1003
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,389
(exhales)
No one can.

1004
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,142
I know this now.

1005
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:56,353
So...

1006
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,314
I leave you alone.

1007
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,944
(vehicle approaching)

1008
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,082
Got to go.

1009
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,879

00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,798

1011
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,384
MOTHER'S MILK:
Colonel.

1012
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,886
Marvin,

1013
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,138
where is he?

1014
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,182
This way.

1015
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,104
Madame Mallory.

1016
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,107
Uh, I know I wasn't welcome
at the funeral,

1017
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,318
so, all these years, I
couldn't offer my condolences...

1018
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,403
Where is he?

1019
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,204
(exhales)
Why isn't this man restrained?

1020
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:56,622
No need. I wanted to come.

1021
00:56:56,664 --> 00:57:00,209
I don't want to hear
a single goddamn word from you.

1022
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,297
(breathing heavily)

1023
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,882
(whispering):
I thought this was behind me.

1024
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,926
But it's not.

1025
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,180
It never is.
(crying)

1026
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,975
Then let's both be done with it.

1027
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:18,978
(shuddering)

1028
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,605
I know what you have to do.

1029
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,860
Do it.

1030
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,862
You'd be doing me a favor.

1031
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,321
Do it.

1032
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,159
Madame, please.

1033
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,619
If I may?

1034
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,247
Besides you,

1035
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,332
no one wanted him dead more
than me,

1036
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,585
but I am begging you
for his life.

1037
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,677
I have no choice.

1038
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,848
It won't help you.

1039
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,560
All you'd be doing
is ending his torment.

1040
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,984
You cannot punish him
as much as he punishes himself.

1041
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,031
Trust me.

1042
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,286
So...

1043
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,707
...what exactly

1044
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:25,252
are you proposing we do
with him?

1045
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,261
Hey.

1046
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,389
I'm so glad you're here.

1047
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,807
I want to apologize.

1048
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,309
Please, just let me explain.

1049
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:44,855
Flap, flap, flap
goes that little mouth of yours.

1050
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,694
You remember you told me
that you don't break easily?

1051
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,782
Well, I've been thinking
about that.

1052
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,161
A lot.

1053
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,165
I will never lie to you again.

1054
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,918
I will tell you everything.

1055
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:09,255
(exhales)

1056
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,385
Starting with this.

1057
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,243
Your grandmother?

1058
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,830
My daughter.

1059
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,628
Chloe. She died of Alzheimer's
a few years ago.

1060
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,507
How old are you?

1061
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,593
I was born in 1919.

1062
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,137
In Berlin.

1063
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,526
Is that you with...?

1064
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,528
Heinrich Himmler.

1065
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,447
He was a lovely dancer.

1066
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,824
And that's Goebbels.

1067
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,576
And...

1068
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,954
the most important man
in the room...

1069
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,634
Frederick Vought.

1070
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:44,016
He gave me the first successful
V injection.

1071
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,227
He taught me everything.

1072
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:49,980
And then we fell in love,

1073
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,315
and he gave me a daughter.

1074
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,942
He made me,

1075
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,404
and his genius made you.

1076
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,584
Frederick didn't care
about all the fans or stardom

1077
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:13,587
or any of that shallow bullshit.

1078
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:17,508
We are in a war for the culture.

1079
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,511
The other races
are grinding us down

1080
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,346
and taking
what is rightfully ours,

1081
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,765
but we can fight back.
(exhales)

1082
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:26,934
With an army of supermen,

1083
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,269
millions strong.

1084
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:33,023
Because that is
Vought's true destiny.

1085
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:37,903
And <i>you </i>will be the man
who will lead us.

1086
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:47,454
You are everything
that we dreamed of.

1087
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:53,919
So I love you
with all of my heart.

1088
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:57,673
How could I not?

1089
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:06,640
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

1090
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:09,435
And then I found you.

1091
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,980
We found each other.

1092
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,358
And now neither of us

1093
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,777
has to be alone ever again.

1094
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,281
And that...

1095
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,908
is the truth.
