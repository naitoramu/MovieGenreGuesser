1
00:00:01,137 --> 00:00:02,798
This season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:05,504
The only way I know
how to fight the darkness

3
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:07,103
is to be darkness,

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:09,794
and I don't want to be
that type of person anymore.

5
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:10,674
I'm running for mayor.

6
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:11,907
And I promise you

7
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,175
that I will never
stop fighting

8
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:14,710
to save this city.

9
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:15,945
You're all fretting
about this city dying.

10
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:17,213
I'm here on behalf
of an organization

11
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:19,348
that wants you
to let it die.

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,483
I'm Damien Darhk.

13
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:23,385
The type of magic
he's using,

14
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:24,753
I've seen it take
good people

15
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:26,121
and turn them dark.

16
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:27,590
If I don't
make it off this island,

17
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:30,426
you will go to Russia
and find my parents.

18
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,761
If Darhk wins,
Laurel died for nothing.

19
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:35,931
If you can channel
light and hope,

20
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,101
you will be able
to repel Darhk's magic.

21
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:40,769
Do you remember
what I promised you?

22
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,971
A new beginning.

23
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:43,339
Darhk plans
to burn the world

24
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:45,174
in a nuclear fire.

25
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:46,909
I'm assuming you know
what Rubicon is.

26
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,978
And I'm assuming it's
under Mr. Darhk's control.

27
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,412
Every NATO Ally--

28
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:52,414
Rubicon has control over
all their nuclear systems.

29
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,682
You mean
HIVE does.

30
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:55,150
If even one
of those nukes hits...

31
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:56,485
He will be
unstoppable.

32
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:57,953
- I think it worked.
- It worked.

33
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:01,023
Rubicon's offline.
Ha ha ha!

34
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,725
Do you need a moment?

35
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:03,959
No? Good.

36
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:05,227
Because I need you
to do me a favor.

37
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:06,662
Go to hell.

38
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:09,331
Why bother?

39
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,167
I'm going to bring it to us.

40
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:15,137
Get the hell
out of here.

41
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,739
Mom, stop.

42
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:19,341
- Oh, my God!
- Mom, get back!

43
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:20,576
This is your mother?

44
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,945
Oh, goodie.

45
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:25,648
Persuading you to help me

46
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,882
is going to be easier
than I thought.

47
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:28,384
Helping you
do what?

48
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:29,685
Your underground city's
already been destroyed.

49
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:30,886
I'm still going forward.

50
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:32,187
So, what,
you kill my mother

51
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,455
if I don't help you
destroy the world?

52
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:35,691
Newsflash--my mother
lives in the world.

53
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,554
Dying instantaneously
in nuclear fire,

54
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,855
rather painless,

55
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,724
and then there's
having your life force

56
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,027
slowly sucked out
like this.

57
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:47,496
Mom!

58
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:50,132
What's it going to be,
miss Smoak?

59
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,240
Look. I know you don't
live here anymore,

60
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,743
but those were
nice windows.

61
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,245
So unoriginal.

62
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:06,081
I am now powered
by the deaths

63
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,517
of tens of thousands
of souls.

64
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,687
There is nothing
you can do to stop me...

65
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:15,524
Or should I say, "us."

66
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,955
Stop!

67
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,391
You let them go,

68
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:52,561
or I kill
your daughter.

69
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,698
Do you think
I'm bluffing?

70
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,769
Let my daughter go.

71
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,272
It's ok, sweetheart.

72
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:05,908
Everything's going
to be all right.

73
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:12,915
Are you ok?

74
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,783
When did this
become your life?

75
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,585
Oh, my God!

76
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,557
Oh, my God,
it's gone.

77
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,250
He took it.
It's gone.

78
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:22,833
What's gone?

79
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,100
The laptop with
the anti-Rubicon program.

80
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:25,701
If Darhk has that...

81
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,970
He can launch all of the world's
nuclear missiles.

82
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:31,994

Looks like
internal bleeding.

85
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,353
Possibly broken ribs.

86
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:46,556
Hemothorax.

87
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,792
We have to relieve
the pressure. Thea.

88
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,461
Felicity, we need you
at your station.

89
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:54,598
We have to stop Rubicon.

90
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,167
Is he going to be ok?

91
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,105
Put the gun down,
Reiter.

92
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:03,340
Aah!

93
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,608
Oh!

94
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,309
You think you can kill me,
miss Venediktov?

95
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,844
I am going to kill you.

96
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:09,880
You'll only kill
yourself in the attempt.

97
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,416
Without these runes,

98
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,118
the idol's power would
overwhelm my mind.

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,353
I don't care.

100
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:18,522
It's worth it to stop you.

101
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,756
See that, Reiter?

102
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,359
That plane filled
with all those people

103
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,027
you were keeping
prisoner?

104
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,962
They're getting away.
This is over!

105
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,998
That's not all of them,
Mr. Queen.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,866
The plane's too small.

107
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,302
And it's not over.

108
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,171
Ohh!

109
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,006
All those deaths,

110
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,641
they give me power,

111
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:41,344
and her...Only madness.

112
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:43,046
Aah!

113
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,849
How is he?

114
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,284
Well, he's stable.

115
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,552
John said the next 30 minutes
should tell us...

116
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,853
Whether or not
he'll make it?

117
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,054
Yeah.

118
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,322
Hey, can I ask you
something?

119
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,790
I know it might not
be the best time.

120
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,225
Back at our place--
my place--

121
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:56,860
the--the place--
the loft...

122
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,061
Yeah.

123
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,763
Darhk's magic,
it worked on you.

124
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:00,997
I thought--

125
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,232
you thought I found
a way to stop it.

126
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:05,202
That was before
he grew so powerful.

127
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,837
It was the--

128
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,674
the hope you had in me
was able to counteract his magic.

129
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:14,144
And now my hope's
not enough.

130
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,147
So where are we?

131
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,882
Um, good news,
bad news time.

132
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:22,853
Good news is is that Darhk hasn't
launched the nukes yet.

133
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,221
I think his hacker's
still trying

134
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,455
to break our failsafes.

135
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:26,857
Ok, and the bad news?

136
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,258
Well, the bad news is
that with Rubicon offline,

137
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,559
there is nothing
for me to hack into.

138
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,361
Right, but your laptop
has to have a GPS--

139
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,762
- yeah.
- I'm sure that you've already

140
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:34,030
started to try and do it.

141
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:36,233
Yeah.

142
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,701
I thought you'd
shut Rubicon down.

143
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,936
Felicity is working
on locating the laptop.

144
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,204
Where's Sara?

145
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,439
She's fine.

146
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:45,242
She's in an Argus bunker
in Coast City.

147
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,510
With Darhk's anti-nuke
bunker destroyed,

148
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,612
why is he moving
forward with Genesis?

149
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,913
Machin killed his wife.

150
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,214
Well, his daughter still
lives in this world.

151
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,449
He must know that.

152
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,284
He knows, he just--
he doesn't care.

153
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,552
He's lost all hope.

154
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:56,786
Yeah, just like
all of us.

155
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:58,388
Wait. I thought he
was the cynic.

156
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,423
It's not like John doesn't have
a point, Thea.

157
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,125
We are not finished yet.

158
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,426
The key word
being "yet."

159
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:04,694
I got a 20
on the laptop.

160
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,062
Downtown, abandoned
office building.

161
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,931
Let's move.

162
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,743
Overwatch,
there's no one here.

163
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:20,977
That's impossible.

164
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,279
You're right on top
of the GPS signal.

165
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,620
She's right.

166
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:40,030
Oh, my God.

167
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,532
Overwatch.

168
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:43,767
I see it.

169
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,268
Just over 15,000
ballistic missiles,

170
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,603
and they all just launched.

171
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:47,837
How much time do we have?

172
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,105
Two hours.

173
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,341
Maybe less.

174
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:03,214
Confirmed.
15,434 birds in the air.

175
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:04,893
We need to set
defense condition one

176
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,563
and get the president
down to the PEOC.

177
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:08,241
Felicity.

178
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:09,508
He's got me
completely locked out.

179
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,743
Ok, how many
missiles are there?

180
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:12,010
DOD's
working on it,

181
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:13,245
but the targets
are worldwide.

182
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,546
You said that we
have two hours.

183
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:15,748
The world has two hours,

184
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,015
but I'm tracking
a Minuteman ICBM

185
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,684
heading straight
for Star City.

186
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:19,985
It just launched out
of Warren Air Force Base in Colorado.

187
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:21,220
Ok, well, that's close.

188
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,388
Which means we only
have 45 minutes.

189
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,250
Taiana.

190
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:52,484
I'm ok.

191
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:56,355
I think...I'm ok.

192
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:57,823
Taiana?

193
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:00,926
All right,
where's the fire?

194
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:03,595
What's this?

195
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:04,863
The safest place
within 100 miles

196
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,131
to survive a nuclear attack.

197
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,332
Based on wind patterns--

198
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

199
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:09,835
What are you
talking about?

200
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,303
The world is going
to end in two hours.

201
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:13,105
I need you to take
my mother there.

202
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,339
Can you do that?

203
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,642
Yeah, I will.

204
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,782
Sara, on phone:
Bye, daddy. Bye, mama.

205
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:25,150
We'll see you
soon, sweetie.

206
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:26,685
I love you, baby girl.

207
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,492
Argus has a chopper waiting
to take us to Coast City,

208
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:37,062
so at least we'll
all be together.

209
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:39,965
If we can't stop the...

210
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,700
The end of the world.

211
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:44,169
In these situations,

212
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,506
you're usually the one
offering hope.

213
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:48,974
I'm fresh out, Lyla.

214
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,976
Because of what
happened with Andy?

215
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:52,845
It was self-defense, John.

216
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:55,514
It was a clean kill.

217
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:57,182
Lyla.

218
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:59,151
Are you having Argus
move on city hall?

219
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:01,687
John told me the source
of Darhk's power is there,

220
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,555
that he might be looking
to harness the deaths

221
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:04,790
from the nuclear attacks.

222
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,058
No, he's already
done that

223
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,292
with the first attack.

224
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:09,061
He will decimate
your team.

225
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:10,529
You should
pull them back.

226
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,797
And what if his hacker's
down there with him?

227
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,165
Cooper Seldon is not
going to be anywhere

228
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,366
that we think to look.

229
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:15,634
He'll be in a secure
location.

230
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:18,503
If your team
goes down there,

231
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:19,705
they will all die.

232
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:21,106
It's not your call,
Oliver.

233
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:23,408
It's mine.

234
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,785
I don't like
this place.

235
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,054
It's scary.

236
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,990
Hey...

237
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:42,027
It's just a little bit
longer, sweetheart.

238
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,429
I miss mommy.

239
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:50,936
I do, too.

240
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:55,240
But we're going
to see her soon.

241
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,390
Assault team sledgehammer

242
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:12,591
has engaged target.

243
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,593
Switching you
to their feed now.

244
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:33,312
Turn it off.

245
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,253
Those missiles hit,

246
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:42,821
and he's going to become
even stronger, isn't he?

247
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:45,190
He already is with the souls
of all of those Argus agents

248
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,458
that he just killed.

249
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,260
Wait.

250
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,527
I'm in. I'm through
Cooper's firewalls.

251
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,762
Well, shut it down.

252
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:51,630
That's what
I'm trying to--

253
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,126
Aah!

254
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:26,598
Look at me.
Listen to me.

255
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,501
Don't let it
control your mind.

256
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:33,872
Yaah!

257
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:36,241
You are a murderer.

258
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:38,243
You killed my brother.

259
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,779
You are darkness.

260
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,081
Yes...I am...

261
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,885
But you--you don't
have to be.

262
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:51,957
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,192
It's ok.

264
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:56,128
I can feel it
burning my mind.

265
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,964
Taiana, we will find a way

266
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,166
to work around this.

267
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:04,770
There is only one way.

268
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:11,877
You have to kill me,
Oliver.

269
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,746
With Mayor Adams
missing and presumed dead,

270
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:16,982
Deputy Mayor Remz
called for calm

271
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,884
in the wake
of unconfirmed reports

272
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:22,287
that a nuclear attack
on our city is imminent.

273
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:24,122
Newly assigned police captain
Frank Pike asks...

274
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:26,458
Just when things
couldn't get any worse.

275
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,926
Is everyone all right?

276
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,127
I think "all right"
is a relative term.

277
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:30,495
How much time
do we have?

278
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:31,730
I think 27 minutes.

279
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:33,599
It's kind of hard
to tell now.

280
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,236
I wonder what Laurel would
have thought of all this.

281
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,737
Well, she probably would
have said something

282
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:42,507
about finding a solution
no matter what.

283
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:46,278
Yeah. She's always
stubborn like that.

284
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,313
Too bad she would have
been wrong this time.

285
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,514
Hey, come on.

286
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:51,483
We can't just lose
all hope here.

287
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:53,018
You have.

288
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:58,156
I can see it
in your eyes.

289
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:02,661
I just can't believe
that I thought

290
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:05,464
that I'd be the one
to unite this city

291
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:09,368
while Damien Darhk
was trying to kill it.

292
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,470
That was arrogant.

293
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:12,871
It was the same arrogance

294
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:15,641
that made me feel like
I could be the Green Arrow

295
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,509
without descending
into darkness.

296
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,745
Bottom line,
it was foolish.

297
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:21,013
You don't believe that.

298
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:23,348
I didn't believe that...

299
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,983
Until Laurel died.

300
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:26,251
I thought you weren't
blaming yourself

301
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:27,519
for her death anymore.

302
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:31,390
We made a decision
to come back here.

303
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,392
I tried to do things
differently,

304
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:36,328
and for a time, I did.

305
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:46,071
And now I am left here
to wonder if I hadn't,

306
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:49,574
would Laurel
still be alive?

307
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:52,944
Curtis.

308
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,212
You shouldn't be up.

309
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:56,581
Tell me about it.

310
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,217
Someone's got to provide
a little optimism.

311
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:01,853
Doesn't seem like
anyone around here

312
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:03,088
is in the head-space
to do it.

313
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,790
Then you know we've
lost the city.

314
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,858
No.

315
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,295
I know that you're running
out of time to get it back.

316
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:12,130
Look.

317
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:13,699
Living in Star City

318
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,601
requires a special
kind of tenacity.

319
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:19,438
A sane person
wouldn't live here.

320
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,208
It's a fact that Paul likes
to remind me of weekly.

321
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,545
We were this close
to leaving Star City last October.

322
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:31,350
After 3 terrorist attacks,
we were done,

323
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:36,388
but then the night
before we were going to start packing,

324
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,691
the Green Arrow
popped up on our TV,

325
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,827
and he reminded me
that this city

326
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:43,929
is worth saving,

327
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:46,365
that my home--

328
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:51,236
that my home was
worth fighting for.

329
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,775
That guy gave me
inspiration.

330
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:59,378
He gave me hope.

331
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,147
And if he could
give me hope then,

332
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:06,651
why can't he give it
to others now?

333
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:18,663
Hey, stop!

334
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:22,100
Stop!

335
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:24,302
Please.

336
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:27,139
I know what you're
feeling right now.

337
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:30,308
I'm feeling it, too,

338
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,778
the sense of--
of helplessness,

339
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,247
of hopelessness.

340
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:39,317
I don't know
how we even begin

341
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,121
to process what might
happen to us right now,

342
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:46,425
but there are a few things
that I do know.

343
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:49,394
I know that this city
has been through

344
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:51,029
tough times before,

345
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:53,598
and we have pulled
through.

346
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,035
We survived
the Undertaking.

347
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:59,471
We survived the Siege.

348
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:01,173
We survived
the Outbreak,

349
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:04,342
and somehow, someway,

350
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,412
we will survive this.

351
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:09,314
A friend of mine told me

352
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:12,284
that living in Star City,

353
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:15,353
it takes a special kind
of tenacity,

354
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:19,491
but we do live here,

355
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:22,861
because this is our home.

356
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:26,965
This is our home!

357
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:31,503
It is our friend,
our family, our lives,

358
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:34,172
and we will not--
we will not

359
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:37,175
throw those precious
gifts away

360
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:40,378
by descending into chaos.

361
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,482
We will look
to each other for hope.

362
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:46,451
We will cling to each other
for strength,

363
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:48,553
and if we do that,

364
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,689
no matter what happens,

365
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:55,927
then we can all
stand here united.

366
00:17:57,798 --> 00:17:59,698
Oh, my God. It's here.

367
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,533
That's terrifying...

368
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:03,335
And also kind of great.

369
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:04,870
I think you got hit
on the head harder

370
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:06,371
than you realize.

371
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:07,873
No, no, he's right.
I can't hack this system.

372
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,407
But if the nuke
gets close enough, which it is...

373
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:11,042
We could use
the line-of-sight attack

374
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:13,712
on the missile itself
and disarm it.

375
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,280
Still not getting a signal.

376
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:16,548
Are you sure you're pointing
that thing at the nuke?

377
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,782
It's pretty hard
to miss, Felicity.

378
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,217
Ok, ok, ok.
I'm just going--oh!

379
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,785
Whatever you changed,
don't change it again.

380
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,087
It's working.
I got a signal.

381
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,288
I didn't change anything!

382
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,556
Nukes are designed
to detonate

383
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:25,891
100 feet above
their actual target.

384
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,225
I'm uploading a GPS
spoof to disable it.

385
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:28,593
Great...

386
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:31,096
But, um, it's still
heading straight for us.

387
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,231
Just keep pointing
the IR receiver at the thingy.

388
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,200
You know, I have
perfect confidence in your abilities.

389
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:36,434
- Thank you.
- But just in case,

390
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,869
working with you
and the rest of the team

391
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:39,137
has been the highlight
of my professional career

392
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,472
and my entire life,

393
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,773
and--and I can't think
of any better way

394
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:42,974
for it to end than--

395
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,242
Curtis,
as sweet as this is,

396
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:47,078
the talking's
really not helping.

397
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,087
Oh, my God.

398
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:58,590
Oh, my God,
it worked! Ohh!

399
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:17,679
Whatever you guys just
did was incredible.

400
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:19,612
We only took down
one nuke.

401
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:23,683
We still have 15,433
to go, give or take.

402
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,251
The code to
the line-of-sight hack,

403
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:26,519
can you distro
it to everybody?

404
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:27,787
I'm on it.

405
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,021
All right, that's one.

406
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:30,256
1 nuke in 15,000.

407
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:31,524
The chances of us
getting them all is--

408
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:32,759
1 in 375 million.

409
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:33,993
Well, we need to find
Darhk's hacker

410
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:35,294
and shut down Rubicon
at the source.

411
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:36,529
When we disarmed
the nuke,

412
00:19:36,531 --> 00:19:37,930
we gained access
to its onboard computer

413
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,332
and cloned
its hard drive remotely.

414
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,767
Then we ran a back trace
to determine the source

415
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,034
of the initial
launch signal.

416
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:43,302
He's holed up
in a warehouse

417
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:44,804
on the corner
of Cheswold and Crombie.

418
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:46,005
Let's get after him.

419
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:47,273
That was quite
a speech, Oliver.

420
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:48,741
It made me long
for a voting booth.

421
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:50,777
You and Thea need
to back up Curtis and Felicity

422
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,011
while they deal
with Seldon.

423
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,312
Hey, what are you
going to do?

424
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:54,514
I'm going to city hall.

425
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:55,782
Oliver, you
yourself said

426
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,150
going after Darhk
is a suicide mission.

427
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,718
Well, John, I'm not
going to die tonight.

428
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,319
Well, let me go
with you, back you up.

429
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:01,521
If things go bad,

430
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:02,822
I need you
to back the city up.

431
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,258
Oliver, things aren't
going to go bad.

432
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,727
Your speech...

433
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,463
Inspired all of us, too.

434
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,735
Let's move.

435
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:17,370
Do it, Oliver.

436
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:19,238
Please, do it quickly.

437
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,740
Taiana.

438
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:22,041
I'm not going
to kill you--

439
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,276
Then I will kill you.

440
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,911
Don't you understand?

441
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,245
Please!

442
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:29,382
Before I kill whoever
is left on this island,

443
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:33,186
before I become worse
than Reiter, please.

444
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:36,189
Please don't ask
me to do this.

445
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:38,257
If you ever
cared for me,

446
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,094
then you would do this.

447
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:52,471
Don't forget
your promise.

448
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:55,074
I won't.

449
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:03,983
Taiana, I'm sorry.

450
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:07,753
It's ok, it's ok.

451
00:21:15,496 --> 00:21:17,897
You killed her!

452
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:26,205
I thought you were
staying behind.

453
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:30,276
Yeah, it doesn't mean
I shouldn't be prepared.

454
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:33,546
I'm not going to ask
if you're all right.

455
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:35,715
I think I know
the answer.

456
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:37,717
Lyla, this isn't the right
time for this conversation.

457
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,920
When the Ghosts
attacked, you froze.

458
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,588
I've never seen you
do that before.

459
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,257
Lyla, I can't talk
about this.

460
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,458
Was it Andy?

461
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,326
- He was a Ghost.
- Lyla.

462
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:48,594
If the world's
going to end,

463
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:51,063
then let's
at least go out

464
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:52,632
being honest
with each other.

465
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:55,434
Yes, it was Andy.

466
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:01,307
But not like I said

467
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,710
and not like you think.

468
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:10,016
Earlier you said
it was a good kill.

469
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,453
It wasn't, Lyla.

470
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,124
I said it was
self-defense.

471
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:20,626
It wasn't.

472
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,830
You must think
I'm a monster.

473
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:28,768
Fog of war, Johnny.

474
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:34,840
You did what
you had to do.

475
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:37,877
It's that simple.

476
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:41,747
Lyla, there's nothing
simple about this.

477
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:46,719
Darhk!

478
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,354
What does a guy
have to do

479
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,556
to end the world
in peace?

480
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,124
Why is he here, Daddy?

481
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:54,894
Oh, he came here
to die, sweetheart.

482
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,896
Clearly.

483
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:10,425
Ha ha ha!

484
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:12,625
15 minutes till
the end of the world,

485
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,692
and you want
to spend them with me.

486
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,361
I am touched.

487
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,337
Yeah, it looks like
the hacker's here.

488
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:41,219
Thanks, unless you
were aiming at me.

489
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:43,654
At this point,
I honestly can't tell.

490
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,226
Even if you stop me,
even if you could,

491
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:51,796
those missiles are
finding their targets.

492
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:58,069
This is a mercy killing
on a global scale.

493
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,304
I'm sparing my daughter
the pain of growing up

494
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,607
without her mother.

495
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,411
Or Mr. Lance living
without Laurel.

496
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,815
And don't get me
started on your pain.

497
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,483
Let him go!

498
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,988
Get out.

499
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,222
For real?

500
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,457
- Get out of here.
- Get out!

501
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,158
Get out
of our town!

502
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,760
We don't want you here!

503
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,096
Get out of this town!

504
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,932
"Get out." Heh heh heh.

505
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,440
This heartwarming display

506
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,742
would mean
a whole lot more

507
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,143
had I not just
seen you all

508
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,980
tearing yourselves
and your city apart.

509
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,348
Aah!

510
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,854
That is why I did this.

511
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,856
Humanity is feckless,

512
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,124
and I wanted
to cleanse it

513
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:55,493
of a millennia
worth of rot

514
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,495
it has been infected by,

515
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,030
and I will do it!

516
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:01,632
No, you won't.

517
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,470
Ok, just for fun,

518
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:09,006
how are you going
to stop me?

519
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:14,278
Because it won't just be me
who's going to stop you.

520
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:43,341
It's not so easy
without the magic, is it?

521
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:45,977
Oh, I don't need magic.

522
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:49,347
I'm a former member
of the League of Assassins,

523
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,515
or have you
forgotten that?

524
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,284
Remind me.

525
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,939
Oh, my God.

526
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,207
Cooper.

527
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,975
Hey, Felicity.

528
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,243
How you doing?

529
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,478
Who shot you?

530
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,746
Guess.

531
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:22,947
He's moving the bullet

532
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,915
closer and closer
to my spine.

533
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,117
I said it hurt so bad,

534
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,451
I'd do anything
to make him stop.

535
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,686
Like blow up the planet?

536
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:31,222
Sorry, I'm
a selfish bastard,

537
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:32,857
but she knew that
already.

538
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,759
I need a moment
alone with him.

539
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,060
Felicity, I don't
think right--

540
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,928
Now.

541
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:40,965
I'm sorry, Felicity.

542
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,800
I know I should be
strong enough

543
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,103
to pull myself away
from this keyboard,

544
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,606
but I think we both
know that I'm not.

545
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,474
You are.

546
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,676
He's powerful.

547
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,745
He's so powerful,

548
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:57,581
and if I stop Rubicon,
he'll know,

549
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:01,452
and he'll kill me
in the most painful way possible.

550
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:04,188
You're better
than this, Cooper.

551
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,424
You're stronger than this.

552
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:09,160
You can still do
the right thing.

553
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:12,897
You can still be
the man that I loved.

554
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:15,833
I haven't been that guy
in a long time.

555
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,568
Remember what we wanted
to do 7 years ago

556
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,071
in that cockroach-infested
dorm room?

557
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:24,442
Save the world.

558
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:26,877
Now's your chance.

559
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:50,034
Mr. Seldon,
you weak-willed dust mite.

560
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,511
I'm sorry, Cooper.

561
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,671
Oh.

562
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,039
You brought friends.

563
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,041
That's ok.

564
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,844
So did I.

565
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:52,626
What the hell
happened?

566
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:53,960
Darhk.

567
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:55,568
We have 3 minutes
to take down 15,000 nukes.

568
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,835
Why isn't this
a simple matter

569
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:57,892
of flicking off a switch?

570
00:28:57,893 --> 00:28:59,823
Rubicon has safeguards
for their safeguards.

571
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:01,323
I can't disarm a warhead.

572
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:02,759
Then don't.

573
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,394
I don't think
you understand how this works.

574
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:05,662
It's not the warheads.
It's just the missile.

575
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,897
If we invert
their horizons...

576
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:08,532
They'll explode
in space.

577
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:27,751
Agh!

578
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,058
Now you know how it feels.

579
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,080
Wait. I thought you
and Donna--

580
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:37,347
Don't worry, she's safe,
but I had to come back

581
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:38,580
to stand with my city,

582
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:39,815
because this
Oliver Queen guy

583
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:41,083
gives a hell
of a speech.

584
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,351
You two were supposed
to stay as backup.

585
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:43,919
I already lost one brother.

586
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:45,187
You two put down
the Ghosts.

587
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:46,455
You keep people safe.

588
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:47,823
What about Darhk?

589
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:50,592
Darhk's mine.

590
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:29,585
What are you going
to do now, Oliver?

591
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:31,888
Stop the posturing.

592
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,624
We both know that
you can't do it.

593
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,359
You spared the life

594
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:41,164
of the man who
killed your mother.

595
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,666
And you killed
a friend of mine.

596
00:30:43,668 --> 00:30:47,937
You killed tens of thousands
of innocent people.

597
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:52,742
With Slade Wilson,
I had a choice.

598
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:56,012
This time, I don't.

599
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:19,002
It's going to take
forever to clean this place up.

600
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:22,249
Well, I wish you guys
the best of luck with that.

601
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,950
You going home
to my mama?

602
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:27,086
Uh, yeah, to pack.

603
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,188
We're leaving town
for a while.

604
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,523
Wait, why?

605
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:32,959
IAB reached out.

606
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:36,228
My suspension is
no longer a suspension,

607
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,364
but, uh, it's funny,
you know,

608
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:40,933
because, you know,
being a cop's all I ever wanted,

609
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:42,969
but when I got that call,

610
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:45,671
I didn't feel a thing.

611
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:50,843
All I could think
about was Laurel, you know?

612
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,645
But then you got
her justice, Oliver,

613
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:55,948
and you got me
some closure,

614
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,517
and I am never going
to forget that.

615
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,955
Well, this is going
to make me feel

616
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,223
like I'm piling on...

617
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,491
What do you mean?

618
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,193
Well, I...

619
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:09,762
I jumped straight out
of the Lazarus Pit

620
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:15,267
right into this,
into--to Speedy,

621
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,003
but, um, I've just
been wondering

622
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,538
if this is even
who I really am,

623
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,874
and then I threatened
to kill a little girl,

624
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:25,611
and I--I realized I'm
my father's daughter,

625
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:29,015
so I--I thought
about Laurel

626
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:34,720
and--and what she'd say
to me if she were here.

627
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:38,224
I think she'd tell me
to get out...

628
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:41,527
Before I lost
too much of myself.

629
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:43,362
I'm sorry, Ollie.

630
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,564
Hey. Come here.

631
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:50,369
You don't have
to apologize to me, ever.

632
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:03,949
Well, it looks like
it's just the 3 of us.

633
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:09,355
Team Arrow,
the original gangstas.

634
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:13,359
Up top.

635
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:22,401
You ok?

636
00:33:22,403 --> 00:33:24,837
Not really.

637
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,373
I told Lyla the truth
about Andy.

638
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,077
What'd she say?

639
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,481
She's a soldier.

640
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:38,584
She understood.

641
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:41,587
But I don't, and I don't
think I ever will.

642
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,689
What are you
going to do?

643
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:47,827
Take some time
away from this team,

644
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:51,597
away from the city...

645
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,332
To figure out where
I went off track

646
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:54,867
and how to get back on.

647
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:59,038
John, I have never
done this without you.

648
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,440
You're the one
who keeps me in line.

649
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:03,476
Oliver, I don't know
if you've been watching lately,

650
00:34:03,478 --> 00:34:08,514
but it's been
the other way around, man.

651
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:27,867
She begged me to do it.

652
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:29,835
Agh!

653
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,070
Listen, I know that this

654
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:32,671
is not going to make
a ton of sense,

655
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:36,008
but all of this
has to do with that.

656
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,043
It is darkness.

657
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,946
Taiana...

658
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:45,451
She was coming
to that darkness.

659
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,855
They destroyed the plane.

660
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:52,658
That was Reiter.

661
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,962
But there's another way
off the island.

662
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,612
And here
I thought

663
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:15,481
you'd never use
the comm gear I gave you

664
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,283
to radio
for a trip home.

665
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:20,519
Well, I lost it
for a while,

666
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:22,988
and the job wasn't done.

667
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,490
And now it is.

668
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:26,325
I sent you here to break
up Reiter's operation

669
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:27,560
and free his prisoners.

670
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:28,794
You did both.

671
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:30,162
You saved
a lot of lives.

672
00:35:30,164 --> 00:35:31,363
I took some, too.

673
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:32,865
Do you remember
what I told you?

674
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,467
That the only way
out is through?

675
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:37,236
Well, I am not out,
Amanda.

676
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:39,672
I'm still filled
with darkness.

677
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:42,341
This was never
about expunging your darkness,

678
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:44,009
Mr. Queen.

679
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,645
That darkness will
always be part of you.

680
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,582
Then what was the point?

681
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,350
To show you
that sometimes killing

682
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:55,321
is the only path
to justice.

683
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:02,595
Director Waller,

684
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,363
what do you want to do
with the artifact?

685
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:06,131
Have it transported
to the SLAB.

686
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,167
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:11,904
So that's it.

688
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:13,572
Just going to bag
and tag everything

689
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:16,008
and pretend like
nothing ever happened?

690
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,176
You've seen what
that idol can do,

691
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:21,046
how large
the world truly is.

692
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:26,452
Speaking of...

693
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:30,923
What am I going
to do with this?

694
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:35,227
Our business here
is concluded, Mr. Queen.

695
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:38,731
Unless it's not.

696
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:42,534
As I said, justice
requires killing.

697
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,236
A man of your talents
could be useful

698
00:36:44,238 --> 00:36:45,804
in hot spots
across the globe,

699
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:51,410
or you could just go back
to playing vigilante.

700
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:55,981
Neither.

701
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:58,617
I have a promise to keep.

702
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:02,955
I know you wouldn't
approve of what I did.

703
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:06,759
I mean, I know that
it's not what...

704
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:08,294
You would have wanted,

705
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:10,262
me killing Darhk,

706
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:11,463
but you were always

707
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:14,233
better than me, Laurel.

708
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:19,004
That is what I loved
most about you.

709
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:22,308
You ok?

710
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,110
No.

711
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,483
It's Thea and John.

712
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:34,320
Them leaving
has to be a blow.

713
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:35,788
And they're leaving

714
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,824
because of their own
personal darkness.

715
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:40,926
I just can't help
but think

716
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:43,028
that maybe they were
infected by mine.

717
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,630
Maybe.

718
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:47,466
Like you said, maybe you
can't become a hero

719
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:48,867
without succumbing
to the darkness

720
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,536
even a little bit,

721
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,104
but you were able
to defeat Darhk

722
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:55,274
by giving the city
its hope back.

723
00:37:55,276 --> 00:37:58,544
You're saying it's
not black and white?

724
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:01,980
I'm saying that
there is a man

725
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:04,483
who killed Darhk
in cold blood,

726
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:07,319
and that same man
stood on top of a car

727
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:10,222
and gave the city
its hope back.

728
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,690
What you're feeling
isn't darkness.

729
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:13,392
It's a schism.

730
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:16,729
You're at war with two
sides of yourself.

731
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,069
Hello.

732
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,704
Mr. Queen,
this is Thomas Kemp.

733
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:27,539
I chair
the city council.

734
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,774
Yes, of course, councilman.

735
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:30,008
What can I help you with?

736
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,377
That impromptu speech
you gave

737
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:32,978
during the city's
latest crisis

738
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,214
got a lot of people's
attention,

739
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:38,851
and there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

740
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:40,352
It's only an interim
appointment.

741
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:42,254
A proper election
will be held in August,

742
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:44,957
but given that you got
48% of the vote before

743
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,759
as a write-in candidate,

744
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:49,561
well, I think that's
just a formality.

745
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,164
I appreciate the optimism.

746
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,099
Are you sure
about this?

747
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,902
You look,
well, conflicted.

748
00:38:56,904 --> 00:38:58,570
Well, someone
very close to me

749
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:03,142
recently told me
that I am...

750
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:05,210
But I am ready for this.

751
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,445
Good.

752
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:08,714
Shall we?

753
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:24,797
Put your left hand
on the Bible.

754
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:28,233
Raise your right hand
and recite the oath.

755
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:30,402
I, Oliver Queen,

756
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:32,604
do solemnly swear
to support the charter

757
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:34,306
and laws of Star City

758
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:36,341
and to faithfully
and impartially

759
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:37,643
perform and discharge

760
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,611
the duties
of the office of mayor

761
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:40,813
according to the law

762
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:43,515
and to the very best
of my ability.

763
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:45,451
Congratulations.

764
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,522
I didn't know
you'd be here.

765
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:33,759
You thought
I was leaving, too?

766
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:38,362
Not a chance.

768
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:19,158
Greg!
Move your head.
