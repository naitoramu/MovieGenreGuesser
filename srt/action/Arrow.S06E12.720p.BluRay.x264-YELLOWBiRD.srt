1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,956
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,294
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,839
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,293
<i>Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,590
<i>By day,
I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,676
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,887
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,434
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,136
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,606
Traitor! I'm taking you
to hell with...

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,935
I'm sorry you didn't
get to know your father.

12
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,611
I guess you're stuck knowing me.

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,280
What I saw in her
is what I see here.

14
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:37,448
It sounds crazy, but if there is just
some way to get through to her...

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,200
- We have a massively huge problem.
- What is it?

16
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,905
The nano-thermite,
when combined with the explosive

17
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,115
creates a thermobaric weapon.

18
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,245
<i>Cayden James could do it.</i>

19
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,746
And he'd probably detonate
in a populated area.

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,160
Maximize casualties.

21
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,835
Your city's entire infrastructure
is under my control.

22
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,384
Buildings, institutions, even people,

23
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,220
all under my dominion.

24
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,387
These are innocent people.

25
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,715
And you can save them...

26
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,723
By wiring 10 million dollars
into that offshore account

27
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,600
<i>no later than 11:30 tonight.</i>

28
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,847
And every night.

29
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,482
Wire the money.

30
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,286
All right, we're all set here.

31
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,332
Captain Hilton, thank you for
stepping up to lead the department.

32
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,159
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

33
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,585
After tonight, they will be.

34
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,290
All right, take me
through the details.

35
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,249
We know Cayden James is monitoring
traffic in and out of the city.

36
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,004
Airports, highways, ports.

37
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,759
But the shoreline
might be the blind spot.

38
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,212
Specifically, right here,

39
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,298
there's no satellite flyover
for about 10 minutes.

40
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,598
That's our window.

41
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,720
SWAT has the perimeter,

42
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,847
so no one's getting in or out
without us knowing it.

43
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,348
Good. When do we make contact?

44
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,728
Should be any minute.

45
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,202
Mr. Mayor, I'm Alex Scott, A.R.G.U.S.

46
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,779
- Good to meet you.
- We're good to move?

47
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,159
Yes.

48
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,161
All clear on shore. Exit. Exit.

49
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,623
- What's wrong?
- No, just some weird feedback.

50
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,794
Are your comms line of sight?

51
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,871
No, we're patched in.

52
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,172
You gotta get those things...

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,001
We gotta get the other divers
out of the water.

54
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,747
$70 million.

55
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,668
At this point,
we've got maybe another day or two.

56
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,252
What about the federal government?

57
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,175
I mean, don't they have plans
for this kind of stuff?

58
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,550
A.R.G.U.S. was our best shot,
and Cayden James was ready for it.

59
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,801
I think that we are on our own.

60
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,762
So does that mean I go forward
with the emergency bomb shelters?

61
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:13,145
Yeah. We need a contingency.
It won't save everyone.

62
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,227
But it's a start.

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,566
How is William holding up?

64
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,193
Doing as well as can be expected.

65
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,238
He's holed up
at an A.R.G.U.S. safe house

66
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,866
with Raisa and a PlayStation 4.

67
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,289
You look like
you could use some rest.

68
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,708
I'll get some if you will.

69
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,911
Like brother like sister, I guess.

70
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,749
Hey, don't worry, okay?

71
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,381
Cayden James is not the first guy
to try to take our city hostage.

72
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,096
We will figure it out.

73
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,431
<i>Cayden James' hold on Star City</i>

74
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,608
<i>has reached eight days
and counting now,</i>

75
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,608
<i>with all routes in and out
of the city under James' control.</i>

76
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,735
<i>Though Mayor Queen
has urged for calm,</i>

77
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,986
<i>tensions are running high</i>

78
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,194
<i>as the threat of the thermobaric bomb
continues to loom.</i>

79
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,573
<i>With supplies running low
and desperation growing,</i>

80
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:14,502
<i>many are left wondering how long will
the city last before it implodes?</i>

81
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,170
That's a damn good question.

82
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,149
You're late.

83
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,229
Sorry.

84
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,158
SCPD's been dealing with the fallout
from last night's debacle.

85
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,654
I didn't know
about the A.R.G.U.S. team

86
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,657
until after Cayden killed 'em.

87
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,704
You believe me, right?

88
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,036
Cayden James likes to play things
close to the vest.

89
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,288
Even with the people he's supposedly
in league with.

90
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,994
Which makes finding the location

91
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,501
of the thermobaric bomb
very difficult.

92
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,583
You believe me, right?

93
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,969
About not knowing
about the A.R.G.U.S. divers?

94
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,549
I already told you, I do.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,597
I guess what I'm asking is,

96
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,721
do you trust me?

97
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,989
Does that answer your question?

98
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,538
- Sorry I'm late.
- Don't be sorry.

99
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,252
Just don't be late.

100
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,259
Vincent Sobel, meet Dinah Drake.

101
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,595
- "Tina Boland" is my cover name.
- Tina Boland.

102
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,937
You got quite the rep.

103
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,265
No idea you were a cop.

104
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,520
That's the idea, isn't it?

105
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,441
Vince has spent the last eight months
in Sean Sonus' operation.

106
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,530
And he is smart.

107
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,030
He makes sure that no one person ever
sees enough of the whole picture.

108
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,236
Sounds like you could use
an extra set of hands.

109
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,242
And eyes, and ears.

110
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,498
I gotta tell you,
Sonus isn't just smart,

111
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,205
he is unpredictable.

112
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,625
This could go south, fast.

113
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,543
When do we start?

114
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,217
Didn't know we were having
a clubhouse meeting.

115
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,553
Only boys allowed today or what?

116
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,520
Ms. Lance is en route.

117
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,483
And this is less a meeting
than it is a wake for Mr. Sheck.

118
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,569
He bought the farm a week ago.

119
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,655
I didn't think we were
sentimental like that.

120
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,285
It's not sentimental. Surprised.

121
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,951
Oliver would not kill a man this way.

122
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,665
None of his team would.

123
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,463
The place wasn't lacking for cops.

124
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,711
One of them probably took him out.

125
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,924
What's really behind
this sudden paranoia?

126
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,435
Mr. Queen was obviously able
to get word outside the cordon

127
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,762
we placed around the city.

128
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,063
To A.R.G.U.S., you mean.

129
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,683
He seems more than capable.

130
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,026
Agreed. But it was unexpected.

131
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,855
As was Mr. Sheck's demise.

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,992
I don't like surprises.

133
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,078
And I like even less the feeling
that I can't trust my comrades.

134
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,501
It sounds like it's just me
you don't trust.

135
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,546
If I didn't, you wouldn't be
drawing breath right now, Mr. Sobel.

136
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,679
Oh...

137
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,761
Oh, I love your face, but that is
just not a good face.

138
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:00,974
What's up?

139
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,724
Just spent the past two hours
trying to convince the city council

140
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,440
that we will get out
from underneath Cayden James' thumb.

141
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,859
Not sure even I believe that,
at this point.

142
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,902
Hey.

143
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,529
You know what I'm looking forward to
once we put Cayden James away?

144
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,863
What's that?

145
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,791
- Our honeymoon.
- Hmm.

146
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,085
We are going on a honeymoon, right?

147
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,913
- Aruba.
- Aruba.

148
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,214
Ooh.

149
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,588
Mmm-hmm. Any news here?

150
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,590
We split the city in half
with the other team.

151
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,719
Divide-and-conquer is not getting us
any closer to finding Cayden James.

152
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,596
Our sector has been quiet
for a few hours.

153
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,892
"Has been" being
the operative phrase.

154
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,603
Okay, facial recognition
picked up Vigilante,

155
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,979
despite his mask having no face.

156
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,152
Cayden James' people don't ordinarily
walk around like that.

157
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,231
We might have caught a break.
Let's text John the location.

158
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,867
I'm headed your way.

159
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,260
Going somewhere?

160
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,220
Where's Cayden James?

161
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,431
You're making a mistake.

162
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,765
You've got three seconds.

163
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,562
- Oliver, listen.
- One!

164
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,689
- I'm trying to stop Cayden.
- Two!

165
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,271
I can't blow my cover.

166
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,897
Three.

167
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,448
Hold your fire.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

168
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,234
- He's a friendly.
- What?

169
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,695
He's here for a meet, with us.

170
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,280
He's undercover
with James' group.

171
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,830
We were gonna tell you guys.

172
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,032
Eventually.

173
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,422
I can't believe that you had time
to secretly put all this together

174
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,303
and continue starting our start-up.

175
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,011
Well, being single does wonders
for your time management.

176
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,563
Okay, on your next date you are
not allowed to lead with that.

177
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,807
How do you know you can trust him?

178
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,767
He saved my life last week.

179
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,485
Killed one of James' men to do it.

180
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,778
And he's in love with Dinah.

181
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,739
Look, just stating the facts.

182
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,574
Vince is working on locating
the thermobaric bomb.

183
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,445
We take that out of play
and we got the situation handled.

184
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,290
What kind of progress are you making
locating the bomb?

185
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,412
Not much.

186
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,585
Cayden keeps the bomb
on the move constantly.

187
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,002
He's become especially paranoid
since I killed one of his men.

188
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,007
Your stunt with A.R.G.U.S. last night
didn't help matters.

189
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,426
So why don't you just take us

190
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,003
to where Cayden
and his men are hiding?

191
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,840
'Cause the second you show up,
he'll detonate the bomb.

192
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,016
The amplifier he has,
he'll take out the city.

193
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,093
He's right.

194
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,053
And until we find out where
that bomb is, we've got no moves.

195
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,894
Okay, well, then we just...
We find out where the bomb is.

196
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,316
Last year we used a sniffer device

197
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,189
to pull information from
Prometheus' mother's house.

198
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,232
You wanna use the same device
for Cayden James?

199
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,312
That's exactly
what I wanna do.

200
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,901
We can gather all his
ones and zeroes.

201
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,699
There's gotta be a scrap of data
left in there somewhere.

202
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,742
Then we have someone to plant
Felicity's toy for us.

203
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,409
Yeah.
There's just one small problem.

204
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,706
- Just one?
- Well, two, actually.

205
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,285
The sniffer needs to be manually
implanted into Cayden's server...

206
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,121
No, no. There's no way he can do that
without Cayden noticing, Felicity.

207
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,751
Especially now
that he's circling the wagons.

208
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,507
I knew what I signed up for.

209
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,588
I didn't expect this to be easy.

210
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,630
What else?

211
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,512
Okay, Cayden's server
is deep within the building,

212
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,219
so while our comms will be working,
transmitting a data-pull that large,

213
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,679
it requires line of sight.

214
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,389
Which means you'll
have to install the sniffer,

215
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,348
then wait for it to download
the content to Cayden James' server.

216
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,526
Making sure Cayden doesn't see you or
the sniffer. That'd be bad, very bad.

217
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,440
And then get it outside
so you can transmit the files.

218
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,526
Yeah, that sounds
like more than two problems.

219
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,361
Sounds like a good way
of getting yourself killed.

220
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,700
Then it's a good thing I heal fast.

221
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,361
Vince.

222
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,623
May I speak with you, please?

223
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,875
Ms. Queen, I'm telling you,
there is nothing liquid.

224
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,968
And we have no way
of borrowing capital.

225
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,671
Jake, that's just
not gonna work for us,

226
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,930
so I need you to try
to find more money.

227
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,430
I might be able to pull
a few hundred thousand but...

228
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,061
That's not gonna be enough money
for Cayden James,

229
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,734
so I just... I need you to try
and find some more.

230
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,910
Sorry, sometimes he just needs to be
pushed a little bit.

231
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,988
Quentin, what's up?

232
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,957
She's been following me.

233
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,579
- Laurel?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,411
It started a couple of days ago.

235
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,212
Okay, have you talked to her?

236
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,876
Not quite.

237
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,428
Every time I turn around,
she disappears.

238
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,720
What do you think it means?

239
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,431
I think maybe we made
some kind of connection.

240
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,679
She wants to reach out,

241
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,802
but she's afraid.

242
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,638
- Does that sound crazy?
- No.

243
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,225
Not after everything
we've seen lately, no.

244
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,692
So what do we do?

245
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,113
If it seems like she's trying
to reach out to you, then...

246
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,442
I don't know, maybe we
just gotta find a way

247
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,869
for you to reach out to her.

248
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,036
What's on your mind?

249
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,664
Dinah, Curtis
and Rene trust you.

250
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,165
I'm not there yet.

251
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,343
I want you to try to imagine
how little I give a damn.

252
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,052
You've taken a shot at me.

253
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,802
Matter of fact,
you've taken a shot

254
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,598
at nearly everybody in that room,

255
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,769
so I will be convinced
that you're not playing us,

256
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,848
the way that you claim
to be playing Cayden James.

257
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,516
I don't have to convince you.

258
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,394
Because you're not stopping me
from doing this.

259
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,563
- Are you sure?
- I am.

260
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,738
Because you know saving this city
means doing whatever's necessary.

261
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,495
And you know that means using me.

262
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,045
Did Oliver push you to do this?

263
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,970
He didn't have to, D.
It's the right play.

264
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,640
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

265
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,301
I'm not so sure.

266
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,261
Something just doesn't feel right.

267
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,813
You know, the same way it did for you
when everything went bad with Sonus.

268
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,310
That was my call, D.

269
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,936
Don't you wear that guilt.

270
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,310
I don't wanna lose you again.

271
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,195
I'm so happy to hear that.

272
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,029
And you won't.

273
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,624
Aces and queens.

274
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,709
Got me.

275
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,760
And you are in the black, barely.

276
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,177
Thanks.

277
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,348
Yeah, this cash inflow coming
from San Francisco is huge,

278
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,640
but it wasn't very efficient.

279
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,135
You know, if I knew more I might be
able to maximize revenue stream.

280
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,228
Sorry. I know I'm not supposed
to ask specifics.

281
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,981
Just... We need a little more of it,
that's all I'm saying.

282
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,903
I'll take that under advisement.

283
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,489
All right.

284
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,818
Well, I'm going to go home
for the night.

285
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,161
Good night, boys.

286
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,335
I'll walk with you.

287
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,209
Can't let a lady walk home alone, hmm?

288
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,381
That was subtle.
What, you didn't have a neon sign?

289
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,588
It's fine, no one noticed.

290
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,555
So what did his book say?

291
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,226
He's got a boatload
of money floating around

292
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,306
neither of us have eyes on.

293
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,357
And seriously, Vince,
Sonus should not see us together.

294
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,276
They all think I'm just trying
to get in your pants.

295
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,691
Hmm.

296
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,447
Well, if only wishing made it so.

297
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,372
Nice.

298
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,042
Love what you guys haven't done
with the place.

299
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,217
Let's get this over with.

300
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,216
We turned your room into a home gym,
because...

301
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,298
'Cause this extremely
awkward situation

302
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,883
needs to be masked with humor.

303
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,390
I think what she means to say is,
welcome back.

304
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,805
We have the inside man,
you have the tech.

305
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,773
It's the only reason
we're back, hoss.

306
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,814
- Is Vince on site?
- Should be, as of five minutes ago.

307
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,646
That is, if everything
goes according to plan.

308
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,656
You sound like it might not.

309
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,608
Vince said he doesn't have access
to the server room,

310
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,692
so if anyone spots him in there,

311
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,947
he's gonna have
a lot of explaining to do.

312
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,074
We've got eyes.

313
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,529
- Can I talk to him?
- Yeah.

314
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,078
Hey, Vince.

315
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,455
<i>You get any kind of
bad feeling here at all, you abort.</i>

316
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,535
<i>You hear me?</i>

317
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,879
<i>Don't worry, I'll see you soon.</i>

318
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,707
He's at the server.

319
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,344
<i>The door to
the server room is locked.</i>

320
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,971
You guys have a solve for this?

321
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,344
Try 0-6-1-4-1-9-9-8.

322
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,888
- "Try"?
- It's his son's birthday.

323
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,353
- If you're wrong, he's dead.
- I'm not gonna be wrong.

324
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,485
<i>Okay, Vince, you're in the red
zone, just let the sniffer do its thing.</i>

325
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,500
Eighty terabytes of data.

326
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,795
You guys can get comfortable.
This is gonna take a minute.

327
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,215
Mr. Sobel?

328
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,419
Frack.

329
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,465
I think we need to talk.

330
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,685
<i>All of my people
have specific domains.</i>

331
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,850
<i>I don't believe
that IT is one of yours,</i>

332
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,938
<i>which means you would not have
a proper pass code to enter.</i>

333
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,442
How much data's been copied?

334
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,606
20%.

335
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,859
No, but Mr. Sheck did.

336
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,157
He was a little more loose-lipped
then you'd like.

337
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,780
Rest in peace.

338
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,953
Still, it doesn't explain
what exactly you're doing in here.

339
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,917
- We gotta pull him out.
- Dinah, not yet.

340
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,213
- Oliver!
- Okay, wait.

341
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,797
Vince, if you wanna stay alive,
repeat exactly what I say.

342
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,636
- "You think just..."
- ...because I can handle a gun,

343
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,430
doesn't mean I know
the difference between

344
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,350
a transpolymer hybrid
and a fiber-optic cable.

345
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,890
I'm just impressed.

346
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,936
I wanted to know how you maximize
the data through-put.

347
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,979
Sorry.

348
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,814
I should have asked first.

349
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,442
Perhaps.

350
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,199
I may have underestimated you.

351
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,701
It seems that you have more skill
than I gave you credit for.

352
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,791
I keep telling people
I'm more than just a pretty face.

353
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,123
Keep him talking, we're at 80%.

354
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,258
Funny thing is,
I underestimated you, too.

355
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,626
Is that right?

356
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,134
When you recruited me to help you
take this city from Oliver Queen,

357
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,431
I didn't think you'd have
the resolve to do

358
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,679
what was necessary
to make him fear you.

359
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,516
I was wrong.

360
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,140
Does that mean
that you also fear me, Mr. Sobel?

361
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,392
I'd be a fool not to.

362
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,525
Such flattery.

363
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,532
Are we done here?

364
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,331
<i>Yeah, we're good.
Take the sniffer and leave.</i>

365
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,992
After you.

366
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,089
<i>It appears that Mr. Knyazev
has returned from the ports.</i>

367
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,843
Join us in five.

368
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,100
Absolutely.

369
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,219
<i>You were amazing.</i>

370
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,349
<i>Yeah, we'll engrave your Oscar</i>

371
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,429
<i>when you're out of the building.</i>

372
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,975
Heading out now.

373
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,607
That's our final offer.

374
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,614
Oh, please, your final offer
is never really final, Sean.

375
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,278
You got a vice under there?

376
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,329
You want me to just
gently put my nuts in it for you?

377
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,408
So, are we gonna celebrate or what?

378
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,292
I think she's gonna drop
half the product

379
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,462
and leave us with our asses
hanging out, like she did last time.

380
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,631
I'll make good on my end.
You don't need to worry about me.

381
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,083
I'd take a look
at your own house first.

382
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,963
What the hell are you talking about?

383
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,885
The Darbinyans rooted out
a mole last month.

384
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,429
An OCB operative.

385
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,472
A few fingernails later,
he got very chatty.

386
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,972
According to him,
you have a cop on your payroll.

387
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,113
Hold up. Mr. James wants to see you.

388
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,033
Did I teach you that move?

389
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,955
I taught you that move.

390
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,377
All right. Transmitting now.

391
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,168
It's coming through.
Man, this is the mother lode.

392
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,211
We're gonna need Alena on this
to help us process.

393
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,971
<i>Now get your ass back to Helix.</i>

394
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,047
On my way.

395
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,230
We need to call Singh.

396
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,440
Roll this thing up right now.

397
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,479
We don't even have Sonus yet.

398
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,402
We've got enough.

399
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,285
If the Alvarez buy falls through,
we have got nothing.

400
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,785
Vince, we need Sonus in the room.

401
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,125
- We need money changing hands.
- I know.

402
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,954
But what we don't know
is which one of us is made.

403
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,883
No, baby.
If Sonus knew anything at all,

404
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,960
one of us would already be dead.

405
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,884
We've been working
at this for months.

406
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,007
And we're close.
You know, we're so close.

407
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,598
We can't pull the pin on this now.

408
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,649
All right.

409
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,851
We'll play it your way.

410
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,320
Mr. Sobel.

411
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,160
Sorry. I got a text
from my girlfriend.

412
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,626
She's at the hospital.
Thinks it's appendicitis.

413
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,374
Well, I'm sure the doctors
are doing everything they can.

414
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,708
I need you here
for a rather important assignment.

415
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,092
Yeah? What's that?

416
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,714
Rooting out a traitor.

417
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,774
Cayden sure has a lot of junk
in his server

418
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,648
for someone who's as type-A
as you say he is.

419
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,230
Well, brilliant people are often
slobs. Or so I tell myself.

420
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,860
- And my dates.
- Show-off.

421
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,284
- I can't even get a date.
- Anything yet?

422
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,453
Well, if by "anything," you mean
the location of the bomb...

423
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,748
- No, not yet.
- Okay.

424
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,120
How much longer is this gonna take?

425
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,456
Yeah. How much longer
do I got to be here?

426
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,037
'Cause I'm starting to get PTSD.

427
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,417
- Maybe an hour.
- Hopefully less.

428
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,629
I'm gonna head back to Helix.
I should've heard from Vince by now.

429
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,176
I'll go with you.

430
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,340
Sorry, boys.

431
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,716
Guess I'm just lucky.

432
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,676
More like pretty woman
make smart men dumb.

433
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,102
Speak for yourself, Declan.

434
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,804
Hey, Tina,
can I borrow you for a sec?

435
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,564
Yeah. What's up?

436
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,150
I got the Alvarez buy coming up.

437
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,727
I wanted your expertise
on the numbers.

438
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,062
Yeah, sure.
You want me to dive in now?

439
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,692
You can start on page 12.

440
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,774
I noticed something
a little concerning.

441
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,828
Looks like your luck is up.

442
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,629
You were always the enigma,
Mr. Sobel.

443
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,757
The vigilante willing
to ally himself with criminals

444
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,058
to take out other vigilantes.

445
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,386
I must confess,
I never totally bought into it.

446
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,147
Given your background
as an undercover operative,

447
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,393
I would have been a fool to.

448
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,900
I don't strike you as a fool, do I?

449
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,561
No.

450
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,196
You are coming off
a little crazy, though.

451
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,488
I've done good work for you.

452
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,037
I got no love for Oliver Queen.
You know that.

453
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,286
I don't know anything for certain.

454
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,583
That's what this is for.

455
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,767
I must admit, that is fascinating.

456
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,771
You can torture me all you want.

457
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,896
You'll keep getting the same answer.

458
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,907
I didn't do anything.

459
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,572
I admire your tenacity.

460
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,446
But even a man
who's difficult to kill

461
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,532
cannot withstand torture,
at least, not forever.

462
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,120
Hmm.

463
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,500
In my country, we do things a little,
how do you say... Dirtier?

464
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,090
We'll give the two of you
some privacy.

465
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,885
Okey-dokey.

466
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,474
Where shall we begin?

467
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,115
Okay, Thea, I'm inside.
Are you sure she's still following?

468
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,284
<i>She's right
behind you. Keep moving.</i>

469
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,286
All right.

470
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,603
Laurel? Wait, wait, wait.
Don't go. Please.

471
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,141
This was a mistake.

472
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,851
If you really thought that,
you wouldn't have spent

473
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,231
the past few nights following me.

474
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,235
<i>- I think you wanna talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.</i>

475
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,316
Then don't.

476
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,986
Just listen.

477
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,913
And watch.

478
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,585
You see her?

479
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:31,871
This is Laurel.

480
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,005
This is my Laurel.

481
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,259
She was incredible.

482
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:50,023
When I look into your eyes,
I see the girl I raised.

483
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,101
I see the same warmth,

484
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,319
kindness and love.

485
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,315
And I see a hero.

486
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,818
You just need to see it, too.

487
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,783
Please.

488
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,824
This isn't me.

489
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,035
This isn't... This isn't me!

490
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,593
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

491
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,387
You know, I know it sounds crazy,

492
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,510
but I think I just saw
my daughter in her eyes.

493
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,476
I saw her.

494
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,727
Vince didn't make it back to Helix.

495
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,687
- Did he reach out to any of you?
- No.

496
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,072
- Boom!
- Goes the dynamite.

497
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,200
Maybe not the best choice of words
considering the circumstances.

498
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,569
Oh, if by circumstances
you mean locating

499
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,780
Cayden's bomb then yes, we just did.

500
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,036
- Where?
- Warehouse District, 10th and Valley.

501
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,662
What exactly
are we walking ourselves into here?

502
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:51,826
We have no idea.

503
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,411
It's a surveillance dead zone,
we can't really see a thing.

504
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,337
- No surprise there.
- The place is massive.

505
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,881
Then we need everybody.

506
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,667
Agreed?

507
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,510
- What's that?
- That's Vince.

508
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,974
He just activated his comms.

509
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,678
<i>The pain stops
once I have my answers.</i>

510
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,229
Vince!

511
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,515
Oh, my God. We need to help him.

512
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,818
Hey, look, like Vince said,
James is constantly moving the bomb.

513
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,111
This might be our only chance.

514
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,655
- He is being tortured!
- And he can handle it.

515
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,441
With his healing abilities they can't
do anything to hurt him permanently.

516
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,117
As far as we know,
this could be a trap.

517
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,490
Once the bomb is rendered safe,

518
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,867
we go back in, we get Vince.

519
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,198
He has already been made.

520
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,579
By the time we get there,
that bomb is gonna be long gone!

521
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,911
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do!

522
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,419
Look, we all got him into this.

523
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,625
We should all be getting him out!

524
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,214
Fine.

525
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,759
- I'll do it myself.
- Dinah.

526
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,347
Vince would not want you
to do it this way!

527
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,427
Don't you dare!

528
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,643
You know damn well
if it was Felicity out there,

529
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,191
if it was Lyla,
this wouldn't even be up for debate.

530
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,191
Vince is my family.

531
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,447
But I'm not letting him die.

532
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,107
Not again.

533
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,156
Dinah?

534
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,833
You're not talking me
out of this, Curtis.

535
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,080
We know.

536
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,331
That's why we're coming with you.

537
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,578
You're our family, too.

538
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,548
We'll save Vince.

539
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,090
You guys save the city.

540
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,462
We're not gonna be able to cover
the bomb's location

541
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,637
with half the manpower.

542
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,183
Looks like you're gonna
have to figure out a way, hoss.

543
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,284
- How much further?
- About 100 yards or so, give or take.

544
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,956
That might as well be
a mile away at this rate.

545
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,785
- Not if you draw their fire!
- Follow the T-Sphere. Go!

546
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,663
Looks like your little buddies
finally found us.

547
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,789
Took longer than expected.

548
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,458
Good for us. Bad for him.

549
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,958
No sign of the bomb. You?

550
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,257
Nothing.

551
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,060
This place is too big to search.
We're gonna run out of time!

552
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,061
I've got movement. East corridor.

553
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,623
<i>Hello...</i>

554
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,330
No need for me
to explain choice here, yes?

555
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,288
- I thought you were an honorable man!
<i>- I am.</i>

556
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,543
Why else I give you choice?

557
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,629
<i>Find bomb, or save...</i>

558
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,142
Go. I'll take care of them.

559
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,231
Vince?

560
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,200
Thank God.

561
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,453
Smart work
activating your comms.

562
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,784
I didn't.

563
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,481
Hang on.

564
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,853
Vince.

565
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,397
I'll get you free.

566
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,357
Oh, I highly doubt that.

567
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,502
Your ability to withstand
extreme punishment is impressive.

568
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,502
But we all have our limits.

569
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,718
Let's find Mr. Sobel's.

570
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,269
Don't make me doubt your loyalty,
too, Ms. Lance.

571
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,232
No... No... Please.

572
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,403
Don't...

573
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,493
Hey, Tina.

574
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,287
You're not lookin' too good.

575
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,995
But I got something here
that might put a smile on your face.

576
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,751
Look who we got here.

577
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,416
My God.

578
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:14,792
Vinny.

579
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,307
I am begging you. Please!

580
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,694
Oh, my God.

581
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,950
Hey!

582
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,671
Baby.

583
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:38,922
Baby, wake up.

584
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,340
No, baby, please.
Baby, please wake up.

585
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,388
- Wake up.
- He's gone, D.

586
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,934
No.

587
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,269
Oh, my God.

588
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,899
No, baby, not again. No. No.

589
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,900
Baby, no.

590
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,916
She hasn't moved or said a word
in over an hour.

591
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,708
After my wife was murdered,
it took me days.

592
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,625
What do we do?

593
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,006
Nothing.

594
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,092
I'm fine.

595
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,757
You're definitely not fine.

596
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,637
How can we help you, Dinah?

597
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,852
You already have...

598
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,026
By having my back.

599
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:40,817
Did they get the bomb?

600
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,371
Tell me.

601
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,208
Felicity called.

602
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,501
There was nothing they could do.

603
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,793
Vince died for nothing.

604
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,482
Sorry.

605
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,314
We needed more numbers.
We didn't have it.

606
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,363
- Any word from the other team?
- I wish it was better news.

607
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:28,865
Vince?

608
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,196
He didn't make it.

609
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,536
How is Dinah?

610
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,870
As good as she can be.

611
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,797
It was a choice between
an entire city or one man.

612
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:41,965
He made the right call.

613
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,463
I know it feels like
this was all for nothing,

614
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,544
but it's not entirely true.

615
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,013
Alena found something.

616
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,306
I've been working on my data haul
from Cayden's servers.

617
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,185
Mmm-hmm. What'd you find?

618
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,264
Evidence he received
while in Corto Maltese.

619
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,474
Video of his son's murder.

620
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,904
It's Cayden's son, Owen Post.

621
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,488
Guess we know
why he hates you so much.

622
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,536
This is fabricated.

623
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,613
It didn't happen.

624
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,369
This could not have been you.
You were in Hub City.

625
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,916
Yeah, but Owen Post
was still murdered,

626
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,118
supposedly by the Green Arrow.

627
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,252
<i>Wouldn't the SCPD be all over this?</i>

628
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,329
The FBI?

629
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,834
Records on the case were wiped clean.

630
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,957
Right. So, Cayden wanted me
all to himself

631
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,714
and didn't want anyone
to get in the way.

632
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,713
How do we prove that this is fake?

633
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,797
Well, we're working on that,

634
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,848
but there is something
super-interesting about this.

635
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,763
The digital alteration of this

636
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,469
is consistent with that of the bogus

637
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,225
surveillance photo of you
in the Green Arrow suit.

638
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,522
We thought
Cayden James leaked that image.

639
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,600
Whoever doctored this
leaked that photo.

640
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,309
To make James think
you killed his son.

641
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,146
Whoever planned this,
knew exactly how Cayden would react.

642
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,902
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

643
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,027
If that's true,

644
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,618
Vince wasn't the only traitor
that Cayden has to worry about.

645
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:02,913
Hey.

646
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,174
You know what?
Laurel, she needs to see this. Right?

647
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,416
'Cause the video worked,

648
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,594
it got through to her a little bit,
but this is gonna...

649
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,304
What is it? You all right?

650
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,217
I think we might've been wrong
about Laurel.

651
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,597
What are you talking about?

652
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,678
Felicity just called.

653
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,266
Dinah's former partner,
her boyfriend...

654
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,516
Right.

655
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,190
- He's dead.
- Oh...

656
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,695
And Laurel killed him.

657
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,574
I know how badly
you want to believe in this,

658
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,156
and believe in her and then...

659
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,375
Seriously, Quentin, I really do, too.

660
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,586
I'm so sorry.

661
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,449
You shouldn't be here.

662
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,459
Dinah, please give me
a chance to explain.

663
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:26,129
You lost that right when you decided
to leave Vince on his own to die.

664
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,548
I'm truly sorry about
what happened to Vince.

665
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,676
Because I know what he meant to you.

666
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,054
But this was his call.

667
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,341
And he knew what he signed up for.

668
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,304
Wow, you are really bad at apologies.

669
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,854
I'm not here to apologize.

670
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,445
Of course you're not.

671
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,027
I'm here to explain that...

672
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,697
This wasn't all for nothing.

673
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,617
Felicity's been going through
the data that Vince pulled out.

674
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,501
And for the first time...
Dinah, for the first time...

675
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,717
- We have some viable options.
- "Viable options"?

676
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,548
You know, I used to tell Vince

677
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,005
his way of seeking justice
wasn't "viable."

678
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,637
I convinced him to change.

679
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,018
Just how you convinced me.

680
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,479
But you know what, Oliver?

681
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,267
Vince was right.

682
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,027
The only way to bring justice
to this city is with a bullet.

683
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,240
No. Dinah...

684
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,364
I need you to listen to me.

685
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,071
I'm going to make sure
Vince didn't die for nothing.

686
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,747
I'm going to kill
every last one of them.

687
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,042
Starting with Laurel.
