His name is Ra's al Ghul,

00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:18,914
Yeah, I guess so. Uh, are
those the cargo manifests

332
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,782
- for the whole city?
- Yeah, yeah.

333
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,684
Although, you know, I got to
ask, what do you need these for?

334
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,220
Just a RICO case that I'm second chairing.

335
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:27,856
Right.

336
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,759
- Dad?
- Yeah, sorry.

337
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,227
I just... [Sighs]

338
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:34,396
Have you heard from Sara lately?

339
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:36,498
No. Why?

340
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,068
I ran into her a few weeks back.

341
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,506
And something just felt a little... off.

342
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:47,480
Then I ran into that friend of hers.

343
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:50,649
You know, the one with
the, uh, the boy hair?

344
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:51,917
Sin.

345
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,018
Yeah, Sin, that's it.

346
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,668
She said something strange.

347
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,707
She said that the woman
in black isn't Sara.

348
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,112
That doesn't make any sense.

349
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:09,081
No.

350
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,818
I mean, look, I just want to talk to her,

351
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,586
you know, Sara or not.

352
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:19,674
But look, don't worry, I
said I'd start taking it easy,

353
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,676
I meant it.

354
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:24,145
I'll get out of your hair.

355
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,727
Now I've been wondering,

356
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:41,429
how do you decide between the red hoodie

357
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,498
and the one with the mask?

358
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,676
I'm glad you know.

359
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:45,635
I feel pretty lame

360
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,369
for not recognizing my own brother

361
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:48,870
just because he's wearing a hood.

362
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:51,406
I can't believe you knew before I did.

363
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,675
He saved my life, Thea.

364
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:57,479
He saved a lot of people's lives.

365
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:01,576
He thinks we need Merlyn's help.

366
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:02,777
Hmm.

367
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,545
And what do you think?

368
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:08,016
I think I want to get as far away

369
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:10,718
from Malcolm Merlyn as I possibly can.

370
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,387
Well, there's your answer right there.

371
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,089
Hey.

372
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,491
Sorry.

373
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:17,759
May I borrow him for a second?

374
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,727
[Scoffs] Apparently,

375
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:22,530
he's been more yours
than mine lately, so...

376
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:32,206
What happened?

377
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,709
One of our trackers sent a signal
from the Starling City docks.

378
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,845
Except we don't have any
tracking devices in the field.

379
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,181
Unless we do.

380
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:42,450
It's Laurel.

381
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:44,752
You tagged Laurel with a tracer?

382
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:47,355
If she's going to be reckless,
I need to know what she's doing.

383
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:49,423
Well, she's definitely doing something.

384
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:52,727
I'm just not exactly
sure how reckless it is.

385
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:56,130
I ran the manifests on all these
shipping containers that you see here.

386
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,800
One of these leads back
to Zytle's old supplier.

387
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,768
Looks like Vertigo's back in business.

388
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,703
[Sighs] She's going to get herself killed.

389
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:05,473
Suit up.

390
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,558
Hey!

391
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,340
Werner: Wonderful seeing you again.

392
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:42,977
Ooh, I fancy the new outfit.

393
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,979
[Groaning]

394
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,714
[Gasping]

395
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:50,397
Feeling my Vertigo, dear.

396
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:56,070
Wonderful.

397
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,978
Dinah Laurel Lance.

398
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:08,015
- [Grunts]
- Selfish bitch.

399
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:11,552
You're not a hero.

400
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:13,888
You're a liar.

401
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,090
A fraud.

402
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:19,093
And an addict.

403
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,925
Sara...

404
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:53,794
Sara, please, please.

405
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:55,563
I'm your sister.

406
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:58,499
Then why are you trying to take my place?

407
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:03,337
Oliver: Get away from her!

408
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:05,039
You should be dead!

409
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,908
I salute your persistence!

410
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:13,247
[All grunting]

411
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:26,160
Laurel: Help me!

412
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:27,761
Help!

413
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:33,133
Help me, please.

414
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:40,189
Roy: Need an IV.

415
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:41,491
Watch her.

416
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:44,260
You're going to be ok.

417
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,795
It's going to be ok.

418
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:50,333
Why did I have to die?

419
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:51,901
Sara?

420
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:54,370
If you wanted to be me, you could have.

421
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:56,539
I didn't have to die.

422
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,909
I am so sorry! I am so sorry!

423
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:01,978
Sara! I am so... [Gasps]

424
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,652
Thea: Ollie?

425
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:12,422
I'm... I'm sorry, I just wanted to talk.

426
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:14,190
You need to go back upstairs.

427
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:15,238
Now!

428
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:16,527
Hey!

429
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:19,062
Don't talk to her like
that. You brought her in;

430
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:20,230
you don't have the right to kick her out.

431
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:22,899
I'm not. I'm protecting her.

432
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:24,534
By telling her what to do?

433
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:26,336
Work with Malcolm Merlyn, let
him get his hooks deeper...

434
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:27,537
Enough. She's my sister.

435
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,706
She makes her own choices, Oliver!

436
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,741
It's ok. I... we can talk later.

437
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:35,078
I just... just, is Laurel ok?

438
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,447
Is she a part of this, too?

439
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,849
She's going to be fine.

440
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:42,585
I promise. Just...

441
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:45,421
Please go back upstairs.

442
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,499
What the hell was that?

443
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:59,135
You think you're the only
person who can stand up for Thea?

444
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:01,738
I'm trying to figure out
why you're standing up to me!

445
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,239
- All right, maybe we just need to throttle back.
- No.

446
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,909
We need this. Oliver, you were gone.

447
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,844
Dead. At least we thought you were,

448
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,579
and we had to go on with our lives.

449
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:11,735
And doing that meant not
doing things your way.

450
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,750
Fine! I'm back now.

451
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:15,785
That doesn't mean that we can go back.

452
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:18,021
And you do not have the
right to come back here

453
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:20,190
and question everyone's choices.

454
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:39,042
Just let me know if there's
any change in her condition.

455
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:55,358
- Hey, how's it going?
- [Thea sighs]

456
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:01,798
What's that for?

457
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,267
My life has been really complicated lately,

458
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:06,836
so I... I just need something simple.

459
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:09,272
So...

460
00:26:19,497 --> 00:26:22,832
This seat taken?

461
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,467
It's a free country.

462
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:27,837
Apparently.

463
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:33,576
The first time that we went after Zytle,

464
00:26:33,578 --> 00:26:37,614
I told you that this was my crusade.

465
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:40,216
Doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

466
00:26:40,218 --> 00:26:41,584
You're right. It isn't.

467
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,119
Diggle, I get that I was gone for...

468
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:45,488
No, you weren't gone... you were dead.

469
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,892
And all of us, including me,
we were ready to hang it up.

470
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:50,660
Why didn't you?

471
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:52,662
Because I realized we
weren't just fighting for you;

472
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:54,964
we were fighting for ourselves, too.

473
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:57,467
And that includes Roy.

474
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,636
And, yes, that includes Laurel.

475
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:02,560
- [Sighs] She's not a soldier.
- Neither were you.

476
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:05,542
That's not the same
thing, and you know that.

477

[Exhales]

478
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:12,882
What I know, Oliver, is
that you started something.

479
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:17,520
Something strong enough
to live on past you.

480
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:20,957
The question is,

481
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,893
can you live with what it's become?

482
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:29,532
[Footsteps on stairs]

483
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,974
Oliver.

484
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:42,276
Are you all right?

485
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:46,814
I told them you were on the ferry.

486
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,649
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,518
They tortured you.

488
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,553
I sold you out.

489
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,422
No, you didn't.

490
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,657
Because we were never going to Shanghai.

491
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:59,160
I lied.

492
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,863
A precaution just in
case you were captured.

493
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:03,631
Then how'd they find you?

494
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:06,200
They didn't. When I found
out you'd been taken,

495

When Zytle hit me with Vertigo, I...

509
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:49,877
I saw Sara.

510

She was alive.

And she was calling me a fraud.

512

just as much to hide her demons

Who was he?

663
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,807
Malcolm: One of Ra's agents.

664
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,776
Roy...

665
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:35,178
Could you give us a minute?

666
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,987
Really hope you're not
expecting a thank you.

667
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,657
No parent needs gratitude
for saving their child.

668
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,728
I didn't ask to be a part of this.

669
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,799
I didn't ask for any of this.

670
00:38:55,801 --> 00:39:00,403
[Sighs] Maybe you're right.

671
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:04,140
Maybe we can't do this without him.

672
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:11,181
But I am never going to
forget the things you've done.

673
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,750
Or the person that you are.

674
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,252
Understood.

675
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:17,854
But before we can begin,

676
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:22,125
there's something that
only the two of you can do.

677
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,728
Ra's al Ghul preys upon
the fears of his enemies.

678
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,564
Conquer your own fear,

679
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:31,067
and you eliminate that critical advantage.

680
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,871
For you, there is only one place

681
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:39,309
on earth uniquely suited to doing that.

682
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:40,910
So you're leaving again?

683
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,712
She's got a point, man. You just got back.

684
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,748
It's just for a few days.

685
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,983
Ordinarily, I wouldn't do this.

686
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,120
But it's for Thea.

687
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:51,821
And if you've shown me anything,

688
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:56,893
it's that the city is more
than safe in your hands.

689
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,396
All of your hands.

690
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,900
Thank you.

691
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,150
Ollie told you we're heading out for a bit?

692
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,086
You cool with it all?

693
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,456
[Exhales] After the whole chase thing,

694
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,891
I think it's going to be a little while

695
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:30,327
before I'm cool with anything.

696
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,300
[Chuckles]

697
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,235
What was that for?

698
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:42,072
Take your pick. Saving my life,

699
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:45,041
or standing up to Oliver about Malcolm.

700
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:50,613
I should get going.

701
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,350
[Exhales]

702
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,023
Oliver: Come on, Speedy,
we have four more miles

703
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:02,659
to make before night fall.

704
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,817
Ah, God.

705
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:07,319
I get that Malcolm wants
to whip us into shape

706
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:09,955
so we can face the
League, but don't you think

707
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:12,224
it's a little bit excessive?

708
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:15,060
We've been here for two hours.
Are you complaining already?

709
00:41:15,062 --> 00:41:19,432
I... I started thinking it
after the first ten minutes.

710
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:22,601
Well, give it time.

711
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:24,937
Eventually this place will feel like home.

712
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:27,440
It does not look like home.

713
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:30,576
It was for me. For other people,

714
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:33,946
this is Purgatory.

715
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,952
You're not dead, if that's
what you're wondering.

716
00:41:39,954 --> 00:41:42,855
Once again, you have the good fortune

717
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:45,458
of being uniquely qualified to help me.

718
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,650
Me? Why?

719
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:51,587
Chen Na Wei has left Hong
Kong. We've tracked her here.

720
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:55,691
Here? Where are we...

721
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,962
Welcome home, Mr. Queen.

722
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:07,643
