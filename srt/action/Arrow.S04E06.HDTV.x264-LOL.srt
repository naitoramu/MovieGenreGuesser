1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:01,747
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:03,362
This city needs someone

3
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,773
to stand up who isn't
hiding behind a mask.

4
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,039
It needs a leader.

5
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,241
So, I've decided
to run for mayor.

6
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,976
Ollie, this is Alex Davis,

7
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,712
the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

8
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,748
At the house, I looked Sara in the eyes.
She wasn't there.

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,851
I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,753
That's why she's
after me, you know.

11
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,822
It's blood lust;
She's consumed by it.

12
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,692
It's the same pain I feel
when I think about Ra's.

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,429
If she kills me,
she'll be ok.

14
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,496
There's more
to the recording--

15
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,731
something
overlapping with it.

16
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,533
What I need you
to know is,

17
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,669
I'm alive,
and I'm in trouble.

18
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,339
Open new file.

19
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,209
Atom project,
update Gamma.

20
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:48,080
This will be miniaturization
test number one.

21
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,683
Execute.

22
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,419
Why can't anything ever work
the first time?

23
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,521
Hmm?

24
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,366
All right, guys,
I know it's been a long haul

25
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,935
figuring out
your platform,

26
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,536
but the good news is,
we're almost done.

27
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,405
Just two more things here
on the docket.

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,407
Mmm, actually, only one.

29
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,609
I figured out where
we're going to hold Ollie's fundraiser.

30
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,478
It's going to be at Gerard's.

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,545
From what I remember,

32
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,280
that place
is a little pricey,

33
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,583
leading us to our
last talking point, the budget.

34
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,750
You have it, right?

35
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,285
If by "you,"
you mean Felicity,

36
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,553
then, yes. She was
supposed to be here,

37
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,155
but she's
just been slammed

38
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,790
at Palmer Tech
for the past few days.

39
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,292
She's really taking
this whole CEO thing seriously.

40
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,795
Well, one of us has to have a job
that actually makes money.

41
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,830
I'll speak with her,
I'll get those numbers for you.

42
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,366
Alex, thank you so much
for all your hard work.

43
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,301
I'll see you later.

44
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,639
I was thinking,

45
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,940
maybe we should
check out Gerard's tomorrow night.

46
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,308
You know,
just to make sure

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,476
it's the right type
of venue

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,944
for introducing
our candidate.

49
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,248
Are you asking me out
on a date?

50
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,316
To be honest,

51
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,086
it's been so long,
I don't even know.

52
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,623
I just am--my life is
really complicated right now,

53
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,260
and I don't think going on a date
with my brother's campaign manager

54
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,961
is going to make it
any easier.

55
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,198
No, you're right.
That was totally unprofessional;

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,300
something I would
normally never do.

57
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,369
I just...
Thought there was something there.

58
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,938
Probably just consumed
a little too much MSG.

59
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,807
How about we just
erase these last five minutes?

60
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,309
Absolutely not.

61
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,178
It was nice.

62
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,880
I'll see you later.

63
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,190
I'm alive,

64
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,892
and I'm in trouble.

65
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,595
I'm alive,

66
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,164
and I'm in trouble.

67
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,366
I'm alive...

68
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,168
I thought I said
you could use my lab

69
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,037
if you clean up
after yourself.

70
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,005
The keyword being "after,"
which assumes finished,

71
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,007
which clearly, I am not.

72
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,210
Well,
how's it going?

73
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,844
Ughh!

74
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,981
That well?

75
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,847
I'm alive...

76
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,349
Do you have that
playing on a loop?

77
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,051
I've been trying
to trace to Ray's message

78
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,886
back to its point of origin,
but he must have ping-ponged it

79
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,888
off of like a thousand servers,
and the back trace algorithm

80
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,723
won't compile, which means
there's no way of finding him, and--

81
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,924
Ok!

82
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,359
You need to stop
right now.

83
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:14,992
I can't.

84
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:16,329
You have to.

85
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,530
You are no good to Mr. Palmer
in your current state.

86
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,864
Now, how long has it been since
you took a break?

87
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,266
I dozed off
for about two minutes

88
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,867
about an hour ago,
does that count?

89
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,905
You're married, he's straight,

90
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,740
you're married,
he's straight, ahem.

91
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,164
Ah, perfect. Oliver Queen,
Curtis Holt. Curtis, Oliver.

92
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,094
Curtis! Felicity's
told me a lot about you.

93
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,981
She's told me
virtually nothing about you.

94
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,549
Ok.

95
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,251
Curtis?

96
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,486
What you doin'?

97
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,955
The Green Arrow
showed up right about the time

98
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,424
that you came back
into town.

99
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,261
Nah, it's not you,
though. Jaw's not right.

100
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,563
That's what I keep
telling people.

101
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,731
Would you give us a minute?

102
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,566
Sure thing.
Nice meeting you.

103
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,269
Nice meeting you, too. Ahem.

104
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,703
Hey.
Hi.

105
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,438
I thought that you were
going to come by

106
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,140
the campaign offices to go
over the finances.

107
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,508
I thought that meeting
was on Wednesday.

108
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,343
It is Wednesday.

109
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,511
Oh.

110
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,580
What's going on?

111
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,681
I'm alive...

112
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,082
And I'm in trouble.

113
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,751
That sounds like--

114
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,680
Ray. Because it is Ray,

115
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,642
because Ray isn't dead.

116
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:16,085
What?

117
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,489
That's impossible.
Ray was--

118
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,057
Killed. In an explosion
that blew up the top

119
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,425
of this building
six months ago.

120
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,627
But that's obviously
not what happened,

121
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,995
because he sent
this message six days ago,

122
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,764
and dead people
don't generally do that.

123
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,599
Ray's alive.
He's out there somewhere.

124
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,000
I have to help him,

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,641
Why didn't you ever tell us about
this place before?

126
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,710
I didn't know
it was here.

127
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,111
But it sort of seems
like you did.

128
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,881
I know this island
isn't all that it seems.

129
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,816
You've done well, Mr. Queen.

130
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,685
But you let the British guy
get away.

131
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,587
Whoa, wait. Reiter.

132
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,890
Constantine said that
there was some sort of

133
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,293
barrier, like magic.

134
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,829
I have no interest
in the chamber.

135
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,604
What is that?

136
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,708
A message,
from the ancients,

137
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,244
leading to a very
special gift.

138
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,648
A heart of water.

139
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,851
Have you seen a cove
on the island,

140
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,339
surrounded by mountains?

141
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,151
Yeah, I know of one.

142
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,656
I want you to go to that point
and lead an excavation.

143
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,658
Take a dozen of the laborers
and work them

144
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,294
until you find my gift.

145
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,363
Can I talk
to you for a sec?

146
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,535
All right, first,

147
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,938
what aren't you telling me
about what we're doing here?

148
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,841
I mean, apart from everything.

149
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,038
And second?

150
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:45,611
Queen is a mole.

151
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,214
Don't start trusting him just 'cause
he gave you a piece of bling.

152
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,086
Accompany Mr. Queen
to the cove.

153
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,564
I know.

154
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,900
I know.

155
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,969
I love you, too, Mom.

156
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,904
I love you so much.

157
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,240
Ok, bye, Mom.

158
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,209
How'd that go?

159
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,978
Easier than the last time

160
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
mom found out
that I wasn't dead.

161
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,550
Hey.

162
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,352
You ok, honey?

163
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,555
Yeah, fine. It was
just something mom said

164
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,793
about how I got lost when I was walking
home from school once,

165
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,062
and--and how I promised
that I'd always come back.

166
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,832
But I can't remember.

167
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,201
You're probably
better off not remembering

168
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,703
all the messed up things
our parents did to us, anyway.

169
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,639
Hey, you two turned out
perfectly, all right,

170
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,441
and more importantly,
you're both home.

171
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,910
I couldn't ask
for anything more.

172
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,881
I tell you Ray's in trouble
and your first response is,

173
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,374
you need a shower.

174
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,418
And a nap.

175
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,052
You're not going
to be able to help--

176
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,987
Oh, stop. You're starting
to sound like Curtis.

177
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,290
Well, Curtis
is a smart guy.

178
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,460
Did Ray's message indicate
what kind of trouble he's in?

179
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,628
If it did, it would have been
the first thing I told you.

180
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,898
Ok. Is there anything
that I can do to help?

181
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,733
Well, have you magically
learned to code

182
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,359
in the last 72 hours?

183
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:18,003
No.

184
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,318
It was a rhetorical question.

185
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:21,342
I know.

186
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,944
I will, however,

187
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,147
accept your undying
support and backrub.

188
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,616
You can have
both as soon as you...

189
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,625
Shower.

190
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:34,019
And take a nap.

191
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,854
Come on.

192
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,088
Come on, come on.

193
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,759
What?

194
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,061
I set an alert just in case
the back trace program

195
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,029
ever finished compiling.

196
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,490
Felicity...

197
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:47,155
Two seconds!

198
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:50,301
It's been
taking forever.

199
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,805
What are you doing?

200
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,773
Absolutely nothing.

201
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,811
Felicity, Felicity,
is that you?

202
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,179
Oh,
my God, Ray!

203
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,165
Ray, where are you?

204
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,015
I don't know.

205
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,550
And if that wasn't enough,
I think I'm being held against my will.

206
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,951
What?!

207
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,286
Yeah, they want my suit,
or at least the tech.

208
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,654
The good news is,
the tech is

209
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,289
useless to them
in my current condition.

210
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,424
Ray, if you have your suit, then
why don't you just--

211
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,127
Bust my way out?
Yeah, that's not really happening.

212
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,896
What, the suit
doesn't work?

213
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,999
Actually, it worked
a little too well.

214
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,230

216

They want my suit,
or at least the tech.

217
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,334
The only good news is,
the tech is useless

218
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,469
to them in
my current condition.

219
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,852
John is never
going to believe this.

220
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:43,596
Neither is Thea.

221
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,887
And, well, Ray is--

222
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,755
the size of a tater tot.

223
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:48,724
Ray modified his suit
with the same nanites

224
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,526
I injected into him
after bad arrow shot him.

225
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:53,329
It's a long story involving
a lot of molecular physics.

226
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,763
The bottom line is that Ray

227
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,765
jury-rigged a short-range
message burst

228
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,034
that was intercepted
by whoever's holding him captive.

229
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:00,736
Ray thinks they want the suit
for its technology,

230
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,237
but they can't use
it while its small.

231
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,906
And while he's small,
it's like looking

232
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,275
for a needle
in a city of haystacks.

233
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:08,344
Ray has something
he thinks could help.

234
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,512
Back at Palmer Tech,
I've got schematics for a machine

235
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:13,849
that should be able
to resize me.

236
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,417
Well, now that
you're both filled in...

237
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,819
Where
are you going?

238
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,204
To Palmer Tech
to pull up the schematics

239
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:18,869
for Ray's device.

240
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,557
I'll come with you.

241
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,990
Why? Are you going
to build the thing?

242
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,425
No.

243
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:25,994
There must be
some other way I can help.

244
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,230
There isn't.

245
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,173
This isn't over,
you know.

246
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:39,775
You and me.

247
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:42,478
I'm so glad.

248
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,315
We need to get
a couple people in the water.

249
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,884
Dive down,
see what you can find.

250
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:51,720
Everyone is tired.
We've been here for hours.

251
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,556
If you want them to work,
they have to be able to.

252
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,458
Are you their leader?

253
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,461
I'm the guy telling you
to let them rest.

254
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:00,896
Ok.

255
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,531
You brought food.

256
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,367
Take 15 minutes and eat.

257
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,971
Well, ain't you
employer of the month.

258
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,973
I'm going to need
you to keep an eye on them,

259
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:14,276
and I'm going to go enjoy
my lunch in peace.

260
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:23,919
Hey, Ukraine.

261
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,821
My name is Vlad.

262
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:29,291
Well, Vlad,

263
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:32,294
how'd you like
your life to get a little better?

264
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:37,332
Doctor Palmer got
miniaturization to work.

265
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,201
He made the space
between atoms shrink.

266
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:41,970
I mean, this is like solving cold fusion
and ultimate theory.

267
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:43,939
Do you have any idea
how amazing this is?

268
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,974
Yes. But the fact
that Ray is being held hostage

269
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,743
and could be killed
at any moment

270
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:50,012
because he is the size of a Cheeto
has dampened my enthusiasm

271
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,914
somewhat.
Can you build this?

272
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,216
Yes. Um, all the materials
are here at Palmer Tech,

273
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,886
um, except for that.

274
00:10:57,888 --> 00:10:59,555
That is a quantum manifold.

275
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,023
Never heard of it.
Where do we get one?

276
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,724
Only one place--
the manufacturer.

277
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:04,359
They hold the patent on it--
well, actually, 16 patents.

278
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:06,395
Where?!

279
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,897
Kord industries. I'd ask them to do us
a solid and loan it to us, but...

280
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,866
They're our
biggest competitor.

281
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:13,202
The good news is,
things can't get any worse.

282
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,039
You just had to go
and say that.

283
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,242
There you are!

284
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,110
Mom. Oh.

285
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,313
Ha ha ha!

286
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,348
Whee!

287
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,817
Oh, what are you
doing here?

288
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:32,421
Well, I went to your office,
Miss CEO,

289
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,590
and your assistant
told me you'd be here.

290
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:37,092
So...here I am.

291
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:39,561
Not here-here,
Star City here.

292
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:42,898
Well, Oliver told me
that you've been working nonstop

293
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,800
this past month,
so I suggested

294
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:45,817
a visit from your mom--

295
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,602
Uh-huh.

296
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,247
Is exactly what you needed,
and guess what?

297
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:48,810
What?

298
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:49,569
He agreed.

299
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:50,472
Oh.

300
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,174
Oh, hi.

301
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,942
And who are you?

302
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:54,657
Oh.

303
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,344
Hi.

304
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,012
I'm Curtis Holt.

305
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,115
It is an absolute
pleasure to meet you.

306
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:58,410
Oh!

307
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:01,783
I can see where Felicity
got her, uh...

308
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:03,819
Blonde hair.

309
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:07,456
Well, she dyes it,
actually.

310
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,625
So, what do you want
to do first?

311
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:12,094
A trip to the mall,
mani-pedi.

312
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,229
You know what, you must be exhausted
from your flight.

313
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:15,964
Why don't I get a car to take you
back to my place?

314
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:18,800
A car? No, baby, I--
I came here to see you.

315
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,036
I know! And you will.
It's just that, right now,

316
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:22,971
Curtis and I are trying to figure out
how to build a very important

317
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:24,506
piece of equipment,
or someone could die.

318
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:27,409
Die?
Metaphorically speaking!

319
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,645
You start constructing the machine,
and I will get you the manifold.

320
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,280
But it's proprietary!
How are you going to do that?

321
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,016
I'm not!

322
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,283
Awesome.

323
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,484
The Green Arrow's going
to be kicking some ass tonight.

324
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,853
If I don't
kick his first.

325
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,589
I thought it would be
a good thing.

326
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:41,823
A good thing?

327
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,458
What on earth made
you agree to this?

328
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,826
Well, you know,
your mom doesn't really

329
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:46,003
take no for an answer.

330
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:46,829
You've faced down

331
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,764
Mirakuru soldiers
and the League of Assassins.

332
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:51,033
Are you honestly telling me that
you couldn't say no to my mom?

333
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:53,435
She said she missed you
and then she texted me

334
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:55,070
one of those emojis
with the single tear.

335
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:57,005
You have been texting
with my mother?!

336
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,107
How long has that
been going on?

337
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:00,676
You guys think we can
find a better time to fight about this?

338
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:03,579
John? I thought only
Oliver's line was open.

339
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,113
Nope. Mine is open.

340
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,348
And mine.

341
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,649
I don't remember
there being

342
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:10,552
so much chatter
on these missions.

343
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:12,821
Are you ok?

344
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,723
Yeah.

345
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,358
I need a little normal.

346
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,827
And for me, this is the kind of
thing that passes.

347
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,929
I hacked
the security panel,

348
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,664
but it needs to be accessed
from the inside.

349
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,333
Only problem is that
the building's interior

350
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,001
is protected by pressure
sensitive flooring,

351
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:28,003
which means Chatty
Kathy, you're up.

352
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,705
Chatty Kathy?
Your new code name,

353
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,506
the only one appropriate
enough I could think of

354
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:33,275
to use
in polite company.

355
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,643
Once the loading dock's
doors are open,

356
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,178
you'll have 90 seconds
to find the manifold

357
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,180
and amscray before
men with guns show up.

358
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,915
Chatty Kathy?

359
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,650
You know, when I get back,

360
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:44,720
you and I are
going to have a talk.

361
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,464
I'm at the panel.

362
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,766
Stand by.

363
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,334
Punch in 4, 5, 8, 7.

364
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:06,141
90 seconds, clock's running.

365
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,844
Are you sure it was a good idea
to bring Sara along?

366
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,646
She'll be fine.

367
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,280
Something's wrong.

368
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:14,282
The security cameras
are coming back online.

369
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,451
I've got it.

370
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,889
No, don't you understand?!

371
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,290
If Kord upgraded
their security,

372
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,126
they probably improved
their response time.

373
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,768
Wait, I think this is it.

374
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,618
Sara, stop!

375
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,952
Sara!

376
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:54,790
Sara!

377
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,863
We have to go.

378
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:10,872
We're clear.

379
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:16,378
Hello?

380
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,879
Is anyone there?

381
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,147
Ray...

382
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,816
Any luck with
the schematics?

383
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,018
I realize the quantum manifold
could present a challenge.

384
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,453
Nothing a little
late night shopping

385
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,555
at Kord industries
couldn't solve.

386
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:28,023
Oh, that's great.
Thank you, Felicity.

387
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,459
Now we just have
to figure out how to--

388
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,327
Ray,
you still there?

389
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,070
Oh, no.

390
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,988
What happened out there?

391
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,581
Sara, she, um...

392
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,949
Had a moment
with the security guard.

393
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,118
Laurel and Thea
took her home.

394
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,887
Are you sure it was Darhk that
you saw in Ray's camera?

395
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,123
Just as sure as I am
that Ray is not getting out of this!

396
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,591
It's actually good
that Darhk has Ray.

397
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,627
This would be the same
level of delusion

398
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,795
that made you think my mother coming
to town would make me feel better?

399
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,464
Because it's Darhk,
that means that

400
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,504
we have an asset.

401
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:07,466
Lance.

402
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,600
I'll ask him to get
us a location.

403
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,068
And what if between
then and now,

404
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,137
Darhk decides to squish Ray
underneath his shoe?

405
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,273
If Darhk wanted to hurt Ray,
he would have done it by now.

406
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:15,741
Dig's right.
We stay focused.

407
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,510
We get Curtis the manifold,
keep him working,

408
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,811
and we unfortunately
just have to wait

409
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,179
and see what
Lance finds out.

410
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,448
I hate waiting and seeing.

411
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,050
I have to do something.

412
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,019
Your mother's in town, spend
some time with her.

413
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:30,455
We could do dinner.
I'll cook.

414
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,157
You already made
dinner plans with my mother,

415
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,358
didn't you?

416
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,193
What? No.

417
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:37,322
Yes.

418
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:38,531
Oh! Oh, my God!

419
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:40,265
It is like a sickness with you!

420
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,167
It wasn't intentional.
We were having a nice conversation;

421
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,802
the subject
turned to cooking,

422
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:46,772
I mentioned that I make a spectacular
chicken cordon bleu.

423
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:50,008
She said she'd never had
one. It's just dinner.

424
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,843
He's right,
Felicity.

425
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,911
Besides, you look
like you haven't...

426
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,513
eaten or slept.

427
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:58,016
A man's life,
a friend's life

428
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,485
is in danger.

429
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,288
Doesn't seem like
the right time for cordon bleu.

430
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,991
I promise you that
there is nothing that we can do

431
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:09,428
until we get what we need
from Lance and Curtis.

432
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,029
So, dinner.

433
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,464
7:00 pm.
I'll be there

434
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,865
as soon as I'm done
with Lance.

435
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,585
Nice instincts.

436
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,388
I wasn't sure
you were coming back.

437
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,058
Well...I said
that I would.

438
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,930
I guess it's
no surprise to you,

439
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:48,133
but I have lost faith
in people doing what

440
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,501
they said they're going to do.

441
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,837
Do you notice
Reiter interested

442
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,806
in anything other than
the camp or drugs?

443
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,875
Yeah. He also enjoys

444
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,177
stealing people
away from their families.

445
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,413
Well, have you seen
him do anything, uh, mystical,

446
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:06,251
or even...
magical?

447
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,221
He always has been
a little odd.

448
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:10,555
And very religious.

449
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,525
He's even blessed
some of the prisoners.

450
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,361
Claims he's healed
their souls or some craziness.

451
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,696
I'm
beginning to think

452
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,064
that drugs
are just a front

453
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,632
for what he's
really doing here.

454
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:21,833
What could be more tempting

455
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,503
to a man like him than money?

456
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,937
Power.

457
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,939
I can't stay long.

458
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,509
I can't have Conklin
being any more suspicious of me

459
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,812
than he already is,
but you still need to stay here.

460
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,580
I'll come back
as much as I can.

461
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,950
This time, I believe you.

462
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:46,425
Heh, I thought it was
past time that we met.

463
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:50,262
My engineers have had no success
in restoring you to your proper size,

464
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:53,165
so I thought I'd appeal
to your cooperation.

465
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,133
And what do I get
if I help you out?

466
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,635
Apart from
probably death.

467
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,570
No.

468
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,939
I don't think it's your life
you should be worried about.

469
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,814
I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.

470
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:11,183
And who is this
"Felicity," I wonder?

471
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:12,651
Certainly not your
former vice-president,

472
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,619
current CEO, girlfriend.

473
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,021
Don't you touch her.

474
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:18,190
Don't make empty threats.

475
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:20,459
It's...

476
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:21,793
small.

477
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,161
Oh, and by the way,

478
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,230
we weren't listening
for a distress call

479
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,632
from a dead man. It was pure luck,
really, that we intercepted

480
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,368
your message.
But isn't luck

481
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,705
just another word
for destiny?

482
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,316
Sorry I'm late.

483
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,485
I, um, I tried
following the recipe,

484
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:49,187
but, you know, I think your oven
might be broken,

485
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,589
because I was supposed
to put in for like 20 minutes,

486
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,390
and, I don't know,

487
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,825
smoke just started
billowing out,

488
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,827
and I think the chicken's
just a little,

489
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,362
slightly undercooked.

490
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,498
I think the technical
term is raw.

491
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,032
It's--it's fine,
it's fine.

492
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,968
I'm home now.
I'll whip something up.

493
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,670
'Cause you just always
fix everything.

494
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,205
A man who cooks.

495
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,207
You put a ring
on that.

496
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,676
How'd that very important
doctor's appointment go, hon?

497
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,678
Uh, good, yes.

498
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,583
Dr. Lance is just
going to find out where the pain

499
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,437
is coming from.

500
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,460
Pain? You ok, hon?

501
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,522
Fine. I'm just
trying to figure out

502
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:24,923
what I've done wrong.

503
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,997
I...

504
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:35,433
I'm going to go
get some take-out.

505
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,304
The best part about arguing
is the make-up sex.

506
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,712
Ok.

507
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,714
Inviting your mother
for a surprise visit

508
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,116
wasn't the best idea.

509
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:52,784
I totally accept that.

510
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,253
What I'm not accepting,
or understanding,

511
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,988
is just you
shutting me out.

512
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,257
I am not shutting you out.

513
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,959
I'm trying to focus
on finding Ray,

514
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:03,595
but I can't do that
with all of these distractions.

515
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,430
Distractions? What is
going on with you?

516
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,265
You're acting like it's
my fault that Ray--

517
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,733
It's my fault.

518
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,569
What's happening with Ray--

519
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,904
to Ray--is my fault.

520
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,473
Felicity,
it really isn't.

521
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,742
Ray was sending
distress calls

522
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,744
for weeks after the accident.

523
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,780
I wasn't here to receive them

524
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,416
because I was too busy
traveling the world with you.

525
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:27,586
I took the voice's word for it
that no body could be recovered

526
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:31,089
because I was so swept up
in being with you.

527
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,792
I'm sorry.

528
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,796
It was my choice
to uproot my entire life,

529
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,900
leave my home and my job,
which turns out, I am very good at.

530
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,803
I lost myself in you,

531
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,472
and I was never that girl.

532
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,508
That girl who just
loses herself in a guy.

533
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,378
That is not who I am.

534
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,681
This isn't about Ray.

535
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,986
It's about us.

536
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,321
No.

537
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,292
Yes.

538
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,296
I don't know.

539
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,264
Ok.

540
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:17,002
I'm going to give you some space
until you figure it out.

541
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,844
It says the traffic
cameras are online.

542
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,346
Yeah, you got to give it
a minute to upload.

543
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,849
What are you
doing here, anyway?

544
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:50,085
I thought I was waiting
for Lance and you were

545
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:52,654
having dinner
with the Smoak ladies.

546
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:53,955
Went that well, did it?

547
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,191
Do you know what I miss
about our old space?

548
00:22:56,193 --> 00:23:00,529
That trunk, with the bottle
of Russian vodka in it.

549
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:04,733
Vodka...

550
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:06,134
is for wimps, anyway.

551
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,569
Vodka
is for wimps?

552
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:08,737
Tennessee whiskey.

553
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,605
Put some hair on your chest.

554
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,941
It's hard to imagine dinner
with Felicity and her mother

555
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:15,244
not going well.

556
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:20,974
Donna's not the problem.

557
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,186
I am. Felicity says that she's
lost herself

558
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:27,589
in our relationship, which means
that she doesn't know who she is,

559
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:32,060
and that if we hadn't have left
Star City when we did,

560
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:34,263
she would have been
around to help Ray.

561
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:38,233
Metahumans, magic,
resurrections--

562
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:41,136
I thought I'd seen it all,
but Oliver Queen jealous?

563
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:42,904
I'm not jealous.
I just got to know

564
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:45,740
if Ivy town was as good
as it gets for us,

565
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:47,209
because we've
come back here.

566
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,978
Everything has
just gotten super complicated,

567
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,714
and it just
makes me wonder,

568
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:54,816
why did she choose me?

569
00:23:54,818 --> 00:23:56,818
Oliver, I've heard you say
a lot of crazy things over the years,

570
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,810
but that has to be the prize.

571
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,288
You know what I mean.

572
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,189
It takes me ten minutes
to log into this thing;

573
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,291
Felicity does it
in two seconds,

574
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:05,494
and Ray probably
invented it.

575
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:06,761
Yeah, you're probably right.

576
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:08,731
Except, Felicity
didn't choose Ray.

577
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:11,333
She chose you.

578
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:13,769
Sure, she has
a lot in common with Ray,

579
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,204
but sometimes what looks good
on paper isn't what works in real life.

580
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,573
What if something
happens to him?

581
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:21,276
We don't get him back?

582
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,145
Felicity Smoak
is one of the smartest,

583
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:26,514
most bad ass women
on the planet.

584
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:29,619
She comes through this,
she'll get Ray back.

585
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,052
You seem
pretty sure.

586
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,721
I married a woman
just like that.

587
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,189
Twice, Oliver, twice.

588
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,791
Yes, you did.

589
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,827
Look, man, relationships
have their ups and downs.

590
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:41,429
Sometimes you just have
to give it some time,

591
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,164
a little bit of space.

592
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:47,869
It's Lance.

593
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:49,638
Meeting with Darhk in 20.

594
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,942
You good?

595
00:24:53,944 --> 00:24:55,410
Better.

596
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,145
Thank you.

597
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,588
What the hell?!

598
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:20,389
Appreciate you meeting me.

599
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,334
I know you're a busy man.

600
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:22,705
I am.

601
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:24,639
But I may have found a way
to make this city

602
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:26,459
useful for once.

603
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,507
I don't understand.

604
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,678
Oh, you will.

605
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,779
Everyone in this
city will.

606
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,580
Well, maybe I could
find out sooner than others.

607
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:35,750
My daughter, Sara,
she's, uh, she's back,

608
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:37,285
but, you know,
not all the way.

609
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,688
Something about her
is still a little off.

610
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,290
I assure you,
the relevance escapes me.

611
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,059
Well, I was thinking,
maybe if I could help you

612
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:46,194
a little more, than maybe
you could help me.

613
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,530
You know your way around
this magic mumbo jumbo.

614
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,934
Mumbo jumbo?

615
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:54,769
I'll consider it,
Captain,

616
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:58,707
but this will be the last time
you summon me.

617
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:13,021
John, he just left. He's heading
south down Victoria Street.

618
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:26,334
Yeah?

619
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,036
I brought you some hot milk.

620
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:29,237
I'm not ten, Mom.

621
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:31,139
I'll bring it back
downstairs.

622
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:33,441
No, wait,
wait, wait.

623
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:36,611
Since you went
to all the trouble.

624
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:39,147
Do you remember
when you were a little girl

625
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,783
and I told you you couldn't
go to Space Camp?

626
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:44,152
You locked yourself
in your room for two days.

627
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:46,254
Well, to be fair,
it was Space Camp.

628
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:48,356
But I told you,
I couldn't bear the thought

629
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,292
of sending you away
for eight weeks.

630
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:54,295
The truth was, hon, I...

631
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,700
I couldn't afford it.

632
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,869
Then why didn't you
just tell me that?

633
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,171
Because, I was embarrassed,
you know, that I had no money;

634
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,740
that I had no idea
where your father was,

635
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:09,844
and even if I did, he never paid a dime
in child support, anyway.

636
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:12,614
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

637
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:14,649
I put everything
into your father.

638
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:17,118
My love, my trust,
my twenties.

639
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,188
My point is, you...

640
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,856
are not me.

641
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:24,692
You are the CEO

642
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:26,327
of a bajillion dollar company.

643
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:29,063
And Oliver, he's not
like your father, hon.

644
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,999
He loves you.

645
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:34,369
No one has ever looked at me
the way he looks at you.

646
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:37,605
He's wonderful.

647
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:40,408
In a million
different ways.

648
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,444
But that's the problem.

649
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:44,279
It's too easy

650
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:46,514
to lose myself in him.

651
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:48,817
Baby.

652
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:51,419
That's how
it's supposed to feel

653
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,488
when you love someone.

654
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,490
Believe it or not,

655
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,125
he's lost himself in you.

656
00:27:57,127 --> 00:28:00,128
And you'll find yourself

657
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,096
in each other.

658
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,833
Just don't get
in your own way.

659
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:06,468
And don't ruin something

660
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,204
that most people never get.

661
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:10,791
'Cause if you do, trust me,

662
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,747
you'll never find another
guy that hot again, who cooks.

663
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:27,088
Thanks.

664
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:32,093
He is definitely hiding
something in there.

665
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:33,895
Latin building.
Before the city went to crap,

666
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:36,698
it was touted as the most secure building
on the west coast.

667
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,867
Every access point is protected
by a retinal scanner,

668
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:40,301
and a voice print.

669
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,736
There is no way
we're getting in there.

670
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:43,771
Well, not from
the outside, at least.

671
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:45,707
How's Curtis doing
on the resizing device?

672
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,242
He said he could have
something functional in an hour.

673
00:28:47,244 --> 00:28:49,043
I don't think we have
that kind of time.

674
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:50,845
He's going to have
to assemble it in the field.

675
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:52,614
Wait, with us?

676
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:54,749
Are we sure we want
to have your assistant in on this?

677
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:57,452
It's my employee, actually.
And I'm not sure our company

678
00:28:57,454 --> 00:28:59,220
health plan covers
supernatural dismemberment.

679
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:01,657
We need him. And if
Curtis can re-size Ray on the inside,

680
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,192
then we have another hand
getting us all outside.

681
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:07,128
Then how about one more?

682
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:10,965
I don't think
that's a good idea.

683
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,467
Laurel, I don't know what's
going on with me,

684
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:15,837
but I need to know that
I can control this.

685
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,546
Suit up.

686
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,633
Hmm.

687
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:12,070
These are very nice.

688
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:16,375
Oops.

689
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:19,845
Leave us.

690
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:33,859
Package is delivered.

691
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:40,432
Ladies?

692
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:42,000
Ready.

693
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,035
Felicity?

694
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:44,169
Ready.

695
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,271
Or as ready
as I'll ever be.

696
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:48,006
When I told HR I wanted
a little bit more excitement from my job,

697
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:49,975
this really isn't
what I had in mind.

698
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:51,677
You were the one who said
you wanted to help Ray

699
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,312
and that you were
an accomplished base jumper.

700
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,280
Oh, God, I really do
have too many hobbies.

701
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:57,883
We're all right,
Spartan, let's do this.

702
00:30:57,885 --> 00:30:59,017
Spartan?

703
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:00,819
We have a guest tonight.

704
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:04,189
All right,
disengaging security systems...

705
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:06,091
Now.

706
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:17,336
Oh!

707
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:18,179
You two ok?

708
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:19,706
Uh-huh.

709
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,173
We're not dead.

710
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:22,474
Good.

711
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:24,042
Let's go.

712
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:56,942
You mind
if I take a little

713
00:31:56,944 --> 00:32:00,078
peeksie? I mean,
I have my suspicions, of course.

714
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,348
But I just want to see
if I'm right, as usual.

715
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,962
Didn't you learn anything from
our last go-round?

716
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:19,231
I guess not.

717
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,820
Ray!

718
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:43,255
Hey.

719
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:45,991
How do you open this?

720
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:48,060
My best guess is it needs
an asymmetric cipher.

721
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:50,662
You can open it with five years
and an NSA-grade computer.

722
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:53,398
What if we enlarged him now,
and then use his size to break the cube?

723
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,681
The quantum field won't be able to
penetrate this polymer.

724
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,842
You know, it is a shame
that you won't live

725
00:33:03,844 --> 00:33:06,044
to see the new life
that I breathe into the city.

726
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:09,047
The new life that I breathe
into this world.

727
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:11,550
You won't get
the chance.

728
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:21,994
They put mini-cams
in here with me,

729
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:23,261
and those cameras...

730
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:24,796
Need to draw power
from somewhere.

731
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,431
Ray, you are a genius.

732
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,266
Well, I don't
know about that, but I have

733
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:30,535
siphoned off enough
juice to power up my exo-suit.

734
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:35,440
Dr. Palmer's
doo-hickey's ready.

735
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:36,875
If you don't mind
my use of a technical term.

736
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:38,343
Do it!

737
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,321
I'm not dead.

738
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,851
We got Ray, let's go.

739
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:55,128
Copy that.

740
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:56,862
Don't move!

741
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:02,768
Sara!

742
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,904
No!

743
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:10,709
Come on.
We have to go!

744
00:34:10,711 --> 00:34:12,811
Come on!

745
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:18,750
We have to move.

746
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:21,987
Good to see you, Ray.

747
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,689
Nice suit.

748
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:31,587
The worst part
wasn't being small--

749
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:33,222
it was that everything
else was so big.

750
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:34,657
The explosion
at Palmer Tech

751
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,559
tossed me into an abandoned
construction site.

752
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,294
The cockroaches were the size
of golden retrievers.

753
00:34:38,296 --> 00:34:39,829
I'm not exaggerating.

754
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:41,464
Uh, I think we don't
need to know that, really.

755
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:43,566
Ah, the entomologist in me
was actually really fascinated.

756
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:47,103
I mean, you can't appreciate the size
of the mandibles until the--

757
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:49,138
Mmm, mmm, no,
I've heard enough.

758
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
I got a thing against cockroaches,
and snakes and spiders,

759
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:54,110
but especially
cockroaches.

760
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,444
Sorry, Ray, not
everyone shares

761
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:57,279
your enthusiasm
for bugs.

762
00:34:57,281 --> 00:34:59,448
But it is good to see
the experience didn't change you.

763
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,617
Indeed. I got
your medical tests back,

764
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,120
and aside from a very
noticeable iron deficiency,

765
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:06,355
all your results are positive.
There don't seem to be

766
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:09,492
any side effects
from the, um, micro sizing.

767
00:35:09,494 --> 00:35:10,413
Relieved to hear it.

768
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:11,528
So are we.

769
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:14,130
So, this guy who wanted
to make me his lab rat?

770
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:16,298
Damian Darhk.
He's the leader of an organization

771
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,168
we believe to be
known as HIVE.

772
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,669
Oh, like "Spectre?"

773
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,404
That's so cool!

774
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:23,710
And terrible.

775
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:24,673
Be assured, Palmer,

776
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:26,542
that if they wanted your tech,
it wasn't for any good reason.

777
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:27,977
One other thing--

778
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:30,146
they overheard
my message to you.

779
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:31,847
I'm a possible target.
I figured.

780
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:34,150
I wouldn't be doing this
if I couldn't handle

781
00:35:34,152 --> 00:35:35,684
being threatened
by a super villain

782
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:37,353
every now and then.

783
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:38,787
Come on. I'll take you home.

784
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:40,556
I can catch you up
on all the latest

785
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:41,383
at your company.

786
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:42,384
Uh, actually,

787
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:45,548
until I decide to come
back from the dead,

788
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,861
it's your company.

789
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:48,259
Great.

790
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,143
What in the hell?!

791
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:17,646
You better have a story
to go along with that body.

792
00:36:23,287 --> 00:36:25,121
Look, Thea told me

793
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:27,556
that this was a side
effect of the Pit.

794
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:29,191
And I thought that
I could fight it.

795
00:36:29,193 --> 00:36:30,426
I just...

796
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:32,828
I couldn't
stop myself.

797
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,164
And the worst
part of it was,

798
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,399
I felt better.

799
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:38,634
Look, Sara,
controlling this,

800
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:41,303
it's not going
to come easy, ok?

801
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,605
It's going
to take you some time.

802
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:44,006
And how many bodies?

803
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,841
Look, I respect
the way that

804
00:36:45,843 --> 00:36:47,276
you could deal
with this, Thea,

805
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:50,112
but I need to handle this
in a different way.

806
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:51,580
Different how?

807
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:59,155
Laurel, I owe you
everything.

808
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:03,659
You gave me the greatest gift
that anyone ever could.

809
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:05,928
You gave me
a second chance,

810
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,597
and the ability
to start over.

811
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,000
I think it's time
that I really do that.

812
00:37:11,002 --> 00:37:13,702
But Sara--

813
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:16,005
we just got you back.

814
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:17,807
Sara, you don't
have to leave.

815
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:21,710
I know it doesn't
seem possible right now,

816
00:37:21,712 --> 00:37:23,879
but you can have
a normal life.

817
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,448
It's been
a long time since

818
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,884
my normal has
ever been normal.

819
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:32,087
Look, I'll go visit
mom in Central City,

820
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:34,290
and then, somewhere...

821
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:36,192
Maybe a few
somewheres,

822
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:38,461
just until
I figure things out.

823
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:42,398
If you're sure that
that's what you want to do.

824
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,166
It's your life.

825
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:46,168
And you have to do
what makes you happy.

826
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,539
I'm just really
going to miss you.

827
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:57,880
I love you, sis.

828
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:00,716
Always and forever.

829
00:38:00,718 --> 00:38:03,085
I love you, too.

830
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:10,673
Hey.

831
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:12,279
Hi.

832
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:14,396
How'd it go
with Ray?

833
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:17,766
Fine. Until I told him
I sold his condo.

834
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:22,705
I wanted--
before we--

835
00:38:22,707 --> 00:38:24,073
Oh. Hmm.

836
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:26,609
You go first.

837
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:28,244
No.

838
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:29,378
You.

839
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,448
I think we should...

840
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,183
Clear the air.

841
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:40,389
Um...

842
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:44,226
I wanted
to thank you.

843
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:46,562
For helping save Ray, and for being
so understanding

844
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:48,898
in the midst
of my mini--

845
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,866
gargantuan
freak out.

846
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:54,937
Well, I'm sorry
that I'm not the best listener.

847
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:58,407
But all of this is just, it--

848
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,775
it's kind of new to me.

849
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:01,210
And to me.

850
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:03,245
I didn't
exactly grow up

851
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,080
with the best
example of a normal,

852
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:06,615
healthy
relationship.

853
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:09,785
Line forms behind me.

854
00:39:09,787 --> 00:39:12,421
It's kind of amazing
that we've made it this far.

855
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:14,590
We're going
to be fine.

856
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:17,526
How can you be so sure?

857
00:39:17,528 --> 00:39:20,829
'Cause we found ourselves
in each other.

858
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:50,292
Feeling lonely?

859
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:52,227
You don't even know
the half of it.

860
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:55,764
I might.

861
00:39:58,035 --> 00:39:59,969
I, um,

862
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:03,606
I came to town
to visit my daughter,

863
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:05,641
but she kicked me out
of her apartment

864
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:08,711
to finish a fight
with the man I hope

865
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:12,648
will become my future
son in law.

866
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:16,619
Ok, it's your turn.

867
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:18,654
Well, one of my daughters
is leaving town

868
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:21,590
after being back a whole
five minutes.

869
00:40:21,592 --> 00:40:23,826
Sounds like a reason to drink.

870
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:25,294
Oh, I always
got a reason.

871
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:28,397
But this is
club soda.

872
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:31,800
Quentin.

873
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:36,071
Donna.

874
00:40:46,851 --> 00:40:49,852
Hey, Thea. When
your brother comes in,

875
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:50,915
could you have him sign
these for me, please?

876
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:51,723
Yeah.

877
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,747
You ok?

878
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:55,691
Just a little
stressed out.

879
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:57,926
Maybe, um...

880
00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:00,095
Maybe I need
to get a drink.

881
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:02,898
It's a little early
for a cocktail, but...

882
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,934
Not now. Later?

883
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:08,771
With you,
at Gerard's?

884
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:10,039
But I thought you--

885
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:13,008
I just want to have
a normal life.

886
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,476
Meet me there at 8:00?

887
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:16,545
Yeah, absolutely.

888
00:41:17,915 --> 00:41:20,449
I'll leave these here.

889
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:30,926
Dr. Palmer's
molecular's realignment

890
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:32,327
was premised on a power draw
from our system,

891
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,462
which resulted--

892
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:34,930
Just because
I understand science

893
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:36,231
doesn't mean
I'm not bored by it.

894
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:37,733
Bottom line it for me.

895
00:41:37,735 --> 00:41:39,001
We were able to recover
some residue

896
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:40,936
from Dr. Palmer's
Dwarf Star alloy,

897
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:42,971
and use it to fashion into
a power source.

898
00:41:42,973 --> 00:41:45,374
Good.

899
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:48,610
Test it out.

900
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:51,313
On this.

901
00:41:56,897 --> 00:42:03,397
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

902
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:22,003
Greg!
Move your head.
