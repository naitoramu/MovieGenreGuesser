1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:01,798
This season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:04,504
The only way I know
how to fight the darkness

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,103
is to be darkness,

4
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:08,794
and I don't want to be
that type of person anymore.

5
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:09,674
I'm running for mayor.

6
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:10,907
And I promise you

7
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:12,175
that I will never
stop fighting

8
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,710
to save this city.

9
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:14,945
You're all fretting
about this city dying.

10
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:16,213
I'm here on behalf
of an organization

11
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:18,348
that wants you
to let it die.

12
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,483
I'm Damien Darhk.

13
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:22,385
The type of magic
he's using,

14
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:23,753
I've seen it take
good people

15
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:25,121
and turn them dark.

16
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:26,590
If I don't
make it off this island,

17
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:29,426
you will go to Russia
and find my parents.

18
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,761
If Darhk wins,
Laurel died for nothing.

19
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,931
If you can channel
light and hope,

20
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,101
you will be able
to repel Darhk's magic.

21
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,769
Do you remember
what I promised you?

22
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:40,971
A new beginning.

23
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,339
Darhk plans
to burn the world

24
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:44,174
in a nuclear fire.

25
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:45,909
I'm assuming you know
what Rubicon is.

26
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,978
And I'm assuming it's
under Mr. Darhk's control.

27
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,412
Every NATO Ally--

28
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:51,414
Rubicon has control over
all their nuclear systems.

29
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,682
You mean
HIVE does.

30
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:54,150
If even one
of those nukes hits...

31
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:55,485
He will be
unstoppable.

32
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:56,953
- I think it worked.
- It worked.

33
00:00:56,955 --> 00:01:00,023
Rubicon's offline.
Ha ha ha!

34
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,725
Do you need a moment?

35
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:02,959
No? Good.

36
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,227
Because I need you
to do me a favor.

37
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,662
Go to hell.

38
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:08,331
Why bother?

39
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,167
I'm going to bring it to us.

40
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,137
Get the hell
out of here.

41
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:15,739
Mom, stop.

42
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:18,341
- Oh, my God!
- Mom, get back!

43
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:19,576
This is your mother?

44
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,945
Oh, goodie.

45
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:24,648
Persuading you to help me

46
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,882
is going to be easier
than I thought.

47
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:27,384
Helping you
do what?

48
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,685
Your underground city's
already been destroyed.

49
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:29,886
I'm still going forward.

50
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:31,187
So, what,
you kill my mother

51
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:32,455
if I don't help you
destroy the world?

52
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:34,691
Newsflash--my mother
lives in the world.

53
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,554
Dying instantaneously
in nuclear fire,

54
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,855
rather painless,

55
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,724
and then there's
having your life force

56
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,027
slowly sucked out
like this.

57
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:46,496
Mom!

58
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:49,132
What's it going to be,
miss Smoak?

59
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:57,240
Look. I know you don't
live here anymore,

60
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,743
but those were
nice windows.

61
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,245
So unoriginal.

62
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,081
I am now powered
by the deaths

63
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,517
of tens of thousands
of souls.

64
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,687
There is nothing
you can do to stop me...

65
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:14,524
Or should I say, "us."

66
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,955
Stop!

67
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,391
You let them go,

68
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:51,561
or I kill
your daughter.

69
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:54,698
Do you think
I'm bluffing?

70
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,769
Let my daughter go.

71
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,272
It's ok, sweetheart.

72
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:04,908
Everything's going
to be all right.

73
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:11,915
Are you ok?

74
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,783
When did this
become your life?

75
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,585
Oh, my God!

76
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,557
Oh, my God,
it's gone.

77
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,250
He took it.
It's gone.

78
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:21,833
What's gone?

79
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,100
The laptop with
the anti-Rubicon program.

80
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,701
If Darhk has that...

81
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:26,970
He can launch all of the world's
nuclear missiles.

82
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:30,994

Looks like
internal bleeding.

85
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,353
Possibly broken ribs.

86
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,556
Hemothorax.

87
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,792
We have to relieve
the pressure. Thea.

88
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,461
Felicity, we need you
at your station.

89
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,598
We have to stop Rubicon.

90
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,167
Is he going to be ok?

91
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,105
Put the gun down,
Reiter.

92
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,340
Aah!

93
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,608
Oh!

94
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,309
You think you can kill me,
miss Venediktov?

95
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,844
I am going to kill you.

96
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,880
You'll only kill
yourself in the attempt.

97
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,416
Without these runes,

98
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,118
the idol's power would
overwhelm my mind.

99
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,353
I don't care.

100
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,522
It's worth it to stop you.

101
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,756
See that, Reiter?

102
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,359
That plane filled
with all those people

103
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,027
you were keeping
prisoner?

104
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,962
They're getting away.
This is over!

105
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,998
That's not all of them,
Mr. Queen.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,866
The plane's too small.

107
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,302
And it's not over.

108
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,171
Ohh!

109
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,006
All those deaths,

110
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,641
they give me power,

111
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,344
and her...Only madness.

112
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,046
Aah!

113
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,849
How is he?

114
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,284
Well, he's stable.

115
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,552
John said the next 30 minutes
should tell us...

116
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,853
Whether or not
he'll make it?

117
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,054
Yeah.

118
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,322
Hey, can I ask you
something?

119
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,790
I know it might not
be the best time.

120
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,225
Back at our place--
my place--

121
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,860
the--the place--
the loft...

122
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,061
Yeah.

123
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,763
Darhk's magic,
it worked on you.

124
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,997
I thought--

125
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,232
you thought I found
a way to stop it.

126
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,202
That was before
he grew so powerful.

127
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,837
It was the--

128
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,674
the hope you had in me
was able to counteract his magic.

129
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,144
And now my hope's
not enough.

130
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,147
So where are we?

131
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,882
Um, good news,
bad news time.

132
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,853
Good news is is that Darhk hasn't
launched the nukes yet.

133
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,221
I think his hacker's
still trying

134
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,455
to break our failsafes.

135
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,857
Ok, and the bad news?

136
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,258
Well, the bad news is
that with Rubicon offline,

137
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,559
there is nothing
for me to hack into.

138
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,361
Right, but your laptop
has to have a GPS--

139
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,762
- yeah.
- I'm sure that you've already

140
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,030
started to try and do it.

141
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,233
Yeah.

142
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,701
I thought you'd
shut Rubicon down.

143
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,936
Felicity is working
on locating the laptop.

144
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,204
Where's Sara?

145
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,439
She's fine.

146
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,242
She's in an Argus bunker
in Coast City.

147
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,510
With Darhk's anti-nuke
bunker destroyed,

148
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,612
why is he moving
forward with Genesis?

149
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,913
Machin killed his wife.

150
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,214
Well, his daughter still
lives in this world.

151
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,449
He must know that.

152
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,284
He knows, he just--
he doesn't care.

153
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,552
He's lost all hope.

154
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,786
Yeah, just like
all of us.

155
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,388
Wait. I thought he
was the cynic.

156
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,423
It's not like John doesn't have
a point, Thea.

157
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,125
We are not finished yet.

158
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,426
The key word
being "yet."

159
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,694
I got a 20
on the laptop.

160
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,062
Downtown, abandoned
office building.

161
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,931
Let's move.

162
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,743
Overwatch,
there's no one here.

163
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,977
That's impossible.

164
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,279
You're right on top
of the GPS signal.

165
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
She's right.

166
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,030
Oh, my God.

167
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,532
Overwatch.

168
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,767
I see it.

169
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,268
Just over 15,000
ballistic missiles,

170
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,603
and they all just launched.

171
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,837
How much time do we have?

172
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,105
Two hours.

173
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,341
Maybe less.

174
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:03,214
Confirmed.
15,434 birds in the air.

175
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:04,893
We need to set
defense condition one

176
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,563
and get the president
down to the PEOC.

177
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:08,241
Felicity.

178
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:09,508
He's got me
completely locked out.

179
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,743
Ok, how many
missiles are there?

180
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:12,010
DOD's
working on it,

181
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:13,245
but the targets
are worldwide.

182
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,546
You said that we
have two hours.

183
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:15,748
The world has two hours,

184
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,015
but I'm tracking
a Minuteman ICBM

185
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,684
heading straight
for Star City.

186
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:19,985
It just launched out
of Warren Air Force Base in Colorado.

187
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:21,220
Ok, well, that's close.

188
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:23,388
Which means we only
have 45 minutes.

189
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,250
Taiana.

190
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:52,484
I'm ok.

191
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:56,355
I think...I'm ok.

192
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:57,823
Taiana?

193
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:00,926
All right,
where's the fire?

194
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:03,595
What's this?

195
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:04,863
The safest place
within 100 miles

196
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,131
to survive a nuclear attack.

197
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,332
Based on wind patterns--

198
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

199
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:09,835
What are you
talking about?

200
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,303
The world is going
to end in two hours.

201
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:13,105
I need you to take
my mother there.

202
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,339
Can you do that?

203
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,642
Yeah, I will.

204
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,782
Sara, on phone:
Bye, daddy. Bye, mama.

205
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:25,150
We'll see you
soon, sweetie.

206
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:26,685
I love you, baby girl.

207
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,492
Argus has a chopper waiting
to take us to Coast City,

208
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:37,062
so at least we'll
all be together.

209
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:39,965
If we can't stop the...

210
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,700
The end of the world.

211
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:44,169
In these situations,

212
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,506
you're usually the one
offering hope.

213
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:48,974
I'm fresh out, Lyla.

214
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,976
Because of what
happened with Andy?

215
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:52,845
It was self-defense, John.

216
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:55,514
It was a clean kill.

217
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:57,182
Lyla.

218
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:59,151
Are you having Argus
move on city hall?

219
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:01,687
John told me the source
of Darhk's power is there,

220
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,555
that he might be looking
to harness the deaths

221
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:04,790
from the nuclear attacks.

222
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,058
No, he's already
done that

223
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,292
with the first attack.

224
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:09,061
He will decimate
your team.

225
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:10,529
You should
pull them back.

226
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,797
And what if his hacker's
down there with him?

227
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,165
Cooper Seldon is not
going to be anywhere

228
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,366
that we think to look.

229
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:15,634
He'll be in a secure
location.

230
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:18,503
If your team
goes down there,

231
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:19,705
they will all die.

232
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:21,106
It's not your call,
Oliver.

233
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:23,408
It's mine.

234
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,785
I don't like
this place.

235
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,054
It's scary.

236
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,990
Hey...

237
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:42,027
It's just a little bit
longer, sweetheart.

238
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,429
I miss mommy.

239
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:50,936
I do, too.

240
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:55,240
But we're going
to see her soon.

241
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,390
Assault team sledgehammer

242
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:12,591
has engaged target.

243
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,593
Switching you
to their feed now.

244
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:33,312
Turn it off.

245
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,253
Those missiles hit,

246
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:42,821
and he's going to become
even stronger, isn't he?

247
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:45,190
He already is with the souls
of all of those Argus agents

248
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,458
that he just killed.

249
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,260
Wait.

250
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,527
I'm in. I'm through
Cooper's firewalls.

251
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,762
Well, shut it down.

252
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:51,630
That's what
I'm trying to--

253
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,626
Aah!

254
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:27,098
Look at me.
Listen to me.

255
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,001
Don't let it
control your mind.

256
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,372
Yaah!

257
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:36,741
You are a murderer.

258
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:38,743
You killed my brother.

259
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:41,279
You are darkness.

260
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:43,581
Yes...I am...

261
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,385
But you--you don't
have to be.

262
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,457
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,692
It's ok.

264
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:56,628
I can feel it
burning my mind.

265
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,464
Taiana, we will find a way

266
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,666
to work around this.

267
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:05,270
There is only one way.

268
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:12,377
You have to kill me,
Oliver.

269
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,246
With Mayor Adams
missing and presumed dead,

270
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:17,482
Deputy Mayor Remz
called for calm

271
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:19,384
in the wake
of unconfirmed reports

272
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:22,787
that a nuclear attack
on our city is imminent.

273
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,622
Newly assigned police captain
Frank Pike asks...

274
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,958
Just when things
couldn't get any worse.

275
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,426
Is everyone all right?

276
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,627
I think "all right"
is a relative term.

277
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:30,995
How much time
do we have?

278
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:32,230
I think 27 minutes.

279
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,099
It's kind of hard
to tell now.

280
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,736
I wonder what Laurel would
have thought of all this.

281
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:39,237
Well, she probably would
have said something

282
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:43,007
about finding a solution
no matter what.

283
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,778
Yeah. She's always
stubborn like that.

284
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,813
Too bad she would have
been wrong this time.

285
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:50,014
Hey, come on.

286
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:51,983
We can't just lose
all hope here.

287
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:53,518
You have.

288
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:58,656
I can see it
in your eyes.

289
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:03,161
I just can't believe
that I thought

290
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:05,964
that I'd be the one
to unite this city

291
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:09,868
while Damien Darhk
was trying to kill it.

292
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,970
That was arrogant.

293
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,371
It was the same arrogance

294
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:16,141
that made me feel like
I could be the Green Arrow

295
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:18,009
without descending
into darkness.

296
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,245
Bottom line,
it was foolish.

297
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:21,513
You don't believe that.

298
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:23,848
I didn't believe that...

299
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,483
Until Laurel died.

300
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:26,751
I thought you weren't
blaming yourself

301
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,019
for her death anymore.

302
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:31,890
We made a decision
to come back here.

303
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:33,892
I tried to do things
differently,

304
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:36,828
and for a time, I did.

305
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:46,571
And now I am left here
to wonder if I hadn't,

306
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:50,074
would Laurel
still be alive?

307
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,444
Curtis.

308
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:54,712
You shouldn't be up.

309
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,081
Tell me about it.

310
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,717
Someone's got to provide
a little optimism.

311
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:02,353
Doesn't seem like
anyone around here

312
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:03,588
is in the head-space
to do it.

313
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,290
Then you know we've
lost the city.

314
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,358
No.

315
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,795
I know that you're running
out of time to get it back.

316
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,630
Look.

317
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,199
Living in Star City

318
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:17,101
requires a special
kind of tenacity.

319
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,938
A sane person
wouldn't live here.

320
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,708
It's a fact that Paul likes
to remind me of weekly.

321
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,045
We were this close
to leaving Star City last October.

322
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:31,850
After 3 terrorist attacks,
we were done,

323
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:36,888
but then the night
before we were going to start packing,

324
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,191
the Green Arrow
popped up on our TV,

325
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:42,327
and he reminded me
that this city

326
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,429
is worth saving,

327
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,865
that my home--

328
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:51,736
that my home was
worth fighting for.

329
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,275
That guy gave me
inspiration.

330
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:59,878
He gave me hope.

331
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,647
And if he could
give me hope then,

332
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:07,151
why can't he give it
to others now?

333
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:19,163
Hey, stop!

334
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:22,600
Stop!

335
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,802
Please.

336
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:27,639
I know what you're
feeling right now.

337
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,808
I'm feeling it, too,

338
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,278
the sense of--
of helplessness,

339
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,747
of hopelessness.

340
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:39,817
I don't know
how we even begin

341
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,621
to process what might
happen to us right now,

342
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:46,925
but there are a few things
that I do know.

343
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,894
I know that this city
has been through

344
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:51,529
tough times before,

345
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:54,098
and we have pulled
through.

346
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,535
We survived
the Undertaking.

347
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:59,971
We survived the Siege.

348
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:01,673
We survived
the Outbreak,

349
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,842
and somehow, someway,

350
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:07,912
we will survive this.

351
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:09,814
A friend of mine told me

352
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:12,784
that living in Star City,

353
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:15,853
it takes a special kind
of tenacity,

354
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:19,991
but we do live here,

355
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:23,361
because this is our home.

356
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:27,465
This is our home!

357
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:32,003
It is our friend,
our family, our lives,

358
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:34,672
and we will not--
we will not

359
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:37,675
throw those precious
gifts away

360
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:40,878
by descending into chaos.

361
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,982
We will look
to each other for hope.

362
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:46,951
We will cling to each other
for strength,

363
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:49,053
and if we do that,

364
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,189
no matter what happens,

365
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:56,427
then we can all
stand here united.

366
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:00,198
Oh, my God. It's here.

367
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,033
That's terrifying...

368
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,835
And also kind of great.

369
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:05,370
I think you got hit
on the head harder

370
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:06,871
than you realize.

371
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:08,373
No, no, he's right.
I can't hack this system.

372
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,907
But if the nuke
gets close enough, which it is...

373
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,542
We could use
the line-of-sight attack

374
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:14,212
on the missile itself
and disarm it.

375
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:15,780
Still not getting a signal.

376
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,048
Are you sure you're pointing
that thing at the nuke?

377
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,282
It's pretty hard
to miss, Felicity.

378
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:19,717
Ok, ok, ok.
I'm just going--oh!

379
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,285
Whatever you changed,
don't change it again.

380
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:22,587
It's working.
I got a signal.

381
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,788
I didn't change anything!

382
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,056
Nukes are designed
to detonate

383
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,391
100 feet above
their actual target.

384
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:27,725
I'm uploading a GPS
spoof to disable it.

385
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,093
Great...

386
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:31,596
But, um, it's still
heading straight for us.

387
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,731
Just keep pointing
the IR receiver at the thingy.

388
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,700
You know, I have
perfect confidence in your abilities.

389
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:36,934
- Thank you.
- But just in case,

390
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:38,369
working with you
and the rest of the team

391
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,637
has been the highlight
of my professional career

392
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:40,972
and my entire life,

393
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:42,273
and--and I can't think
of any better way

394
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,474
for it to end than--

395
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:44,742
Curtis,
as sweet as this is,

396
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:47,578
the talking's
really not helping.

397
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,587
Oh, my God.

398
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,090
Oh, my God,
it worked! Ohh!

399
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:19,679
Whatever you guys just
did was incredible.

400
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,612
We only took down
one nuke.

401
00:19:21,614 --> 00:19:25,683
We still have 15,433
to go, give or take.

402
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:27,251
The code to
the line-of-sight hack,

403
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:28,519
can you distro
it to everybody?

404
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:29,787
I'm on it.

405
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,021
All right, that's one.

406
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:32,256
1 nuke in 15,000.

407
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,524
The chances of us
getting them all is--

408
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:34,759
1 in 375 million.

409
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:35,993
Well, we need to find
Darhk's hacker

410
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:37,294
and shut down Rubicon
at the source.

411
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:38,529
When we disarmed
the nuke,

412
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:39,930
we gained access
to its onboard computer

413
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:41,332
and cloned
its hard drive remotely.

414
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:42,767
Then we ran a back trace
to determine the source

415
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,034
of the initial
launch signal.

416
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:45,302
He's holed up
in a warehouse

417
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:46,804
on the corner
of Cheswold and Crombie.

418
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,005
Let's get after him.

419
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,273
That was quite
a speech, Oliver.

420
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,741
It made me long
for a voting booth.

421
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:52,777
You and Thea need
to back up Curtis and Felicity

422
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:54,011
while they deal
with Seldon.

423
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:55,312
Hey, what are you
going to do?

424
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:56,514
I'm going to city hall.

425
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:57,782
Oliver, you
yourself said

426
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:59,150
going after Darhk
is a suicide mission.

427
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:00,718
Well, John, I'm not
going to die tonight.

428
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,319
Well, let me go
with you, back you up.

429
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:03,521
If things go bad,

430
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:04,822
I need you
to back the city up.

431
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:07,258
Oliver, things aren't
going to go bad.

432
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,727
Your speech...

433
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,463
Inspired all of us, too.

434
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,735
Let's move.

435
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,370
Do it, Oliver.

436
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:21,238
Please, do it quickly.

437
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,740
Taiana.

438
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,041
I'm not going
to kill you--

439
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:25,276
Then I will kill you.

440
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:26,911
Don't you understand?

441
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:28,245
Please!

442
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:31,382
Before I kill whoever
is left on this island,

443
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:35,186
before I become worse
than Reiter, please.

444
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:38,189
Please don't ask
me to do this.

445
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:40,257
If you ever
cared for me,

446
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:44,094
then you would do this.

447
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:54,471
Don't forget
your promise.

448
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:57,074
I won't.

449
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:05,983
Taiana, I'm sorry.

450
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:09,753
It's ok, it's ok.

451
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,897
You killed her!

452
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:28,205
I thought you were
staying behind.

453
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:32,276
Yeah, it doesn't mean
I shouldn't be prepared.

454
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,546
I'm not going to ask
if you're all right.

455
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,715
I think I know
the answer.

456
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,717
Lyla, this isn't the right
time for this conversation.

457
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:42,920
When the Ghosts
attacked, you froze.

458
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:44,588
I've never seen you
do that before.

459
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,257
Lyla, I can't talk
about this.

460
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:47,458
Was it Andy?

461
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,326
- He was a Ghost.
- Lyla.

462
00:21:49,328 --> 00:21:50,594
If the world's
going to end,

463
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,063
then let's
at least go out

464
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:54,632
being honest
with each other.

465
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:57,434
Yes, it was Andy.

466
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:03,307
But not like I said

467
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:06,710
and not like you think.

468
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:12,016
Earlier you said
it was a good kill.

469
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,453
It wasn't, Lyla.

470
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,124
I said it was
self-defense.

471
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,626
It wasn't.

472
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,830
You must think
I'm a monster.

473
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:30,768
Fog of war, Johnny.

474
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:36,840
You did what
you had to do.

475
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:39,877
It's that simple.

476
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:43,747
Lyla, there's nothing
simple about this.

477
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:48,719
Darhk!

478
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,354
What does a guy
have to do

479
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:52,556
to end the world
in peace?

480
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:54,124
Why is he here, Daddy?

481
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:56,894
Oh, he came here
to die, sweetheart.

482
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:58,896
Clearly.

483
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,925
Ha ha ha!

484
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:16,125
15 minutes till
the end of the world,

485
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:18,192
and you want
to spend them with me.

486
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:20,861
I am touched.

487
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:29,837
Yeah, it looks like
the hacker's here.

488
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:44,719
Thanks, unless you
were aiming at me.

489
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:47,154
At this point,
I honestly can't tell.

490
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:51,726
Even if you stop me,
even if you could,

491
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:55,296
those missiles are
finding their targets.

492
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:01,569
This is a mercy killing
on a global scale.

493
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:03,804
I'm sparing my daughter
the pain of growing up

494
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:06,107
without her mother.

495
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:10,911
Or Mr. Lance living
without Laurel.

496
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:14,315
And don't get me
started on your pain.

497
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:15,983
Let him go!

498
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:20,488
Get out.

499
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,722
For real?

500
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:22,957
- Get out of here.
- Get out!

501
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,658
Get out
of our town!

502
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,260
We don't want you here!

503
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:28,596
Get out of this town!

504
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:31,432
"Get out." Heh heh heh.

505
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,940
This heartwarming display

506
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:41,242
would mean
a whole lot more

507
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:42,643
had I not just
seen you all

508
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:46,480
tearing yourselves
and your city apart.

509
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:47,848
Aah!

510
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:53,354
That is why I did this.

511
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:55,356
Humanity is feckless,

512
00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:56,624
and I wanted
to cleanse it

513
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,993
of a millennia
worth of rot

514
00:24:58,995 --> 00:25:00,995
it has been infected by,

515
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:02,530
and I will do it!

516
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:05,132
No, you won't.

517
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:09,970
Ok, just for fun,

518
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:12,506
how are you going
to stop me?

519
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:17,778
Because it won't just be me
who's going to stop you.

520
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:46,841
It's not so easy
without the magic, is it?

521
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:49,477
Oh, I don't need magic.

522
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:52,847
I'm a former member
of the League of Assassins,

523
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,015
or have you
forgotten that?

524
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,784
Remind me.

525
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:18,439
Oh, my God.

526
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:19,707
Cooper.

527
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,475
Hey, Felicity.

528
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:22,743
How you doing?

529
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:23,978
Who shot you?

530
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,246
Guess.

531
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,447
He's moving the bullet

532
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:28,415
closer and closer
to my spine.

533
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:29,617
I said it hurt so bad,

534
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,951
I'd do anything
to make him stop.

535
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:32,186
Like blow up the planet?

536
00:26:32,188 --> 00:26:34,722
Sorry, I'm
a selfish bastard,

537
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:36,357
but she knew that
already.

538
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,259
I need a moment
alone with him.

539
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:39,560
Felicity, I don't
think right--

540
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:41,428
Now.

541
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:44,465
I'm sorry, Felicity.

542
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:46,300
I know I should be
strong enough

543
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:49,603
to pull myself away
from this keyboard,

544
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:52,106
but I think we both
know that I'm not.

545
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:53,974
You are.

546
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:56,176
He's powerful.

547
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:58,245
He's so powerful,

548
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:01,081
and if I stop Rubicon,
he'll know,

549
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:04,952
and he'll kill me
in the most painful way possible.

550
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:07,688
You're better
than this, Cooper.

551
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,924
You're stronger than this.

552
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:12,660
You can still do
the right thing.

553
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:16,397
You can still be
the man that I loved.

554
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:19,333
I haven't been that guy
in a long time.

555
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:21,068
Remember what we wanted
to do 7 years ago

556
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,571
in that cockroach-infested
dorm room?

557
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:27,942
Save the world.

558
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:30,377
Now's your chance.

559
00:27:47,863 --> 00:27:53,534
Mr. Seldon,
you weak-willed dust mite.

560
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:04,011
I'm sorry, Cooper.

561
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:31,171
Oh.

562
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:32,539
You brought friends.

563
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,541
That's ok.

564
00:28:34,543 --> 00:28:37,344
So did I.

565
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:56,126
What the hell
happened?

566
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:57,460
Darhk.

567
00:28:57,462 --> 00:28:59,068
We have 3 minutes
to take down 15,000 nukes.

568
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:00,335
Why isn't this
a simple matter

569
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:01,392
of flicking off a switch?

570
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:03,323
Rubicon has safeguards
for their safeguards.

571
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,823
I can't disarm a warhead.

572
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,259
Then don't.

573
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:07,894
I don't think
you understand how this works.

574
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:09,162
It's not the warheads.
It's just the missile.

575
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,397
If we invert
their horizons...

576
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,032
They'll explode
in space.

577
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,251
Agh!

578
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,558
Now you know how it feels.

579
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,580
Wait. I thought you
and Donna--

580
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:40,847
Don't worry, she's safe,
but I had to come back

581
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:42,080
to stand with my city,

582
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:43,315
because this
Oliver Queen guy

583
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:44,583
gives a hell
of a speech.

584
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:45,851
You two were supposed
to stay as backup.

585
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,419
I already lost one brother.

586
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,687
You two put down
the Ghosts.

587
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:49,955
You keep people safe.

588
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,323
What about Darhk?

589
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:54,092
Darhk's mine.

590
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:33,085
What are you going
to do now, Oliver?

591
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,388
Stop the posturing.

592
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,124
We both know that
you can't do it.

593
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:39,859
You spared the life

594
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:44,664
of the man who
killed your mother.

595
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,166
And you killed
a friend of mine.

596
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:51,437
You killed tens of thousands
of innocent people.

597
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:56,242
With Slade Wilson,
I had a choice.

598
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:59,512
This time, I don't.

599
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:21,102
It's going to take
forever to clean this place up.

600
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,349
Well, I wish you guys
the best of luck with that.

601
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,050
You going home
to my mama?

602
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,186
Uh, yeah, to pack.

603
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:31,288
We're leaving town
for a while.

604
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,623
Wait, why?

605
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:35,059
IAB reached out.

606
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:38,328
My suspension is
no longer a suspension,

607
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,464
but, uh, it's funny,
you know,

608
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,033
because, you know,
being a cop's all I ever wanted,

609
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,069
but when I got that call,

610
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,771
I didn't feel a thing.

611
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,943
All I could think
about was Laurel, you know?

612
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,745
But then you got
her justice, Oliver,

613
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,048
and you got me
some closure,

614
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,617
and I am never going
to forget that.

615
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,055
Well, this is going
to make me feel

616
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,323
like I'm piling on...

617
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:07,591
What do you mean?

618
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,293
Well, I...

619
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,862
I jumped straight out
of the Lazarus Pit

620
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:17,367
right into this,
into--to Speedy,

621
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,103
but, um, I've just
been wondering

622
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,638
if this is even
who I really am,

623
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,974
and then I threatened
to kill a little girl,

624
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:27,711
and I--I realized I'm
my father's daughter,

625
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:31,115
so I--I thought
about Laurel

626
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:36,820
and--and what she'd say
to me if she were here.

627
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,324
I think she'd tell me
to get out...

628
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:43,627
Before I lost
too much of myself.

629
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,462
I'm sorry, Ollie.

630
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,664
Hey. Come here.

631
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:52,469
You don't have
to apologize to me, ever.

632
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:06,049
Well, it looks like
it's just the 3 of us.

633
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:11,455
Team Arrow,
the original gangstas.

634
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,459
Up top.

635
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,501
You ok?

636
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,937
Not really.

637
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,473
I told Lyla the truth
about Andy.

638
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,177
What'd she say?

639
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:37,581
She's a soldier.

640
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,684
She understood.

641
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,687
But I don't, and I don't
think I ever will.

642
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,789
What are you
going to do?

643
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:49,927
Take some time
away from this team,

644
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,697
away from the city...

645
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,432
To figure out where
I went off track

646
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:56,967
and how to get back on.

647
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:01,138
John, I have never
done this without you.

648
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,540
You're the one
who keeps me in line.

649
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,576
Oliver, I don't know
if you've been watching lately,

650
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:10,614
but it's been
the other way around, man.

651
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,967
She begged me to do it.

652
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,935
Agh!

653
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,170
Listen, I know that this

654
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,771
is not going to make
a ton of sense,

655
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:38,108
but all of this
has to do with that.

656
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,143
It is darkness.

657
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:43,046
Taiana...

658
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:47,551
She was coming
to that darkness.

659
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:51,955
They destroyed the plane.

660
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,758
That was Reiter.

661
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,062
But there's another way
off the island.

662
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,712
And here
I thought

663
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,581
you'd never use
the comm gear I gave you

664
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,383
to radio
for a trip home.

665
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:22,619
Well, I lost it
for a while,

666
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,088
and the job wasn't done.

667
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,590
And now it is.

668
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,425
I sent you here to break
up Reiter's operation

669
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,660
and free his prisoners.

670
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:30,894
You did both.

671
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,262
You saved
a lot of lives.

672
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,463
I took some, too.

673
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,965
Do you remember
what I told you?

674
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,567
That the only way
out is through?

675
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,336
Well, I am not out,
Amanda.

676
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,772
I'm still filled
with darkness.

677
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:44,441
This was never
about expunging your darkness,

678
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,109
Mr. Queen.

679
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,745
That darkness will
always be part of you.

680
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,682
Then what was the point?

681
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:53,450
To show you
that sometimes killing

682
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:57,421
is the only path
to justice.

683
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,695
Director Waller,

684
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:06,463
what do you want to do
with the artifact?

685
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,231
Have it transported
to the SLAB.

686
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,267
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,004
So that's it.

688
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,672
Just going to bag
and tag everything

689
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,108
and pretend like
nothing ever happened?

690
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,276
You've seen what
that idol can do,

691
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:23,146
how large
the world truly is.

692
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,552
Speaking of...

693
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,023
What am I going
to do with this?

694
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:37,327
Our business here
is concluded, Mr. Queen.

695
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:40,831
Unless it's not.

696
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:44,634
As I said, justice
requires killing.

697
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,336
A man of your talents
could be useful

698
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47,904
in hot spots
across the globe,

699
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:53,510
or you could just go back
to playing vigilante.

700
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:58,081
Neither.

701
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,717
I have a promise to keep.

702
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:05,055
I know you wouldn't
approve of what I did.

703
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,859
I mean, I know that
it's not what...

704
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:10,394
You would have wanted,

705
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,362
me killing Darhk,

706
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:13,563
but you were always

707
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,333
better than me, Laurel.

708
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:21,104
That is what I loved
most about you.

709
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:24,408
You ok?

710
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,210
No.

711
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,583
It's Thea and John.

712
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,420
Them leaving
has to be a blow.

713
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,888
And they're leaving

714
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,924
because of their own
personal darkness.

715
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,026
I just can't help
but think

716
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,128
that maybe they were
infected by mine.

717
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,730
Maybe.

718
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:49,566
Like you said, maybe you
can't become a hero

719
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,967
without succumbing
to the darkness

720
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,636
even a little bit,

721
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,204
but you were able
to defeat Darhk

722
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:57,374
by giving the city
its hope back.

723
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,644
You're saying it's
not black and white?

724
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm saying that
there is a man

725
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,583
who killed Darhk
in cold blood,

726
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,419
and that same man
stood on top of a car

727
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,322
and gave the city
its hope back.

728
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,790
What you're feeling
isn't darkness.

729
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,492
It's a schism.

730
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:18,829
You're at war with two
sides of yourself.

731
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:26,169
Hello.

732
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,804
Mr. Queen,
this is Thomas Kemp.

733
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,639
I chair
the city council.

734
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,874
Yes, of course, councilman.

735
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,108
What can I help you with?

736
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,477
That impromptu speech
you gave

737
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,078
during the city's
latest crisis

738
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,314
got a lot of people's
attention,

739
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,951
and there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

740
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:42,452
It's only an interim
appointment.

741
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,354
A proper election
will be held in August,

742
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:47,057
but given that you got
48% of the vote before

743
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,859
as a write-in candidate,

744
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:51,661
well, I think that's
just a formality.

745
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,264
I appreciate the optimism.

746
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,199
Are you sure
about this?

747
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,002
You look,
well, conflicted.

748
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,670
Well, someone
very close to me

749
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:05,242
recently told me
that I am...

750
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:07,310
But I am ready for this.

751
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:08,545
Good.

752
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,814
Shall we?

753
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:26,897
Put your left hand
on the Bible.

754
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:30,333
Raise your right hand
and recite the oath.

755
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,502
I, Oliver Queen,

756
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,704
do solemnly swear
to support the charter

757
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,406
and laws of Star City

758
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,441
and to faithfully
and impartially

759
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:39,743
perform and discharge

760
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,711
the duties
of the office of mayor

761
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,913
according to the law

762
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:45,615
and to the very best
of my ability.

763
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,551
Congratulations.

764
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,622
I didn't know
you'd be here.

765
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:35,859
You thought
I was leaving, too?

766
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,462
Not a chance.

768
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:00,758
Greg!
Move your head.
