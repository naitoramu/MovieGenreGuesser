1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,440
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,989
Galaxy One has us
outmanned and outgunned.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,216
You want to even the odds,
you get out there

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,356
and you fight
the hell back.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,160
Hyah! Hyah!

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,556
Dinah sent you.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,199
Give this to Felicity.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,776
You military types
are like Swiss watches.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,713
Youse are always
on time. Show me.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,674
Show me what you got.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,960
Where's Emiko?

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,456
Well, if I told you that,
Mr. Queen,

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,153
she'd have me head.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,233
And, frankly, that's a part
of me I'd like to keep.

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,557
That Virgil is
damn slippery.

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,996
At least now we know what
he's trying to acquire.

17
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,952
A.R.G.U.S. vault drive,

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,430
triple-level encryption
for eyes-only documents.

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,034
If someone at
the agency's leaking

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,376
classified intel to
The Ninth Circle...

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,776
right. But if we have
some indication

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,951
as to what they're
planning finally,

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,350
it might help me
find Emiko.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,558
And you said
you didn't need any backup.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,869
Yeah. Well, we
lost Virgil,

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,394
but we got what
he was after.

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,600
This drive feels like our
best lead at finding Emiko,

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,920
at least
until Archer's back up.

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,553
Alena is pulling
all-nighters

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,696
to get Archer
back up and running,

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,599
and once it is, we will
be able to find Emiko.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,640
And finally tell her that
Dante killed her mother.

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,558
And, hopefully,
she'll come to her senses

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,915
about The Ninth Circle.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,416
Well, that
would be enough for me

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,656
to turn myself against
the evil organization

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
that raised me as a child.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,352
- Crap!
- What's that? What's wrong?

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,696
The drive has
a security failsafe

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,056
that fried all the files,
probably to prevent

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,480
someone like me
from trying to do

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,153
what I am trying to do.

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,960
But these aren't
A.R.G.U.S.-encrypted protocols.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,176
Someone else must've written the
security program for this drive.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,839
Wait. If it's not
A.R.G.U.S., who is it?

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,936
Well, I have hacked enough
government servers in my day

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,336
to know that this is the
department of defense.

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,376
Not that I do that anymore,
because I work with the SCPD.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
But this branch is
the D.I.A.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,976
What would
The Ninth Circle want

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
with the defense
intelligence agency?

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
We need to find out.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,096
You're married to
the A.R.G.U.S. director.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,156
Maybe she can help.

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,376
Yeah, well, any inquiries to
A.R.G.U.S. will send up red flags,

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,234
paint an even bigger target on
Lyla's back than there already is.

57
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,279
I think I might have an
old contact at the D.I.A.

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,190
A General.

59
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,476
The General will be
right with you, gentlemen.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,951
Hey. What's...
what's going on?

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,096
You're acting like we're
being sent

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
to the principal's office.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,680
This guy can be
a real hard-ass.

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
Just let me do the talking.

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,238
OK. How do you know him?

66
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,996
Ah. I must say,
I was surprised to hear from you, John.

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,639
Well, sir, I wouldn't
have made the call

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,155
unless it was very,
very important.

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,631
No, I imagine you
wouldn't have.

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,679
You must be
Oliver Queen...

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,797
the legendary
Green Arrow.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,473
I'm General Stewart.

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,616
A pleasure to meet you,
General Stewart.

74
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,736
Thank you for taking
the time.

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm not gonna lie, son.
I wasn't always a fan.

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,914
But since you
got out of prison,

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,595
you seem like a changed man,
and I respect that.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,796
Thank you, sir.

79
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,056
Sir, we made the call
because we were hoping

80
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,296
you could tell us what
was on this.

81
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
Ah. Where'd
you get it?

82
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,520
We intercepted a handoff
between an A.R.G.U.S. agent

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,480
and a man that works for a
group called The Ninth Circle.

84
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,040
The terrorist
financiers.

85
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,395
I heard they
were just a rumor.

86
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,676
No, sir,
they are very real.

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,736
And we have reason to suspect
they are planning something.

88
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,797
We were hoping you had
intel that you could give us

89
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,155
and the SCPD.

90
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,596
I'm afraid I can't.

91
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,275
But even if I did,
John, you know

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,471
I can't just hand over
classified intel,

93
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,153
not without
proper clearance,

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,590
which you no longer have
since you left A.R.G.U.S.

95
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,176
Of course. But, sir, we
were still hoping that maybe

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
you could, uh...

97
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,751
you were on a path
destined for the Pentagon,

98
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,150
maybe even a post with
the joint chiefs.

99
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,674
Now where are you?

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,672
Working with the cops,
playing vigilante?

101
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,877
That's no career.
That's a dead end.

102
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,189
No offense.

103
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,636
<i>I wasn't even sure you
were keeping tabs on me.</i>

104
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,189
Sir, I had my reasons
for leaving A.R.G.U.S.

105
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,680
You left to protect
your wife.

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,275
I know you better
than you think.

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,319
And I'm sorry to say
you lost your way.

108
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,837
I didn't leave
A.R.G.U.S. for my career.

109
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,877
I left to protect
my family.

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,416
And that's not something
you would understand,

111
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,113
is it, sir?

112
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,590
John,
we should probably go.

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,713
Again, thank you
for your time, General.

114
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,315
I always have time
for my family.

115
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,914
Excuse me?

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,754
Oh, John didn't
tell you.

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,314
I'm his stepfather.

118
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,277
Frak! Ugh!

119
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,840
Well, I guess I don't have
to ask how this is going.

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,634
Well, as glad as I am that
you both got to meet Laurel,

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
her cry really did
a number on this helmet.

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,159
How did it go
at the bunker?

123
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,835
Good. The bombs we stole from
Galaxy One are now secure.

124
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,718
Roy and Dinah are
setting up a perimeter

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,336
in case they ever come
looking for them.

126
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,056
And William is making sure
they can't be detonated

127
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,151
unless,
well, we say so.

128
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,436
Although maybe
he'd be more useful

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,670
helping you out with this?

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,796
The helmet is inlaid

131
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,376
with this highly
advanced circuitry mesh

132
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,517
and retinal display,
and I will not be able

133
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,216
to figure out why until I
get it up and running.

134
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,376
What do you think
you'll find?

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,280
Hopefully, whatever
Galaxy One has planned next,

136
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,676
if they haven't stopped from
making the city go boom-boom.

137
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,672
Well,
can't we just ask our man on the inside?

138
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,976
No. We can't come in
contact with Rene

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,480
until we get
the go-ahead from Zoe.

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,800
They're at Glades
city hall now,

141
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,360
and we don't want to
blow their cover.

142
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,991
OK, so how do we get this
piece of junk up and running?

143
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,753
The power module
is comprised

144
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,797
with an alloy
proprietary to Galaxy One.

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,473
I've been trying
to work around it,

146
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,313
but I can't without
the real thing.

147
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,496
Wait. I thought
this helmet was

148
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,874
a one-of-a-kind
prototype.

149
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,656
As far as we know. But
the power module is not,

150
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,319
which means we
need to find one.

151
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,312
All right, public enemy
number one, sit tight.

152
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,039
I know where to go.
Be back in an hour.

153
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
Anyone dealing in
secret weapons tech

154
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,960
won't be friendly.

155
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,076
You need backup.

156
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,197
Better safe than sorry.

157
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,439
Keep up.

158
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,109
<i>Felicity Smoak now
entering Smoak Tech.</i>

159
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,318
I have missed
your sweet Voice.

160
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,198
You know she's not
a real person, right?

161
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,317
Of course
she's not.

162
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
No. I am just so glad
that we were able

163
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,679
to start building the
program out again.

164
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,877
It feels wrong confining
Archer to just one tablet,

165
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
even temporarily.

166
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,520
She deserves to
spread her wings

167
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,035
right after we find
Oliver's evil half-sister.

168
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,152
Speaking of
spreading wings, um,

169
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,596
I think I've found a way to
help Smoak Tech really soar.

170
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,875
Oh, yeah?

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,376
Yeah. There's someone interested
in buying the company.

172
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,536
It's just you, me,
and Archer.

173
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,976
I mean, who would be
interested in that?

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,434
Dr. Will Magnus.

175
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,720
What? Huh.
The Dr. Will Magnus?

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,836
Mm-hmm.

177
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,976
The world's foremost
authority

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,957
- on robotics engineering.
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,160
When I was ceo of
Palmer Tech,

180
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,416
he wouldn't even
return my calls.

181
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,636
My friend at Magnus Labs
says that Archer

182
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
could really help Doc Magnus with
these new a.I.S he's building.

183
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,990
I could set a meeting.

184
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,673
Magnus Labs is
the gold standard

185
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,558
in A.I.S.

186
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,456
Oh, my god. With their backing,
we could expand Archer to be

187
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,856
more than just
a genetic tracking system

188
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,976
or surveillance
for the SCPD.

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,674
I mean, it could be a bigger and
better overwatch system. I mean...

190
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,114
it's a chance
to change the world.

191
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,270
Uh-huh.

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,636
<i>Warning.
Intruder alert.</i>

193
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,791
<i>Warning. Intruder alert.</i>

194
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,399
Tick-tock, lads.
In and out.

195
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,120
Look for the device
drawing the most power.

196
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,038
Ohh. Ohh.

197
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,590
Hidden on a tablet.
Ha! Crafty.

198
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,710
Put the tablet down,
call your men off,

199
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,154
and I'll let
you live.

200
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,192
Felicity!

201
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,476
Sorry, love. No can do.

202
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,910
Pistol beats keyboard,
darling.

203
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,955
Who the hell
are these guys?

204
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,233
You're safe now.

205
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,119
They weren't after me.

206
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
<i>Oh, my god. She's gone.</i>

207
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,876
They couldn't have
gotten her, could they?

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,151
The Ninth Circle has Archer.

209
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,896
Then this crazy Irish guy
came busting through,

210
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,336
and Alena and I
tried to fight them off,

211
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
but then the D.I.A. came crashing through
the ceiling and took them all out.

212
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,256
- What about Archer?
- Virgil made away with it.

213
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,999
We'll get it back.
I'm glad you're OK.

214
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,336
How did they find out
about Archer?

215
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,920
I'll give you
one guess... Emiko.

216
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,437
I'm sorry my men weren't
there sooner, Ms. Smoak.

217
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,240
It seems The Ninth Circle was
a step ahead of us as well.

218
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,312
You must be General Stewart,

219
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,757
a.k.a. The stepfather that John hasn't
told his closest friends about.

220
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,753
So this is
where you people work.

221
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,876
Impressive.

222
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,194
How did your men end up
at Smoak Tech, General?

223
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,800
Several months ago,
the D.I.A. Got wind

224
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,872
of a Ninth Circle mole
inside A.R.G.U.S.

225
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,240
Since then, we've
made it a point

226
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,192
of tracking their
activity, including

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,033
the theft of that drive,
which led us

228
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,395
to your friend Virgil.

229
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,110
Wait. Wait. Wait.
I thought you said you didn't know anything.

230
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,192
I said I couldn't tell
you anything.

231
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,638
A lie of omission is still a lie,
General.

232
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,318
I'm sorry, John,
but it was classified.

233
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,073
What was on the drive?

234
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,311
A list of assets we have
in the field...

235
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,036
special operatives with
high-level security clearance.

236
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,799
<i>That's why
Emiko took Archer,</i>

237
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,234
so that she could
hunt them down

238
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,816
and then gain access
to what they know,

239
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,433
which she could
pretty much do

240
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,637
with anybody now that
she has their DNA.

241
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,016
It's only a matter of time before
they find everyone on that list.

242
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,918
We need to make sure
those assets are secure.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,195
We have protocols in place.

244
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,112
I'll call my assets to
a safe house.

245
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,440
This is General Stewart.
We need to start evacuations.

246
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,239
Uh...

247
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,714
Oliver, before
you get started,

248
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,120
I'm fine, man.

249
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,416
The second time that you've
broken the chain of command

250
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,635
with a 4-star General.

251
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,760
That's not like you, John.

252
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,718
You expect me to say
"yes, sir" to that man?

253
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,272
I... you know, i... I'd like
to know why you won't.

254
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,874
And...

255
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,920
I would like to know
why you never...

256
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,437
never mentioned that
you had a stepfather.

257
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,840
I didn't see much
of a need to.

258
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,714
That man has not
been in my life

259
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,797
since I left home
and joined the military.

260
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,314
OK. I just met him.

261
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,993
All I have is my
first impression,

262
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,280
and my first
impression is that

263
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,913
he doesn't seem like
that bad of a guy.

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,311
Oliver, when I first met
the General,

265
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,157
he was a lieutenant,

266
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,711
my father's co on
a covert military op

267
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,759
to quell an insurgency
in vlatava.

268
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,559
The op went bad.

269
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,313
<i>The unit was pinned down</i>

270
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,073
<i>with heavy gunfire from
insurgents.</i>

271
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,518
My dad stayed behind
to hold them off.

272
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,672
Saved the whole unit.
Stewart made it out.

273
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,240
My father didn't.

274
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,313
So do you blame him
for your father's death?

275
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,836
It was his op.
He should've stayed behind.

276
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,240
<i>Six months later,</i>

277
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,553
he's coming by
the house for dinner.

278
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,835
Six months, Oliver.

279
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,990
I didn't know.

280
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,275
It was bad enough that, uh,

281
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,556
he just appeared
in our lives, but...

282
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,629
Once he and my mom
got married,

283
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,871
he had me and Andy running

284
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,078
Spartan survival drills he
learned as a recon marine.

285
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,856
<i>I mean, how long could we
be out in the cold</i>

286
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,349
<i>trying to find our way out of
the woods without a compass.</i>

287
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,352
He called it "tough love."

288
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Said he didn't care how we
felt about him

289
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,874
as long
as it made us strong.

290
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,872
I don't know.
If he was so strong,

291
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,476
how could he just abandon
the first rule of the corps

292
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,675
and leave my father behind?

293
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,355
- Thanks. Owe you one.
- You got it.

294
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,236
You get a lead?

295
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,676
Finally, someone not
afraid to talk.

296
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,116
There's a guy here
trading galaxy merch.

297
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
The only problem is

298
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,478
he's in Deathstroke territory.

299
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,519
Well, that won't be
a problem. Trust me.

300
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,239
Trust you?

301
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Funny.

302
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,056
OK. Are you ever gonna
let me off the hook?

303
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,992
Doubtful.

304
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,675
Great. Well, you should
let me handle this.

305
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,320
You're backup,
remember?

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,473
So back me up.

307
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,953
Hey. There's a vendor back
there we need to talk to.

308
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,430
And I'm just gonna let
you in because why?

309
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,273
'Cause I'll kick your
ass if you don't.

310
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,518
OK. That won't be necessary.

311
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,159
I got the mark.

312
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,357
- From who?
- Your boss.

313
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,080
Check it.

314
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,560
How you know jj?

315
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,916
You just need
to know that I do.

316
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,070
We good?

317
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,589
Hey.

318
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,114
Who the hell is jj?

319
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,590
He's my brother...
John Jr.

320
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,117
John Diggle has
one son in knightwatch

321
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,999
and another who's the leader
of the Deathstroke gang.

322
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,720
That must make family
dinners interesting.

323
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,314
Well, he grew up
hating my parents,

324
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,278
and the expectations
they put on us.

325
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,776
That's why I'm glad that
you finally figured out

326
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
the truth about
your family.

327
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,636
Look, I've wanted to
tell you the truth

328
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,120
for a long time.

329
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,510
What else don't
I know about you?

330
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,592
How long you got?

331
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,336
I don't think that gun's gonna
get any cleaner than that.

332
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
I just want to be
prepared.

333
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,639
I can't slip up with
The Ninth Circle.

334
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,599
- And Emiko?
- What about her?

335
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,920
Well, I know you two
were close,

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,216
and you haven't said a thing about
her since she went all evil.

337
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,835
I'm not so sure
she's all evil.

338
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,198
When we were at
the airfield,

339
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,192
there was a moment
when Emiko and I

340
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,590
were alone, and...

341
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,509
She had
the upper hand.

342
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,196
I thought I was dead.

343
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,600
I mean, I should
have been dead,

344
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,315
but she let me go.

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,275
And that tells you what?

346
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,920
I don't know, but it
can't be as simple

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,195
as her being
all bad.

348
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,794
I mean, we've all
gone through paths

349
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,030
where we've come
to regret.

350
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,032
Hell, if Laurel can
redeem herself,

351
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,077
then maybe Emiko
can do the same.

352
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,436
We got
a problem, people.

353
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,670
What's going on?

354
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,558
I just got off the phone
with intelligence.

355
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,360
All of our assets have been accounted for,
except one...

356
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,750
an undercover agent by
the name of Julian Sison.

357
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
He should be
at a safe house,

358
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,999
but there's been no response
since the call came in.

359
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,356
- Where is the safe house?
- 30 miles norTheast of here.

360
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,669
<i>We'll get into it.</i>

361
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,256
I'll check with the other assets,
see if there's been any...

362
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,555
I'll come with you.

363
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,719
Somebody needs to keep
an eye on you.

364
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,352
You think I'm trying
to mislead you?

365
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,920
"Fool me once," right?

366
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,232
That's not
very fair, John.

367
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,233
It's OK. You can come.

368
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,720
Follow my lead.

369
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,717
<i>This place is
a pigsty.</i>

370
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,280
Either he's messy as hell...

371
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,158
or someone made it that way.

372
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,436
Overwatch, any sign
of our guests?

373
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,150
I'm getting
3 heat sigs further in.

374
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,275
What the hell's going on?

375
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,238
- Are you Julian Sison?
- Yeah.

376
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,391
Then why didn't you
answer your transponder?

377
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,274
'Cause I'm in
the middle of an op,

378
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,431
and you three just blew it.

379
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,913
Overwatch, there is
no sign of Emiko

380
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,559
or The Ninth Circle.

381
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,871
If this guy isn't
the target, then who is?

382
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,471
Those are my assets.

383
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,714
Overwatch,
we have men down.

384
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,393
The Ninth Circle knew
we were coming.

385
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,271
General, we've been
looking for you.

386
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,976
I'm trying to track John's Spartan helmet,
but it's offline.

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,435
Clearly this was an elaborate
play to draw General Stewart.

388
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,830
We need to find he
and John, and quickly.

389
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,616
I'll put a bolo
out for both of them.

390
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,936
I'll put the word
out around The Glades

391
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,679
in case Emiko shows up
in the old 'hood.

392
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,831
Or we just find
Emiko and end all this.

393
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,191
We will.
We have found people without Archer before.

394
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,760
We will find John
and his stepdad,

395
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,360
and then we will
find your sister.

396
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,194
Kidnapping a 4-star General
is a risky move

397
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,430
for The Ninth Circle,

398
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,477
especially if
the Pentagon's on to them.

399
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,994
So why? Why do it?

400
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,896
I don't know.
We need to find out more about who he is,

401
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,000
what makes him
so important.

402
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,839
I'd imagine his files are
really, really classified.

403
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,040
"Really, really classified" sounds really,
really fun.

404
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,515
I'm on it.

405
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,475
General?

406
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,359
John, are you
all right?

407
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,715
Yeah. You?

408
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,156
I've taken worse hits
than this.

409
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,720
<i>Where do you
think we are?</i>

410
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,996
I don't know.

411
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,076
Maybe a Ninth Circle
safe house. I don't know.

412
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,436
They must've found out I
was looking into them.

413
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,792
Agh! We got to get
the hell out of here.

414
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,394
You're not going to will those
things into breaking, John.

415
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,392
Do you not remember
anything I taught you?

416
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,795
How could I forget?

417
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,392
I know I was hard
on you, son,

418
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,711
but I wanted you
to be prepared.

419
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
It paid off.

420
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,950
Look at you now.

421
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,752
Really? We're captured,
probably gonna die in here.

422
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,190
We're not dead yet.

423
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,472
<i>What about your helmet?</i>

424
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,519
Yeah. Yeah, that could work.

425
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,256
If we could get to it,
I could send a signal to the others,

426
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,873
tell us our location.

427
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,511
Time for us to have
a little chat, General.

428
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,993
- Hey.
- Yeah.

429
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,512
- Oh, good work.
- Thanks.

430
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,829
All right. Anything
in the file

431
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,115
that will help us
find them?

432
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,716
No. But, uh, plenty on why The
Ninth Circle would want him.

433
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,916
OK.

434
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,080
Thrice-decorated commander
of the 1st recon battalion

435
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,191
during the khandaq
conflict, after which

436
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,351
he was appointed commandant
of the Marine Corps,

437
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,836
then chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff.

438
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,576
I mean,
the guy is a real bona fide American hero.

439
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,150
Not to John. John blames
General Stewart

440
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,790
for his father's death
during a mission

441
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,678
they were both on
in vlatava.

442
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,592
Oh, yeah. That would be
enough to alienate

443
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,275
someone like John,
and why he wouldn't have told us about him,

444
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,591
but it's not true.

445
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,716
Which part?

446
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,096
According to the Pentagon's
official account,

447
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,736
the vlatava mission was
so successful that

448
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,536
the General was actually,
for a stint of time,

449
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,994
appointed Head of DARPA.

450
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,596
But if... If the mission
was a success,

451
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,797
why would he lie
to John about it?

452
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,234
To protect him?

453
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,399
It's been a long time since we've
seen each other, agent Diggle.

454
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Go to hell.

455
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,795
Hold that thought.

456
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,951
I want the codes to
project Cygnus X-1.

457
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,509
My name is
General Roy Stewart.

458
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,832
Serial number
498003145,

459
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,400
United States
Marine Corps.

460
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,269
Yes, yes. The military's
trained you well,

461
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,034
but you'll break eventually.

462
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,356
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!

463
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,716
Now let's try it again,
General.

464
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,837
The codes,
project Cygnus X-1.

465
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,594
My name is
General Roy Stewart.

466
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,798
Serial number
498003145...

467
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,076
enough! I guess we're
gonna have to do this

468
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,389
the hard way.

469
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,158
<i>Leave him alone.</i>

470
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,674
This has nothing
to do with him.

471
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,399
Give me the codes or...

472
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,233
Don't tell him anything.

473
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,160
Stop. Stop it!
I'll tell you. Stop.

474
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,675
5693016.

475
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,195
Now, was that so hard?

476
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,313
You all right,
John?

477
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,278
Why did you give him
the code?

478
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,074
A thank you would
be good enough.

479
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,152
What the hell is
Cygnus X-1 anyway?

480
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,550
Something we don't want The
Ninth Circle to know about.

481
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,120
Now, let's get
out of here.

482
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,833
<i>There's a box cutter
on the table.</i>

483
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,718
I got something better.

484
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,680
What the hell are
you doing?

485
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,116
You really don't remember
anything I taught you, do you?

486
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,511
With enough pressure
applied at a steady pace,

487
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,435
a shoelace can saw
through plastic.

488
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,480
Damn. There's no power.

489
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,838
How about we give it
a boost?

490
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,837
John's helmet just
came back online.

491
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,355
Morse code... sos.
Location?

492
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,736
Warehouse in
the meatpacking district.

493
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,035
Call the team.

494
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,996
Clear.

495
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,176
You know, you could be
court-martialed

496
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,793
for giving up that info
to Dante.

497
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,678
It was a necessary
risk.

498
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,558
You don't leave
a man behind.

499
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,715
Sooner or later, they're gonna
send someone looking for us.

500
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,078
Let's get you the hell
out of here.

501
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,236
That's got to sting.

502
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,471
Yeah, I've been
through worse.

503
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,616
What'd The Ninth Circle
want from you, General?

504
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,075
Access to an experimental
weapon I oversaw

505
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,594
during my tenure at DARPA...

506
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,751
Cygnus X-1.

507
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,230
The project was shelved
because it was too dangerous

508
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,198
and unstable.

509
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,875
The goal was to genetically
engineer bacteria

510
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,435
to consume the by-product
of nuclear fission.

511
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,576
<i>So it's
a biological weapon</i>

512
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,016
that can literally
eat through anything.

513
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,918
- That's terrifying.
- Yeah.

514
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,776
A weapon like that falls in the
hands of the Ninth Circle, we're...

515
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,190
it won't.
We're gonna stop them.

516
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,715
The problem is
I don't know where it is.

517
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,190
- Archer.
- Great.

518
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,873
They are going to use

519
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,314
the intel they get
from the assets

520
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,110
to locate the DNA of the
people involved in Cygnus X-1.

521
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,520
That DNA
can lead them

522
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,398
to exactly where
that weapon is.

523
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,736
If I can piggyback
off Archer's signal,

524
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,797
I'll be able to...

525
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,553
Lead us right
to them.

526
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,757
It's like we're tracking
the DNA of a DNA tracker.

527
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
This is so meta.

528
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,776
We need to be ready the moment
they reactivate Archer.

529
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,336
It's the only way
to locate her signature.

530
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,680
Yeah, like one of
those FBI movies

531
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,936
where you have to keep
the kidnapper on the line

532
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,030
to trace the call.

533
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,736
Yeah, except the kidnapper
is the tech I invented,

534
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,274
which almost makes me
wish I hadn't.

535
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,536
What happened to Archer
putting Smoak Tech on the map?

536
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,800
Well, that was before I
realized

537
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,976
all the bad that
she could do.

538
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,056
I wanted to invent something
that would help save the city,

539
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
and instead I made something
that can destroy it.

540
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,157
Oh, my god.
I'm a mad scientist.

541
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, my god, no. It's
so much worse than that.

542
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,918
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
I'm my dad.

543
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,960
I am your friend who has
some real-life experience

544
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,440
working with evil geniuses,

545
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,591
and you need to trust me
on this one.

546
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,478
You are not one of them, OK?

547
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,119
OK.

548
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
You gonna tell me
what's really bothering you?

549
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,114
I love Team Arrow,
but it is not enough.

550
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,839
I need to do
something separate.

551
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,120
I need to do
something separate

552
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,236
that can still do good,

553
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,656
and that's what Archer
was supposed to be.

554
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,336
You know,
my way of making my mark on the world,

555
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,000
and not as overwatch.

556
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,230
As me.

557
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,436
Well...

558
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,154
It can still be that.

559
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,754
We just need to get
Archer back,

560
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,593
and when we do, you just
need to figure out

561
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,639
how to make sure that
your beautiful creation

562
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,439
is used exactly the way
you intended.

563
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,798
You got this, Smoak.

564
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,000
Normally I'm the one
off by myself

565
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,360
staring into nothing.

566
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,473
That's usually true.

567
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,916
Usually I'm the one
with the father-son issues.

568
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,913
Oliver, people's lives
are in danger

569
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,957
because my stepfather
couldn't be honest with me.

570
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,670
It j... It just surprises me
that you don't see his position.

571
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,031
You know, he's at the top
of the chain of command.

572
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,635
The John Diggle that I know,

573
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,518
he would have done
the exact same thing.

574
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,096
Oliver, you sound like
you're on his side, man.

575
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,353
I'm on your side, but I'm
looking at a guy over there

576
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,518
who cares for you, who
was trying to protect you.

577
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,434
Frankly,
he deserves a little bit more of your trust.

578
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,760
What is this?

579
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,433
Those are
the unredacted files

580
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,831
from the vlatava mission.

581
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,479
Your father didn't die
saving his unit.

582
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,798
According to that, he died
because he was negligent.

583
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,036
<i>And he took two marines
with him.</i>

584
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,919
The only reason that anyone
got out of there was

585
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
General Stewart.

586
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,072
That's not possible.

587
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,719
<i>It's all in there.</i>

588
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,110
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this, John.

589
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,711
One Galaxy One
power module.

590
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,016
I guess there are
perks to having

591
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,474
a gang leader
black sheep brother.

592
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,234
Hmm. Sounds like my
kind of people.

593
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,674
When do I get to meet him?

594
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,390
I don't know. I haven't
seen jj in a year,

595
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,110
maybe more.

596
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,597
Funny thing is he used
to be my best friend.

597
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,275
What happened?

598
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,513
Ah, he and my dad
started butting heads.

599
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,159
Guess I got caught up
in the middle.

600
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,833
And this
Deathstroke thing,

601
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,389
that was just a way
to rebel.

602
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,797
I just thought one day,
he'd outgrow it.

603
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,000
But I tried to
reach him.

604
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,916
In the end, I think
I just reminded him

605
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,992
of everything my mom and
dad expected him to be.

606
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,034
I'm sorry.

607
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,674
Ain't your fault.

608
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,592
No. I just...

609
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,151
got so mad at you
for lying to me that I...

610
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
I never thought about

611
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,676
how much it must've
sucked for you,

612
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,314
and not having anybody
to share things with.

613
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,074
You know, this life.

614
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,552
It was unfair to
both of us.

615
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,314
Hey.

616
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,914
Jj has a message
for you.

617
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,714
Hey!

618
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,753
This way. Come on!

619
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,239
Get back!

620
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,998
It's time to go.

621
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,153
Hey, guys, we found
the weapon.

622
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,320
Well, technically,
The Ninth Circle did using Archer.

623
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,616
Felicity and I rode
their coattails

624
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,696
right into the secure facility,
where it's being stored.

625
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,677
Yup, that's definitely
a secret weapons depot.

626
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,816
OK, well, now that
we know where we're going,

627
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,776
we just have to figure out
how to get past Archer.

628
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,154
The moment you
set foot onsite,

629
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,456
The Ninth Circle will
know that you're there.

630
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,840
So we lose the element
of surprise.

631
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
I'll call my team.

632
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,394
No. Wait.

633
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,349
We got this.

634
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,476
Copy that.

635
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,390
Let's move.

636
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,556
Perfect.

637
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,711
<i>Perimeter breach
detected.</i>

638
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,838
<i>Scanning intruders' DNA.
Identifying.</i>

639
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,832
It's your brother
and his friends.

640
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,070
Stop them.

641
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,118
Overwatch, do you have
a bead on Emiko?

642
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,496
I'm hacked into the
exterior cameras,

643
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,696
but she must
already be inside.

644
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,030
Without Archer,
it's like I'm flying in blind.

645
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,696
Isn't that what these boosters are for?

646
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,576
Yes.
Once you've planted the signal boosters,

647
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,136
I will be able to take
back control of Archer

648
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
and find Emiko.

649
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Go find your sister.

650
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,595
We'll plant
the boosters.

651
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,799
Oliver,
you have company.

652
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,152
Archer has
our positions locked.

653
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,440
Where are we with
the boosters?

654
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,557
Boosters are in place
and activated.

655
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,994
Good to go, overwatch.

656
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,998
We have uplink.

657
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,720
It's not working.

658
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,800
I can't get through
their firewall.

659
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,016
Wait. They locked you out
of your own program? How?

660
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,496
I don't know, but whatever they did,
I can't get back control of Archer.

661
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,636
Get down!

662
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,990
We need an exfil
route now! Now!

663
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,472
Most black-level facilities
follow the same blueprint.

664
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,517
There should be a door
near your position

665
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,000
that leads
to an access tunnel.

666
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,240
Are you sure?!

667
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,754
Trust me.

668
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,957
Let's move!
Move!

669
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,671
We're clear, General. Thanks.

670
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,275
Emiko is headed to the parking
garage with the weapon.

671
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,776
What the hell are you doing?

672
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,110
I'm infecting it with a
self-destruct protocol.

673
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,616
Those boosters were
the only reason we

674
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,680
were able to access
Archer.

675
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,096
If The Ninth Circle gets
their hands on it,

676
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,776
we may never be able
to access Archer again.

677
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,190
Well, what about all your
hard work, your legacy?

678
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,158
I guess I'll just have
to build a new one.

679
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,037
Archer's gone down.

680
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,952
It doesn't matter.
We got what we came for.

681
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,800
Take the weapon and go.

682
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,560
Me and my brother have
unfinished business.

683
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,034
Emiko!

684
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,032
You need to listen to me.

685
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,038
You need to hear this.

686
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,440
Dante's been
lying to you.

687
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,389
He killed your mother.

688
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,520
Liar.

689
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,193
Hyah!

690
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,080
Listen to me.

691
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,550
He set all this in motion.

692
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,031
He used The Ninth Circle's
resources to cover it up.

693
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,796
He misled you.
He doesn't care about you.

694
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,629
I do.

695
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,671
Emiko.

696
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,240
I told you to go.

697
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,152
And I told you I
won't leave you.

698
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,752
We're currently in a tie
between good news and bad news,

699
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,991
the good news being
that I destroyed Archer,

700
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,231
which I can't believe I'm
counting as good news.

701
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,152
The bad news is
The Ninth Circle

702
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,136
got away with a very
dangerous biological weapon.

703
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,516
How did things
go with Emiko?

704
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,353
I told her that Dante
killed her mother,

705
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,794
and it didn't make
any difference.

706
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,918
I guess bad news
wins this round.

707
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,753
We need to plan
our next move.

708
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
What is our next move?

709
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,274
Start by figuring out

710
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,319
what The Ninth Circle intends
to do with Cygnus X-1.

711
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,632
I should take this
to the D.I.A. Brass.

712
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,790
Thank you.

713
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,673
I'll walk you out.

714
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,670
Hey.

715
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,472
I know how much you wanted
Oliver's plan to work.

716
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,816
Maybe I should be grateful
that I can finally

717
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,360
get to see Emiko
for who she really is.

718
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
Maybe.

719
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,278
It doesn't make it
hurt any less.

720
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,996
<i>Hey, I, um...</i>

721
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,072
Wanted to say thank you.

722
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,598
I know this...

723
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,399
I know I haven't made
it easy for you.

724
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,976
This is the most time
we've spent together

725
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,434
since you turned 18.

726
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,319
As hard as it may be
to believe,

727
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,517
I'm grateful for it.

728
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,159
Yeah, I'd prefer
a round of golf

729
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,359
to kidnapping and...
And torture.

730
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,959
I know you might not
feel the same way,

731
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,114
but you will always
be a son to me.

732
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,438
Oliver told me the truth
about vlatava,

733
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,869
about my father.

734
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,997
Why did you let me
believe a lie?

735
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,877
You let me hate you.

736
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,514
Every child
deserves to believe

737
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,592
that his father
is a hero.

738
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,434
And believing it,
you became one.

739
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,036
If he could see you today,

740
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,277
I know he would be
so proud of you.

741
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,994
If I'm a hero...

742
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,114
It was all because
of you...

743
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,913
Sir.

744
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,793
- John.
- Yes, sir.

745
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,394
Call your mother.

746
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,856
I figured out
the silver lining

747
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,918
to the whole torpedoing
our only viable product is

748
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,656
that we are gonna save
so much money on servers

749
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,672
because Archer was
a power suck.

750
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,710
Not even a chuckle.

751
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,856
I guess I'm not
really in the mood

752
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,109
for the whole
dark humor thing,

753
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,481
what with our only viable
product being destroyed and all.

754
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,871
I'm sorry I destroyed
our golden goose.

755
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,156
Golden egg. Goose?

756
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,833
You know, we could rebuild.

757
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,039
Make it better,
less stealable.

758
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,315
Heh.

759
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,193
When you were uploading
the self-destruct code,

760
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,432
I copied Archer's root code.

761
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,753
But with that and your notes,
we could start over.

762
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,436
No. I appreciate that.

763
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,696
But as long as Archer's
out there,

764
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,315
it could fall into
the wrong hands. And...

765
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,856
I don't know what my
legacy's going to be,

766
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,917
but it can't be that.

767
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,195
Well, that sounds
like someone

768
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,640
who hasn't heard
Doc Magnus' offer.

769
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,079
Relax. I know.

770
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,950
Legacy trumps payday.

771
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,816
Well, I'm really glad you're
the cto and not the cfo,

772
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,056
because the cfo wouldn't
be so chill

773
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,073
about me deleting our
only, only asset.

774
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,356
I have a question.
Do we have a cfo?

775
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,238
No. Quick question,
do we need one?

776
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,073
Hmm, I think we should
probably focus

777
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,919
on coming up
with our next project,

778
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,719
one that makes us
a lot of money.

779
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,792
Yes. One that
can help people

780
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,554
but also not lead
to mass destruction.

781
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,790
If we have to.

782
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,634
Yes, we do. We must.

783
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,679
Hey, for what it's worth,
being overwatch

784
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,280
won't be your only legacy.

785
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,400
It'll be whatever you do
next here at Smoak Tech.

786
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,589
Because it's not Archer that was
destined to change the world.

787
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,514
It's you... Felicity Smoak.

788
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,750
Thank you.

789
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,640
All right, madame helmet,

790
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,558
let's see what
you're hiding.

791
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,154
Here goes nothing.

792
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,640
It seems like it worked.

793
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,995
That's not possible.

794
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
What is it?

795
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,096
This helmet is a satellite
to a much larger network.

796
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,952
Galaxy One was able
to expand Archer.

797
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,236
Hold on. I know big brother
getting bigger

798
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,996
isn't exactly great, but isn't Archer
just a surveillance program?

799
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,136
No, not if you
weaponize it.

800
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,216
Wearing one of these
would be like

801
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,416
wearing an a.I.
- Powered sixth sense.

802
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,319
Pair that with tech-enhanced
strength and agility.

803
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,198
<i>One of those troopers
was able to take out</i>

804
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,794
<i>half the canaries.</i>

805
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,556
<i>A whole army of them,
they'll be unstoppable.</i>

806
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,076
Acquiring that weapon
was a great victory,

807
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,755
but Oliver Queen is
still a threat.

808
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,696
You need to deal with your
brother before he jeopardizes

809
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,154
the last phase of
the plan.

810
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,999
I couldn't
agree more.

811
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,798
But first things
first.

812
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,440
You lied to me,
you betrayed me,

813
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,789
and you killed
my mother.

814
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,479
Emiko, you
don't understand.

815
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,200
Stop lying...

816
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,358
And tell me why.

817
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,672
She was the last reminder
of your former life.

818
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,672
Your mother was making
you weak

819
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,240
just like your father did.

820
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,835
And I needed you strong

821
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,313
to lead The Ninth Circle.

822
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,279
She was the only
family I had.

823
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,113
No, we are
your family.

824
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,193
Don't you see?
I did it for you.

825
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,156
This is for my mother.

826
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,720
Rot in hell.

827
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,634
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
