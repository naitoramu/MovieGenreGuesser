1
00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:02,280
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,850
After 5 years in Hell,

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,910
I returned home
with only one goal,

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,310
to save my city,

5
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:09,478
but my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,113
I had to become someone else.

7
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,883
I had to become
something else.

8
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:17,420
I had to become the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:18,921
Previously on "Arrow..."

10
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:20,456
Who's Lonnie Machin?

11
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,724
He's kind of
an ex-boyfriend of Thea's.

12
00:00:21,726 --> 00:00:24,727
Tell me where I can
find Damien Darhk.

13
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,330
You don't need another
man clouding your mind.

14
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:29,932
Alex, run!

15
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:32,268
No!

16
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,271
It's gone.

17
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:36,806
Darhk took it.

18
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:39,408
Lyla, you need to tell us
what Rubicon is.

19
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,810
Every NATO Ally--

20
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:43,145
Rubicon has control over
all their nuclear systems.

21
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:44,413
We have 12 hours
to stop it.

22
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:45,781
Darhk is powered
by death,

23
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,983
so if even one
of those nukes hits...

24
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:50,152
He will be unstoppable.

25
00:00:50,154 --> 00:00:52,088
We lost one.
It's in the air.

26
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:55,291
Direct hit on Havenrock.

27
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:56,625
How many causalities?

28
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:59,161
Tens of thousands.

29
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:02,932
Hello, Oliver.

30
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:04,400
Nice timing.

31
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:08,971
I think you're going to need
much bigger arrows.

32
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:13,776
Cool.

33
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:16,112
You know, I didn't
even mean to do that.

34
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:19,915
I turn steel arrows
into dust,

35
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,650
and you thought lead
would do the trick?

36
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:22,885
He's not human anymore.

37
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:24,553
Oh, I'm still human.

38
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:26,021
Just better.

39
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:28,090
Doesn't give you the right
to remake the world.

40
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:29,825
Why not?
It's been done before.

41
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:31,327
Noah and the flood.

42
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,797
People even worship
the responsible party.

43
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,807
This might smart
a little.

44
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:47,309
I'm pulling the oxygen
out of your bodies,

45
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,911
molecule by molecule,

46
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:50,146
but here's the good news.

47
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:51,380
I'm not going
to kill you.

48
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:52,982
Well, not right now,
at least.

49
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,950
Instead, I'm going
to regain control of Rubicon.

50
00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:56,285
That way,
when the whole world

51
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:57,853
goes all
"Dr. Strangelove,"

52
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:01,657
you can feel your skin
melt from Armageddon.

53
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:13,169
Oliver, let's go!

54
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:18,674
Come on!
We got to go now!

55
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:26,353

Come on.

58
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:54,476
What happened here?

59
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,111
Too bad.

60
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:57,479
I liked him for you.

61
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,882
Where's Machin?

62
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:02,484
I-I don't know.

63
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:04,787
He--he disappeared, ok?

64
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,256
I wasn't paying attention.

65
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:10,392
Why do I have trouble
believing you?

66
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,029
Let go of me!

67
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,798
Not to sound too much
like your father,

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,201
but I really think
you need a timeout.

69
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:23,806
Government officials
couldn't confirm the death toll.

70
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:25,841
However, various reports
place the number

71
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:27,910
in the tens of thousands.

72
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,346
Evacuation efforts
of the surrounding areas

73
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:31,614
continue as--

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,083
What are you doing?

75
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,351
We can't afford
to get caught up

76
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:36,585
in grief right now.

77
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:37,920
Now, I've bought us
24 hours

78
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,588
by sending Rubicon's
launch algorithms

79
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,823
into an infinite loop,

80
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,559
but if we can't find
a more permanent--

81
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,961
God, what am I doing?

82
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:47,263
It's ok, sweetheart.

83
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:48,631
Don't "sweetheart" me.

84
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,199
You don't get
to do that,

85
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,433
but you're right.

86
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,535
I can't get wrapped up
in this.

87
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,141
Have you been
watching the news?

88
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,709
I can't stop.

89
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:03,078
Ironically, last week
my mom was giving me a hard time

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,346
about living
in Star City.

91
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:05,614
Between the earthquakes,

92
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,082
the viral attacks,

93
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:08,317
the homicidal
super soldiers,

94
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,585
why would anyone
want to live here?

95
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,120
It turns out
we live in only

96
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:12,521
the second worst
place in America.

97
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:13,789
Curtis.

98
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,990
Oh. I'm sorry.

99
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:16,458
I didn't realize
you had company.

100
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,162
This is my father--
Noah Kuttler.

101
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:22,197
Noah Kuttler, huh?

102
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,465
Curtis.

103
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:24,667
You know, it's funny

104
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:25,968
because there's
this super hacker

105
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,169
who's wanted by the FBI

106
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:28,671
whose name is also
Noah Kuttler.

107
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:30,839
He's kind of a big deal
on the Dark Web.

108
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,508
Honestly, I thought
they could have used

109
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,978
a more flattering photo
for the wanted poster.

110
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,383
Wait, you--you're
the Noah Kuttler?

111
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:43,385
And if you're
Felicity's dad,

112
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,653
you were married
to Donna,

113
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:47,056
and you make so much
more sense now.

114
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,290
Yep.

115
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:49,792
This is--
it was a big mystery.

116
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,160
I was trying to figure
out, like, how Felic--

117
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:52,394
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

118
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:53,696
Ok. We have
work to do.

119
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:57,099
HIVE was behind
the Havenrock explosion.

120
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,901
They stole a cyber weapon
called Rubicon

121
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:00,135
and now are using it

122
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,370
to commandeer
the world's nukes,

123
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:03,572
so we have less than
24 hours to stop it,

124
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:04,973
or the world is
going to experience

125
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:06,508
the sequel
to "Wargames."

126
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,378
Actually, there was a direct-to-DVD
sequel in 2008,

127
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,713
but it was a bomb, too,

128
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:12,681
so that reference
still holds.

129
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,288
I have to go.

130
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,522
Don't worry.

131
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:24,760
Me and your fugitive
dad have got this.

132
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:29,932
He says, just realizing
he said that out loud.

133
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,171
Today was supposed
to be Christmas,

134
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:37,706
and I woke up
to a lump of coal.

135
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,342
Is it because I've been
naughty this year?

136
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,910
It's because Kuttler
and his daughter

137
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:43,445
are wrestling us
for Rubicon.

138
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:45,214
Which is why I felt
the need to up our game.

139
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:47,916
Mr. Seldon,
pleasure to see you.

140
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,451
Do you know what
the best part

141
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:50,786
about leading
a prison break is?

142
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:53,389
A long list of criminals
that owe you.

143
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:56,225
Amar, Brickwell,
and now Mr. Seldon.

144
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,260
It's like one-stop
shopping for thugs.

145
00:05:58,262 --> 00:05:59,728
I'm a hacker,
not a thug.

146
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,730
Oh, turns out
he and miss Smoak have a history.

147
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:03,265
Just your typical
boy meets girl,

148
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,600
boy falls in love
with girl,

149
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:07,136
boy goes to jail
for girl...

150
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:10,272
Boy tries to kill girl
for money.

151
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,474
Speaking of thugs,

152
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:15,811
we have a new problem
at Tevat Noah.

153
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:18,580
Not this guy again.

154
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:20,015
Don't worry, darling.

155
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:22,718
I'm dealing with him.

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,989
Give Mr. Machin
my love, my love.

157
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:32,094
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,068
A long-range ballistic
KN-08 missile

159
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,171
was responsible
for the nuclear blast

160
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:43,405
at Havenrock.

161
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,507
The Pentagon has not
further commented.

162
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:48,777
FEMA and city emergency
services personnel

163
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,045
continue
their quarantine...

164
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,280
What's going on?

165
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:52,548
What the hell happened
in Havenrock?

166
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,782
Darhk happened.

167
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:55,050
This city is
starting to panic.

168
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:56,285
Are they right to?

169
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,886
Felicity's got it
under control,

170
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,154
but my wife and her top secret
government agency's

171
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:00,422
looking for a more
permanent solution.

172
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,657
I cannot get in touch
with Thea!

173
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:03,258
It's ok.
She got ahold of me.

174
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,695
Thanks for not being dead.

175
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:07,963
Um, aren't we
all going to be

176
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,132
if you're away
from your computer?

177
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,533
Curtis and Kuttler are
dealing with Rubicon.

178
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:12,768
What did Thea say?

179
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,002
Do you know
where she is?

180
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:15,270
It's not good news.
HIVE has her.

181
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:16,538
Do you have
a location?

182
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,773
I'm tracing a signal.

183
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,007
I should have taken
more processors

184
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,275
from Palmer Tech
on my way out.

185
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:21,543
They made a mistake
letting you go.

186
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,278
They'll see it.

187
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,580
And if they don't,
I'm taking revenge plan suggestions.

188
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:25,948
Got it.

189
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,216
Thea's message came
from the intersection

190
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,450
of Berkeley and Childress,

191
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:29,685
right in the heart
of the Glades.

192
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:30,986
I thought you said
Thea and her boyfriend

193
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,187
went out of town.

194
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:33,489
I thought they did.
Let's go.

195
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:34,790
I-I'm coming with you.

196
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,158
I want you to stay here.
If this gets worse,

197
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,526
the city is going to need
someone to listen to

198
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:40,162
that they can trust.

199
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,170
What is it?

200
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:49,538
Say something.

201
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,006
Your eyes were glowing.

202
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,941
Like Reiter?

203
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,343
My God.

204
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:56,011
Oliver, what's
happening to me?

205
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:57,646
It--it--it doesn't matter.

206
00:07:57,648 --> 00:07:58,947
We will figure it out,
but for now we have to keep moving.

207
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,250
All right? Come on.

208
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:03,886
- Aah!
- Aah!

209
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:05,120
Oliver!

210
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:29,111
It's incredible.

211
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:33,615
I know now why Reiter
sought this power.

212
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,655
When you furrow
your brow like that,

213
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:41,056
you look just like Moira.

214
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:43,792
Don't you dare talk
about my mother.

215
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:46,128
Fine. Let's talk about
the future instead.

216
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,896
Genesis is coming.

217
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,565
With Machin
running around,

218
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:53,135
we can't have another
X-factor on the loose.

219
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:54,403
"We"?

220
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:57,072
Not the HIVE overlords?

221
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,308
Point being,
I need your word

222
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,577
that you won't
cause any trouble.

223
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,145
Or what?

224
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:04,479
Or I will have
to do something

225
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:05,881
to assure
your compliance

226
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:08,884
that I really don't
want to do.

227
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:11,353
Well, when there's
something I don't want to do,

228
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:15,057
I just get it over with.

229
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,065
This will make
everything better.

230
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,046
Overwatch, are you
sure this is the spot?

231
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:38,515
There's nothing here.

232
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:39,616
That's impossible.

233
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,185
Ok, not impossible,

234
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:42,653
but my back trace
on Thea's message

235
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,389
has a 99.9999%
accuracy rate,

236
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:48,158
so unless this is
part of the .0001 percentile...

237
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,526
It's just
an empty street.

238
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:51,895
Just look for anything
out of place, all right?

239
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:53,197
Whatever HIVE has built
is probably recent,

240
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:55,599
you know, new.

241
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,169
Is there supposed
to be sewer access on the street?

242
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,538
Not according
to city plans.

243
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,408
Stand by.

244
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:18,555
Help me with
something, Malcolm.

245
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:21,058
How is it again that
this juvenile annoyance

246
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,259
Lonnie Machin

247
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:23,560
is still a problem
for us?

248
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:24,795
Machin is exactly
what we--

249
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,063
Actually, I've
changed my mind.

250
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:27,331
I'm not interested
in excuses,

251
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,100
just results.

252
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:32,769
Yes?

253
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,071
Security, on radio:
Two hostiles have breached

254
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:35,272
the southeast entrance.

255
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:36,607
One in green,
the other in black.

256
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:38,408
Send a squad
and secure the entrance.

257
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,877
Green and black.

258
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,578
Oliver's come
for his baby sister, most likely.

259
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,580
And since she's only
here because of you,

260
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:46,416
I believe that makes
Mr. Queen your problem.

261
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,652
You have a lot on
your plate, Malcolm.

262
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,354
I suggest you
get started.

263
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:53,090
Come on, sweetie.

264
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,529
How did HIVE
build all this

265
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:00,797
without anyone knowing?

266
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,165
Well, doesn't hurt
having someone

267
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,600
controlling the city's
infrastructure.

268
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:04,935
Can't find any public
blueprints on file

269
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:06,136
for an underground lair

270
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:08,572
with a creepy
sewer entrance.

271
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,243
Believe me...

272
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:16,046
There are no public
blueprints for this.

273
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:17,347
Unbelievable.

274
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:19,683
Just like Mount Weather.

275
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,952
Continuity
of government facility

276
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:23,453
built by FEMA
during the cold war,

277
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:25,689
in case of
a nuclear attack.

278
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,157
I think that we
found the ark

279
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,792
that HIVE's been building.

280
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,898
What?

281
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,166
I lost their signal.

282
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,068
Well, get it back.

283
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:44,975
I have to get back
to Curtis and Kuttler.

284
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:46,443
All right.
I'll cover comms.

285
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:49,846
I hear anything,
I'll patch you in.

286
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:53,383
What's the emergency?

287
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:54,651
Is Rubicon still
stabilized?

288
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:55,886
Where is Kuttler?
Did he do something?

289
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,287
Did he--are you
drinking a beer?

290
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:00,157
I knew that being a child
of divorce was hard,

291
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,859
but what I did not
have any idea about

292
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,061
was all the yelling,

293
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:06,830
the name-calling,
the loudness.

294
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:09,666
- You poor thing, poor thing.
- Oh, oh.

295
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:10,901
What are you
talking about?

296
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:12,202
Oh, God,
do you even listen?

297
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:14,237
So I'm here to take
her away from you?

298
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,672
Get out--get out
of my brain.

299
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:17,074
Can we not
with her here?

300
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:18,308
She's here.
Just calm down.

301
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,509
This really is
the end of the world.

302
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:20,644
When you tell someone
to calm down...

303
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:21,979
It actually
does the opposite.

304
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:23,914
Baby, I've been
so worried about you.

305
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,816
Oh, my God.

306
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:27,250
Do you know
I have called?

307
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,820
I have called you
a million times, baby.

308
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:31,254
I have been calling
and calling.

309
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,056
- Are you ok?
- I am. I'm fine.

310
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:34,358
Just been a little
distracted.

311
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,592
With your father?

312
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:38,562
Thanks for telling me.

313
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:39,763
I don't know.

314
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,064
Everything just
happened so fast.

315
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,033
What has?

316
00:12:43,035 --> 00:12:44,868
Sit down.

317
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:49,172
What? What?

318
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:51,408
I have to tell you
something.

319
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,010
Oh!

320
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:54,678
I'm going to be
a grandma!

321
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,946
I'm going to be
a grandma!

322
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:57,180
Oh, no, no, no.

323
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,715
No, no, no.
No, you're not.

324
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:00,017
I knew you had more
than a bad burrito the other day.

325
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,752
I knew it was
more than that.

326
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,220
Ok. No.

327
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:04,454
Baby! Baby!

328
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,223
I am not pregnant.

329
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:08,458
Is that the only news
that a woman can have?

330
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,860
The world is under attack,

331
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:12,529
and I need my fa--I need
Noah to help me stop it.

332
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:15,198
Honey, what happened
in Havenrock is horrible,

333
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,768
but that doesn't
mean the world is going to end.

334
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,002
She's telling the truth.

335
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,237
You know, I know--

336
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,471
which she clearly
gets from my side

337
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:22,906
of the family,
thank you.

338
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:24,207
You know, I know
when my daughter is lying, ok?

339
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,442
There were
plenty of times

340
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:26,710
when she was
a teenager,

341
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:28,311
not that you
would know.

342
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:29,546
Here we go.

343
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,348
For once, this
isn't about you, Dee.

344
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,983
- Oh, you're calling me "Dee"?
- There are nuclear missiles...

345
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,551
- Are you calling me "Dee"?
- Targeted all across the globe.

346
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,453
Somebody stick
something sharp in my eye.

347
00:13:36,455 --> 00:13:37,754
What happened in Havenrock is going to
happen to the entire world.

348
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:39,156
Unless we stop it,
which we will.

349
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,724
Sweetie, why do you
even think

350
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,325
this is something
that you can--

351
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:45,629
because I work with
the Green Arrow, Mom.

352
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,466
For how long?

353
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:50,734
3 years.

354
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,370
And you've been
keeping this from me?

355
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,172
Yes.

356
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:56,506
Wow, I guess
you and your father

357
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,841
are more alike
than I thought.

358
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,142
Mom.

359
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:00,811
We can talk about it
later, hon, after you...

360
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:04,147
Save the world.

361
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:09,319
- Oh.
- Yeah.

362
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:12,622
The world's two best
hackers side by side.

363
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:15,025
This is history.

364
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:19,362
I mean, it's--
it's no biggie.

365
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:32,542
It's crazy.

366
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:33,944
Take away the psychos
in the smocks...

367
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:35,312
And it might as well
be Ivy Town.

368
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:37,047
Everyone looks
so happy.

369
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,548
Happy's easy
when you're mindless

370
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,317
on some little
yellow pill.

371
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:43,186
Let's just assume we
weren't invited over for casserole.

372
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,488
What's our play?

373
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,356
We split up
and find Thea.

374
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:47,991
Scope the houses
on the north.

375
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:50,560
I'll head south.

376
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:51,795
Good afternoon.

377
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:54,464
Today is a brisk
and sunny 85 degrees.

378
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:56,561
It is a lovely day
to be outside.

379
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,897
As we all enjoy Tevat Noah,

380
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,199
I want to take this moment
to express my gratitude.

381
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,336
I want to thank
each and every one...

382
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,802
I've got eyes on Thea.

383
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:20,037
Fourth house down.

384
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,406
There are two
hostiles with her.

385
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:28,379
Speedy, let's get
you out of here.

386
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:30,714
Are you all right?

387
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:40,090
I have the intruder.

388
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:43,427
Move, and I will kill you.

389
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:52,511
Thea...

390
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:54,513
Don't move.

391
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:55,948
Listen to me.

392
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,419
You're not thinking clearly.

393
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:01,720
In her defense,

394
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:04,389
she's a little drugged
at the moment.

395
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:09,194
I should have
taken your head.

396
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:10,529
That's always been
your problem...

397
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:14,733
An inability to do
what is necessary.

398
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:18,470
Laurel is dead
because of you.

399
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:20,072
What are you going to do?

400
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,107
We've already established

401
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:26,478
you're not going
to kill me.

402
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:46,164
What the hell?

403
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,432
It's the yellow pills.

404
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:48,800
Son of a bitch.

405
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:51,937
They're there!
On the porch!

406
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,406
We got to go.
Let's move!

407
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:56,802
Not that it's not scintillating
to watch you type,

408
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:58,837
but when exactly will
I have Rubicon back?

409
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,140
Hacking isn't as easy
as waving your hand.

410
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:03,475
Oh, point taken.

411
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:05,911
So you and Felicity Smoak.

412
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:09,114
I just don't see it.

413
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:13,618
She used to be
a lot different.

414
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:20,392
All clear.

415
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:21,827
Looks like we bought
ourselves a few minutes.

416
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,295
John, this place
is enormous.

417
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:24,663
I don't know how we're
going to find Thea.

418
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:25,864
Just have to make sure

419
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:28,333
that the Ghosts
don't find us.

420
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:33,338
So much for "clear."

421
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,309
We're not going
to hurt you.

422
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:39,745
Then what are
the weapons for?

423
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:41,813
There's a woman being
held against her will.

424
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:44,616
We're just here
to bring her home.

425
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:45,917
Ruvé, on TV:
Citizens of Tevat Noah,

426
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,285
I have disturbing news.

427
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:48,687
We are under attack

428
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:50,088
from a man in a green hood

429
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,857
and another in a black helmet.

430
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,192
Do not let them
disrupt Genesis.

431
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:58,163
These individuals are not
an affront to our home

432
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:01,400
but to our future
and the futures of our children.

433
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:05,270
Find them and kill them.

434
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,441
Oh, no.

435
00:19:09,443 --> 00:19:10,909
It's ok, Oliver.

436
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,944
I know what to do now.

437
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:18,250
I finally understand
what Reiter was after.

438
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,585
Taiana,
Reiter was insane.

439
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:21,787
Why?

440
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,588
He said after his village
was destroyed,

441
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,624
he would never be
powerless again.

442
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:28,894
I have a village, too,
Krasnoyarsk,

443
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:31,997
run by a government
strongman named Kovar.

444
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,365
Taiana...

445
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,766
Now I know why fate has
led me to this place--

446
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:38,437
to give me the strength
to free my home.

447
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,638
Ok. All right.

448
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,573
You'll go back
to Russia,

449
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,643
and--and you can
take on this Kovar,

450
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:47,679
but right now there
are people here

451
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:49,614
that need our help.

452
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:53,585
What would Vlad
want you to do?

453
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:58,623
What would your brother
expect you to do?

454
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,459
Find these hostiles
at once.

455
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:02,227
Nothing can be permitted

456
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,196
to stand in the way
of Genesis.

457
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:06,565
Thank you.

458
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,233
I'm not sure
murdering vigilantes

459
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:12,971
is what your
loyal supporters signed up for.

460
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:14,339
Well, you better hope

461
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,208
that they don't find
Mr. Queen and Mr. Diggle

462
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,509
before you do, Malcolm,

463
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:19,177
or I'll be forced
to seriously question

464
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:22,614
what your purpose here is.

465
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:29,788
Every time I knock down
a firewall,

466
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,189
5 more pop back up.

467
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:32,457
It would seem
that Mr. Darhk

468
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,792
has a counter-hacker
in his employ.

469
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,026
And he's good.

470
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,294
Yeah.

471
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:37,529
Ok.

472
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:38,763
I might have something.

473
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:40,098
Now, until the FBI
gets their way,

474
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
smartphones are protected
by encryption.

475
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:43,368
If you don't enter
your passcode

476
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,603
after enough times,

477
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,538
then the device
bricks itself, right?

478
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,839
Curtis, I don't even
have the time

479
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:49,140
to tell you that
I don't have the time.

480
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,375
You just did.

481
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:51,977
But here's the point.

482
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:53,345
Instead of trying
to break Rubicon's encryption...

483
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:54,913
We make it stop working
in the first place.

484
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:56,214
You're suggesting
as it is with a smartphone...

485
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:57,449
We overload Rubicon

486
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,717
with too many
access requests.

487
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,951
And it shuts itself down.

488
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,286
Unfortunately,
I doubt very much

489
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,621
that Argus would leave
Rubicon so vulnerable

490
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:05,257
to such a brute
force attack.

491
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:06,558
Let them try.

492
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,327
You're always such
a stick in the mud.

493
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:10,529
Yes!

494
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:12,330
Let's all take
hacking advice

495
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,833
from a woman whose only use
for her smartphone

496
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:16,401
is as a mirror.

497
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:19,838
Ho ho! Ha! So funny.
Ha ha!

498
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,306
Not.

499
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:23,808
Felicity may have gotten
her brains from you,

500
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,745
but she got her
creativity from moi.

501
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,381
Matching lipstick
to lip liner

502
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:30,682
isn't creativity,

503
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,551
and while I may not be
father of the year...

504
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:33,919
Oh, try the past
two decades.

505
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:36,421
I recently took a bullet
for our daughter.

506
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:38,156
Not metaphorically,
either.

507
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:39,424
By the way, a metaphor,
it's a--it's a--it's a--

508
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:41,026
Oh, I know what
a metaphor means,

509
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:42,561
just like I know what abandoning
your family looks like.

510
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:43,895
Really?

511
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:45,196
Because I remember not
having much of a choice

512
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,598
in the matter.

513
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,201
Uh, Felicity?

514
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:51,436
Cooper, on monitors:
Hello, Felicity.

515
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:53,238
- Remember me?
- Cooper.

516
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,906
Your system is now
under my control,

517
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:57,943
just like Rubicon will
be in the next 5 minutes.

518
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,612
Once again, you lose.

519
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:02,347
- Oh...Frak.
- Oh...Frak.

520
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:08,412
Who is this guy, again?

521
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:11,314
Cooper Seldon,
her ex-boyfriend.

522
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:12,649
How could I forget?

523
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:13,917
I thought he was dead,
and just came back evil.

524
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,952
Oliver, Dr. Palmer,
this guy.

525
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:18,188
You really have
a complicated romantic history.

526
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,190
Not the best
time, Curtis.

527
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:23,293
Be honest, Felicity,
hacker to hacker.

528
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:25,062
You prefer it this way,
don't you?

529
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:26,363
As it was meant to be?

530
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:29,332
Once more unto breach...

531
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:32,803
Is he seriously going full
"Star Trek VI" on you?

532
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:34,271
He shut our system
down with a virus.

533
00:22:34,273 --> 00:22:36,206
It's an x-axis
binumeric algorithm.

534
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,908
I know. I created it
in college.

535
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,543
Wait. How did you know?

536
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:41,311
Just because I wasn't
in your life

537
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:45,048
doesn't mean I wasn't keeping tabs
on my daughter.

538
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,022
He's sending
electrical surges

539
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:55,358
- to all our previous IPs...
- Aah!

540
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:58,829
Whatever it is,
it's working.

541
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:00,197
It is, but it's pinging
back to his location.

542
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,531
You thinking what
I'm thinking?

543
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:02,966
We hitch our own code
on to the back trace.

544
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:04,501
Curtis, your Rubicon
lockout idea.

545
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:06,069
How long till you can
get me an executable?

546
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,004
Uh...20 seconds.

547
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:09,773
Great.

548
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:11,007
If this works,

549
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,242
it will send
the latest surge

550
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:13,510
back to its point
of origin,

551
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:14,878
triggering Rubicon
to lock itself out.

552
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,179
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

553
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,081
Just get the son of a bitch.

554
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,250
Locked and...

555
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:21,551
Loaded.

556
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:23,587
Got you.

557
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,857
Oh, no.

558
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:29,559
What is it?

559
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,429
To be, or not to be...

560
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,407
Did it work?

561
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:45,408
I think it worked.

562
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,610
It worked.

563
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:47,878
Well, the power's
still on.

564
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,146
That's--that's good,
right?

565
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:50,413
Rubicon's offline.

566
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,015
Ha ha ha!

567
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:53,517
He's going to need more than
some third-rate hacker

568
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,751
to get it
back up again,

569
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,720
all because of you,
sweetheart.

570
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:58,522
Thanks, Dad.

571
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,464
Mom?

572
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:21,578
Streets are filled.

573
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,446
Ruvé's mobilized
the entire ark

574
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,615
looking for us.

575
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:27,017
They're in here!

576
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:28,285
Oh!

577
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:29,519
Quiet.

578
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:30,787
You can't win.

579
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,322
You can't stop Genesis.

580
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:33,590
Well, what are you going
to do when you're not here

581
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:34,925
to enjoy your
brave new world?

582
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:36,159
Spartan.

583
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:38,962
Easy.

584
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:41,464
He almost got us killed.

585
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:42,666
They're like Thea.

586
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:43,967
They're not in
their right minds.

587
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:45,202
You mean the pills?

588
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:46,870
We haven't taken any.

589
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:48,705
Not even one.

590
00:24:48,707 --> 00:24:49,940
None of us have.

591
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:53,443
We're here
because we believe,

592
00:24:53,445 --> 00:24:58,515
because we know
the world is evil and darkness.

593
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:00,016
It's beyond saving.

594
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:01,818
How can you
believe that?

595
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,320
Because we've lived it.

596
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:06,122
Every day.

597
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:11,361
So many promises were
made to save the city,

598
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:13,697
but it all just
fell apart,

599
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:19,135
and we were the ones
left in the rubble.

600
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:23,273
Damien Darhk
has given us hope.

601
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:26,543
Can you with your
masks and your guns

602
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:30,213
actually say the same?

603
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:55,472
There's a plane
due east.

604
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,007
Stay here. We'll hold off
Reiter's men.

605
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:58,842
Taiana, help me
with this guy.

606
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:00,076
He's alive.

607
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:01,344
Hey. He's alive.

608
00:26:01,346 --> 00:26:02,579
Help me with him.

609
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:03,847
He's too bad.

610
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,048
He'll only slow us,

611
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,383
keep us from
helping the others.

612
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,551
We're not just going
to leave him here.

613
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,786
You're right.

614
00:26:09,788 --> 00:26:11,087
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

615
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,322
What are you doing?

616
00:26:12,324 --> 00:26:13,723
His death
is inevitable.

617
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:16,860
Why waste his life when
it can make me stronger?

618
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:34,577
What are you doing
with my clothes?

619
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:39,082
When I get stressed,
I--I like to fold.

620
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:40,550
Yeah. I know.

621
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:41,785
When you two
were married,

622
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:44,788
it was like
living at the Gap.

623
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,256
Hey, what did Noah mean
when he said

624
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:47,557
that he didn't have much
choice in the matter

625
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,793
when he left?

626
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:53,997
I always just assumed
he disappeared.

627
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,234
He didn't disappear, hon.

628
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,072
I did.

629
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:04,975
We did.

630
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:06,242
I had a 7-year-old daughter,

631
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:07,811
and I know all
about gambling,

632
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,212
and I wasn't willing
to take the bet

633
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:14,617
that your father
could possibly change.

634
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,654
He let me believe
that he abandoned us.

635
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:20,056
Well, I don't...

636
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:23,860
I don't know what to say
about that, hon.

637
00:27:23,862 --> 00:27:25,729
I mean, I think...

638
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:29,332
I think he just
didn't want you

639
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:31,501
to lose your mom, too.

640
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:34,838
Hey, look at me.

641
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,141
I didn't lose you.

642
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:39,676
Did I?

643
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:43,480
Never.

644
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:46,149
I'm sorry.

645
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:07,237
Do you ever think
that maybe Darhk has a point?

646
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:09,406
No, Darhk is psychotic.

647
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:11,508
Everyone down here is.

648
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,742
Are they?

649
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:15,278
He's not wrong.

650
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,148
The world is coming apart
just like Star City.

651
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,117
I mean, it is worse
than it has ever been.

652
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,719
That's because Darhk's
been spending the past year

653
00:28:22,721 --> 00:28:24,020
trying to kill it.

654
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,822
Then why is he giving
these people more hope

655
00:28:25,824 --> 00:28:27,857
than we ever could?

656
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:31,528
Go! Go in the bedroom!

657
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,762
Take cover!

658
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:34,030
Go! Move, move, move!

659
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:35,265
I'll hold them off.

660
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:36,533
Go find Thea.

661
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:37,767
Go, now!

662
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,710
Thea.

663
00:29:12,174 --> 00:29:14,808
This isn't you, Thea.

664
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,744
They are trying
to control you,

665
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:18,245
but you are stronger
than that.

666
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:22,182
You can fight
through it.

667
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:23,884
I can't.

668
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:25,085
Yes, you can.

669
00:29:25,087 --> 00:29:27,721
Every day we stand
side by side

670
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,023
to protect this city,

671
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:31,191
and no matter how dark
or how hopeless,

672
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:33,093
you always keep fighting.

673
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:34,361
You never give up!

674
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,263
I refuse to believe

675
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:39,166
that you're going
to give up now.

676
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:44,571
So fight!

677
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:09,463
Drug me again,

678
00:30:09,465 --> 00:30:13,067
and I will kill you,
you son of a bitch.

679
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:18,939
Hi, everyone.

680
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,274
Uncle Lonnie here.

681
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,776
See, I just absolutely

682
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:24,778
adore your little
community.

683
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,347
It's so welcoming
to outsiders,

684
00:30:26,349 --> 00:30:30,784
but it's so...structured.

685
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:34,855
Going to have
to fix that.

686
00:30:34,857 --> 00:30:37,591
Mr. Darhk, remember me?

687
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:41,895
The loyal servant
you rejected, betrayed?

688
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:44,765
In 20 minutes,
I'm going to kill someone.

689
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:48,435
It can be your wife...

690
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:52,940
Oh, but, Damien,
you're my first choice.

691
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,409
Ball's in your court, buddy.

692
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:57,845
Oh, and be quick
about it,

693
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:59,346
because in 21 minutes,

694
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:02,483
I'm going to blow
your little underground world

695
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,151
into next week.

696
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,254
Ok?

697
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,128
So Machin is down here?

698
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,096
An ongoing pest we've
yet to exterminate.

699
00:31:21,098 --> 00:31:23,132
He killed Alex,
who brought me here

700
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:24,433
because Ruvé
drugged him

701
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:26,635
just like
you did to me.

702
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,637
We can discuss my parenting
philosophy later.

703
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:30,706
Mr. Machin is
the immediate threat.

704
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,241
To Darhk and his wife,

705
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:33,776
and I still don't understand
why we should care.

706
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:35,010
Because he has
already tried once

707
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:36,478
to kill everyone
down here.

708
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,813
Malcolm's right.

709
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:41,049
We're not letting
anyone else die.

710
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,519
This place isn't safe.

711
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:44,820
I need you to get your
family out of here

712
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,488
in order
to protect them.

713
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,991
Please.

714
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:53,729
Now, you know the way out,

715
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:55,998
so if we can't stop Machin,

716
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,333
then you are going
to lead the evacuation.

717
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:01,570
I don't recall
volunteering.

718
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:05,874
And even if I did,

719
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:09,044
where exactly would
I evacuate them to?

720
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:10,679
Everything above our heads

721
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,081
is going to be under
a mushroom cloud.

722
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,217
I refuse to believe that.

723
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:17,419
Because you're a fool.

724
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:20,189
Because I have hope.

725
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:25,694
Let's go.

726
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:35,037
Taiana, I am not just
going to let you kill this man.

727
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,738
I'm the only one
who can stop Reiter.

728
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,973
This is how.

729
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:40,275
I need that man's power.

730
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:41,543
Listen to yourself!

731
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:43,011
This isn't you.

732
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:44,613
Whatever that idol is doing,
it is warping your mind.

733
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:45,881
No.

734
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,115
I've never been clearer.

735
00:32:47,117 --> 00:32:49,818
Now get out of my way!

736
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:56,492
No, don't!

737
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,934
Deja vu all over again.

738
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,135
You as the bait,

739
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:08,770
me waiting to kill
your husband.

740
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:13,408
You know, I really hope
I get it right this time.

741
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:19,248
You have no idea the power
that you're up against.

742
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,549
Look at you.

743
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:22,751
No longer
the whimpering victim.

744
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:25,787
Mommy's so strong
and impressive.

745
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:27,890
Isn't she?

746
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:29,591
You do realize that
you're planning

747
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,426
to destroy
the last safe place

748
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,663
left on the entire
planet, right?

749
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,598
I'm sorry.

750
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:39,268
Did I leave you
with the impression

751
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,838
that I was
a rational guy?

752
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,873
Unh!

753
00:33:49,513 --> 00:33:51,680
That's my mommy.

754
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:53,048
Isn't she pretty?

755
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,716
Oh, and she brought
her friends.

756
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:55,984
This is over.

757
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:57,185
More like under.

758
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:58,453
I tinkered with
the engineering here.

759
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,689
This whole place
is powered

760
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:02,291
by a dwarf star alloy.

761
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:04,326
Very powerful
but a little touchy,

762
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:06,662
so you might want
to be careful where you aim

763
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:10,599
because a stray shot
could blow this whole place.

764
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,671
We're not letting
you out of here.

765
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:16,905
Oh.

766
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:19,041
Well, in that case...

767
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:30,252
Unh!

768
00:34:45,936 --> 00:34:48,337
Unless you want to die,
let's go!

769
00:35:20,804 --> 00:35:22,771
Bye, mommy.

770
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:36,018
There's no time.

771
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:42,324
Save my daughter.

772
00:35:42,326 --> 00:35:44,493
Please.

773
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:46,995
Promise me.

774
00:35:46,997 --> 00:35:49,231
I promise.

775
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:55,303
We need to get out of here,
like, right now.

776
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:12,621
Finally,
electric boogaloo awakes.

777
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:15,424
Sir, there's something
happening at Tevat Noah.

778
00:36:39,974 --> 00:36:41,474
Well, it looks like
the real estate value

779
00:36:41,476 --> 00:36:44,243
of the Glades
just went up.

780
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,078
It's called
gallows humor.

781
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,480
What about
everybody else?

782
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:50,282
I saw Merlyn leading
some evacuations.

783
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:51,650
There must be
other access points.

784
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:53,853
Or Malcolm's
underneath all that.

785
00:36:55,823 --> 00:36:58,090
What about her?

786
00:36:58,092 --> 00:36:59,391
Is anyone there?

787
00:36:59,393 --> 00:37:00,993
Green Arrow,
Spartan, Speedy?

788
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:02,795
Hell, I'd take
Malcolm Merlyn at this point.

789
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:04,263
We're all safe.

790
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,931
Where are you
with Rubicon?

791
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,300
HIVE's locked out.
We're good.

792
00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:12,872
The city's safe...

793
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:19,178
You sound like there's
a "but" to that sentence.

794
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,448
People still
need saving.

795
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,718
They still need hope.

796
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,620
Give it back!

797
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:28,854
Taiana, if you
want it back,

798
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:31,090
you're going to have
to kill me,

799
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,925
and I'm betting
you won't.

800
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:35,327
What about me, Mr. Queen?

801
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,562
And after killing you...

802
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:39,598
I'll kill her.

803
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:57,249
Tell me.

804
00:37:57,251 --> 00:38:00,519
It was Machin. He's--

805
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:03,155
Ruvé?

806
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:07,259
I'm sorry.

807
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:10,529
My daughter?

808
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:12,498
We're still getting
reports of survivors.

809
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,200
We're locked out
of Rubicon.

810
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:15,467
Momentarily.

811
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:17,770
I know someone who can
get us back online.

812
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:19,038
Damien.

813
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,673
Tevat Noah is gone.

814
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,041
It's buried
under miles of ash.

815
00:38:22,043 --> 00:38:25,177
Even if you could regain
control of Rubicon,

816
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:28,380
there'd be no place
on earth that is safe.

817
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,388
If there's no place left
on earth that's safe...

818
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,993
Let it all burn.

819
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,503
All right, I'm listening.

820
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:52,838
Though, if you could
keep the lecture short,

821
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:54,740
- I'd appreciate it.
- No lecture.

822
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:56,242
Just a request.

823
00:38:56,244 --> 00:38:57,710
Ah-ha.

824
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,982
Leave, and this time...

825
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:04,950
Don't come back.

826
00:39:04,952 --> 00:39:06,385
- What?
- You helped Felicity tonight.

827
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,153
Maybe it was because
you'd be nuked, too.

828
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:10,422
Maybe it was a broken clock
being right for once.

829
00:39:10,424 --> 00:39:12,891
Either way, we both
know it wasn't you.

830
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:16,862
- Dee...
- You know who you are.

831
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:22,201
Are you really going
to stand here--

832
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:26,639
Heh--and tell me
that you've changed?

833
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,411
You're every bit
as dangerous to our daughter

834
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:36,382
as the day
I took her from you.

835
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:42,554
If you care about her,
you will walk away.

836
00:39:42,556 --> 00:39:44,657
After everything
that's happened,

837
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:45,958
she'll be crushed.

838
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,326
She'll survive.

839
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:48,761
She's strong.

840
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:51,297
She's my daughter.

841
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:56,468
You can lie to her,
but can you lie to yourself?

842
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:00,439
Can you really believe
that leaving

843
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:05,544
isn't the best
thing for her?

844
00:40:05,546 --> 00:40:07,413
What do you
think your parents are talking about?

845
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:08,647
I'm trying not
to think about it.

846
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:10,649
Maybe they're
discussing that thing

847
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:11,850
that Noah said before

848
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:14,253
about not having
much of a choice.

849
00:40:14,255 --> 00:40:15,654
That's exactly what I'm
trying not to think about.

850
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:16,922
- Felicity...
- Mm-hmm.

851
00:40:16,924 --> 00:40:18,324
I helped you
save the world.

852
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:19,692
The least you can do is
give me a little gossip.

853
00:40:19,694 --> 00:40:20,926
Ok, fine.

854
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:25,064
So apparently
my dad didn't leave.

855
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,865
My mom kicked him out.

856
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:28,801
Did she tell you why?

857
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:31,136
I think she didn't want
to risk him hurting me.

858
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,639
I mean, he could promise
whatever he wanted,

859
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:37,042
but he was a criminal--
is a criminal.

860
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:40,913
So he inevitably would have
gone back to his old habits.

861
00:40:40,915 --> 00:40:43,082
Mm-hmm.

862
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:44,883
What does that mean?

863
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:47,219
It just sounds
familiar, that's all.

864
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:49,988
The criminal who you
don't think can change,

865
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,992
the slightly overactive
but understandable breakup.

866
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:56,528
Just saying,
you and Oliver,

867
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,531
Donna and Noah.

868
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:03,969
Where's Noah?

869
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:06,672
He's going away
for a little while.

870
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:10,576
That's what you
told me when I was 7.

871
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:13,946
Boo hoo.

872
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:16,582
Are you getting all weepy?

873
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:18,183
Do you need a moment?

874
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,185
No? Good.

875
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,587
Because I need you
to do me a favor.

876
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:24,456
Go to hell.

877
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,225
Why bother?

878
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:29,561
I'm going to
bring it to us.

879
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:36,582

<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>

880
00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:56,172
Greg!
Move your head.
