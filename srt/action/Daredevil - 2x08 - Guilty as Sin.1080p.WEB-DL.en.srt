1
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:18,691
There.

2
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:20,150
It just hit.

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,530
It's gotta be 40 stories, at least.

4
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:27,658
Down!

5
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:33,496
They're on all sides.
Half a dozen, at least.

6
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,373
- I got a problem.
- Right with you.

7
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:37,125
No, you don't get it.
I can't get a read on these guys.

8
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:38,794
There's no sound, there's no heartbeat,
there's nothing.

9
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:40,629
- They're trained to hide themselves.
- How do you know?

10
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:42,715
Don't focus on the fighters,
track their weapons.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,910
- They have swords.
- They have swords, I can hear.

12
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,598
Elektra, no!

13
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:50,532
Matthew...

14
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,276
So...

15
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:32,574
who wants to get the hell out of here?

16
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:45,856
She's losing too much blood.

17
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,982
Hell of a scrape.

18
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:48,441
Where are you taking her?

19
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:51,779
They're still coming.
Fast little shits.

20
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,365
- Who are they, Stick?
- Bad time to chat.

21
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:29,691
- Matty!
- On it!

22
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:35,447
- Watch your ass.
- Yeah.

23
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,287
No, no, no.
No, she's dying.

24
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,581
- Stick, she's dying.
- Not if I can stop it.

25
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,833
We need to get her to a hospital.

26
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,501
Doctors can't help her.
I can.

27
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:50,587
We're going to your place.
It's her only shot.

28
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,673
Sweetie, stay with me.
Stay with me.

29
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,300
Second wave.
Brace her.

30
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:12,067
End of that batch.

31
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,487
There'll be more.

32
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,866
Always more.

33
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,005
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is bad.

34
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:35,090
What's happening to her?

35
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:36,841
You got baking soda?

36
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:38,385
Yeah, in the fridge, why?

37
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:41,721
To neutralize the acid
in the toilet bowl cleaner.

38
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,474
Plus whiskey, pliers, black tea.

39
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,601
Tell me what's going on, Stick.

40
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:48,770
Do you wanna talk
or save your girlfriend?

41
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:55,485
Her heart's skipping.

42
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,905
Whiskey.

43
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:02,659
The toxins in her bloodstream
are shutting everything down.

44
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:03,785
Is she gonna live?

45
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,245
Baking soda?

46
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:08,665
I thought you got it.

47
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:13,795
Matthew!

48
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:16,339
I need pliers and hot tea.

49
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,053
The pliers are behind you.

50
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:35,650
Matthew...

51
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,569
I'm here.
I'm here.

52
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,948
If I die...

53
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,201
No, you're not gonna die.
You hear me?

54
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,994
Elektra, look at me.

55
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:48,371
Hey, hey, focus on me.

56
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,623
Breathe. Breathe.

57
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:52,292
That's good. That's good.

58
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,710
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:56,046
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

60
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,297
Bring her in here!

61
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,631
Yeah.

62
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,179
One, two, three.

63
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,108
- Clean sheets.
- Yeah.

64
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,405
Can you save her?

65
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,324
Not before I make her worse.

66
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:27,410
Oh, Jesus!
Stick, take it easy!

67
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,496
Those blades were poisoned.

68
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,039
She'll be dead in 20 minutes

69
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,833
if I don't pull some serious
juju out of my ass.

70
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,710
Make the goddamn tea!

71
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,715
Easy.

72
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,063
Easy. Easy, young lady.
I'm right here.

73
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:05,086
...forgive those who trespass against us.

74
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,910
Matty, use that hearing of yours.

75
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,704
How's her heart rate?

76
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:19,254
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.
It's steady.

77
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:22,590
Sheets.

78
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:31,683
Not too neat...

79
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:34,769
but...

80
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:36,563
it'll do.

81
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:37,730
Tea?

82
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:45,988
Thank you.

83
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,034
Ah...

84
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,442
She'll recover?

85
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,986
Twenty-four hours will tell.

86
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,905
I've known her to pull through worse.

87
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,284
What'd you just say?

88
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:34,537
Ellie's a real fighter.
Always has been.

89
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:38,375
You... You know her?

90
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,293
I didn't mention that?

91
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,505
What the hell's going on?
How do you know Elektra?

92
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:45,590
- I'm not done in there.
- I want some answers!

93
00:09:45,673 --> 00:09:46,758
Everybody wants something.

94
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:49,969
- Do you want me to throw you out?
- Not unless you want her to die.

95
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,020
Sit down, Matty.

96
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:02,774
<i>Where is he?</i>

97
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,112
Um, I may have told him
just to stay home today.

98
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:08,655
You what?

99
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,440
He wasn't actually supposed to do it.

100
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,282
Whoa, whoa, Foggy,
what the hell happened yesterday?

101
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:14,708
I can't do this alone.

102
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,418
I didn't even wanna take this case.

103
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,585
- It'll be okay, I...
- The whole city is watching.

104
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:20,955
If I screw up, I'd never work again.

105
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,791
And, frankly, you'd probably never work
again, either, by association, which...

106
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:26,676
Stop, Foggy. Stop thinking
about screwing up, about losing.

107
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,133
You need to think about winning.

108
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,845
Colonel Ray Schoonover,
United States Marine Corps.

109
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,556
Do you swear to tell the truth,

110
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,809
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

111
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:39,477
I do.

112
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,816
You got this.

113
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,484
Counsel?

114
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,661
Colonel, how long have you
known the defendant?

115
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:59,080
I'd say, the better part of a decade.

116
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:00,832
Most of his career in the Marine Corps.

117
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:03,710
So you're familiar with his service
in the Middle East?

118
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,545
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran?

119
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:07,672
Yes, very familiar.

120
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:10,007
I wonder if you could tell us

121
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:12,927
how Lieutenant Frank Castle
won the Navy Cross?

122
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,348
Due to the nature of that mission,
you'll have to understand that

123
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:18,600
the precise circumstances are classified.

124
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,605
Um...

125
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,817
How about the part that's not?

126
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,153
Lieutenant Frank Castle
was part of a small team.

127
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:33,323
He was conducting
a close target reconnaissance

128
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,450
in the vicinity of the Hindu Kush.

129
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:39,704
The mission became compromised,
taking enemy contact on three sides.

130
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:44,083
Lieutenant Castle wanted to abort.

131
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,087
Said the mission was a bust,
pulling the plug would save lives.

132
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,007
- Officer in charge said "no."
- And why was that?

133
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,175
Maybe he wanted
more medals on his chest.

134
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,428
Doesn't matter.
Either way, Frank was right.

135
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:58,890
They were cut off, boxed into a canyon.

136
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:00,933
And what happened next?

137
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:03,811
Within the first hour,
the officer in charge of that mission

138
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,855
got his arm blown off.

139
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:08,190
So Lieutenant Castle assumed command.

140
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:11,319
His only goal was to get
his men out alive.

141
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:14,531
The enemy had set up an ambush

142
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:17,950
at the only LZ that would accommodate
one of our birds.

143
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,035
Sorry, Colonel?

144
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:23,456
LZ is a landing zone
that can accommodate a helicopter.

145
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,294
So the enemy,
they block this landing zone,

146
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:30,797
knowing it was the only shot
the team had to get out alive.

147
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,715
All they had to do was wait.

148
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,926
They knew that Frank's team
had to come to them.

149
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:36,052
Fish in a barrel.

150
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,387
So to speak.

151
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,431
Only fish don't know they're gonna die.

152
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:41,891
These men did.

153
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:47,647
Frank went to the LZ all by himself
to draw the bastards away.

154
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,691
Why didn't he order
one of his men to do it?

155
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:50,775
He certainly could have.

156
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:52,777
Not his style.

157
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:58,783
So the men hear the fire fight break out.
All hell breaks loose.

158
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:00,868
Frank against God knows how many.

159
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,120
And then there was silence.

160
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:07,500
The team thinks, "That's it.
Frank's dead, and we're next."

161
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:12,880
Next sound they hear is the helos,
the helicopters.

162
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:15,800
They get to the landing zone,
you know what they see?

163
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:19,387
Frank Castle, standing there, grinning.

164
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:23,099
Thirty-two muj surrounding him, all dead.

165
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:26,644
Son of a gun cleared that entire LZ
all by himself.

166
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,480
How?

167
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:31,483
By being Frank Castle.

168
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:33,485
- And his men survived?
- All of 'em.

169
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:36,446
Including the idiot officer
that got 'em trapped in the first place.

170
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:39,699
If you had to sum up Frank Castle,
how would you do it?

171
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,701
I would say Frank Castle is a man

172
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:45,037
who would gladly give his life
to keep others safe.

173
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:47,248
And the crimes
he's accused of today?

174
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,125
Could the man you knew
have committed them?

175
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,752
Absolutely not.

176
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:55,715
Lieutenant Frank Castle
that I know is a hero.

177
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,634
A man who deserves our respect...

178
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,177
and our gratitude.

179
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,139
Not the same man.

180
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,643
Thank you, sir.
No more questions, Your Honor.

181
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:10,021
People?

182
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:22,241
I'd like to personally thank you
for your service to this country, Colonel.

183
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,744
My father served in Vietnam.

184
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,622
- Do you know what he told me about medals?
- No, ma'am.

185
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:30,708
He said the only people
who truly know what happened

186
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,084
are the ones that were there.

187
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:35,004
You told a nice story, Colonel...

188
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:39,634
but how can we know that it happened
the way you described?

189
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:43,262
Well, perhaps I wasn't clear.
I was there, ma'am.

190
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:47,642
That officer that didn't listen to Frank,
got his men trapped...

191
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,310
you're looking at him.

192
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,895
And believe me when I tell you,

193
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:54,399
I thank God every day
that I only lost my arm.

194
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:58,528
That man saved my life,
the lives of his entire team.

195
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,030
If it was up to me,

196
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,741
he'd have a Medal of Honor
hanging around his neck.

197
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:08,746
No further questions at this time,
Your Honor.

198
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,834
How'd you miss that in his file?

199
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,251
All the names were redacted.

200
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:15,377
Not good.

201
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:16,879
No shit.

202
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:19,549
Hey, Matt couldn't have done it better.

203
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:21,468
It was good.

204
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,310
How is she?

205
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:34,396
Well... she'll live.

206
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:36,858
Yeah? You sure?

207
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:38,610
Sure as I am of anything.

208
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,743
Jesus, didn't we do this already?

209
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,119
Start talking, Stick.

210
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,079
It's about the war.

211
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:51,789
What is?

212
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,165
All of it.

213
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,211
Roxxon, Midland Circle,
the damn hole, Elektra...

214
00:15:57,294 --> 00:16:00,256
All right, you've been using this war
as an excuse since the day I met you,

215
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,842
and you still haven't told me
a goddamn thing about it.

216
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,511
- You know what I think?
- Tell me.

217
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:06,345
I think you're full of shit.

218
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:08,014
I don't think there is any war.

219
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:11,433
I think you're just a sick old fighter
dying to hit people,

220
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:13,398
so you make up stories
to justify your behavior.

221
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:18,065
And then, you rope in the wounded...

222
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,110
so that you can sit back and watch them
throw away their lives,

223
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:22,570
and you can feel important.

224
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:23,821
Sit down.

225
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:28,034
Sit down, Matty.

226
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:36,584
It all began centuries ago.

227
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:38,169
Nobody knows how many,

228
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:40,004
but the shit we're dipping into...

229
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,298
is ancient.

230
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:48,429
Back then, warlords and their gangs
ruled the countryside.

231
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,848
Not that much different from today.

232
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:57,647
Bloodthirsty, greedy brutes after loot,
pussy, booze, same ol', same ol'.

233
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,067
But... one day,

234
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,236
one of these collections of assholes

235
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,115
comes across a thing
they can barely understand.

236
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,367
Real treasure.

237
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:13,120
Not gold, or rubies, or any of that.

238
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,959
They found the secret.

239
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:20,294
What secret?

240
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:21,671
Immortality.

241
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,882
Bringing the dead back to life.

242
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,134
Come on, Stick.

243
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:31,305
I thought
you were a Catholic, Matty.

244
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:36,936
Doesn't your whole belief system
hinge on one guy pulling that off?

245
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:42,024
So...

246
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:46,153
Free from the fear of death,

247
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:51,743
these pieces of shit step up,
kill their master, take over,

248
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:53,911
and paint the shores of the Far East

249
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:56,998
with the blood of anybody
who stands in their way.

250
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,754
They grow in size, power, wealth...

251
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,340
spread across Asia...

252
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:09,010
and finally give themselves a name.

253
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:11,387
<i>Yaminote.</i>

254
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,515
It means, "The Hand."

255
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:18,394
And did they have a goal?

256
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:22,023
Weapons.
It's always weapons.

257
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:24,441
Like, guns, bombs?

258
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:25,693
Worse.

259
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:28,821
Thing called a Black Sky.

260
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,241
So, what's it do, this, uh, Black Sky?

261
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,118
Nobody knows exactly.

262
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:37,579
Why not?

263
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:40,625
Because they've never activated one.

264
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,378
They've tried.
They'll try again.

265
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,173
But...

266
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,385
the Hand made one mistake.

267
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,179
They made enemies.

268
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,430
Bingo.

269
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,475
Some say it was just a kid.

270
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:04,315
Hand comes into his village,
kills everyone...

271
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:06,067
almost.

272
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:12,489
Kid... pulls the knife from the breast
of his dead mother...

273
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:15,242
...and goes to work.

274
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:20,039
He cuts down some of the Hand's
finest warriors.

275
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,586
They're lying dead... kid's standing.

276
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:30,507
They give him a name.
The Chaste.

277
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:33,260
And he's just one kid?
Alone?

278
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:37,223
Kid grows up,
rounds up every warrior he can.

279
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:42,436
Men, women, young, old,
doesn't matter as long as they kick ass.

280
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,938
And they do.

281
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:46,232
Without mercy.

282
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,197
And the only protection this world
has against the Hand.

283
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,159
Wow.

284
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,956
Now, in this fairy tale...

285
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:06,168
you're the Chaste, right? That's...

286
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:07,879
Is that it?

287
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:12,091
It's why I didn't tell you.

288
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:14,886
No, no, it's... It's good.
It leaves you front and center.

289
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,389
Finding the Hand,
keeping the Black Skies at bay.

290
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:20,557
Murdering when it suits you.

291
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:23,519
Believe it or don't.

292
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,775
The fact remains that the city
you're sworn to protect

293
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:32,486
is ground zero in a war
it doesn't even know is happening.

294
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,696
That hole is just the start.

295
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:39,451
So, you can kill, die,

296
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:43,831
or sit on your ass
and watch Hell's Kitchen burn...

297
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:51,005
but this war is bigger than you,
or me, or any of our...

298
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,092
problems.

299
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:58,763
And you've pulled Elektra to your side,
haven't you?

300
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:00,890
Welcome to the world, kid.

301
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,729
Elektra works for me.

302
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:17,198
The bullet penetrated
Mr. Castle's skull

303
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,449
in the lower right quadrant,

304
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:21,452
or more specifically,
the sphenofrontal suture,

305
00:21:21,535 --> 00:21:25,081
which is the cranial suture between
the sphenoid bone and the frontal bones,

306
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:26,415
both here and here.

307
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:30,669
I believe what my expert witness
is trying to convey

308
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,589
is that my client, Frank Castle,
was shot...

309
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:36,758
point blank, execution style, in the head.

310
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:42,764
Could you please describe the damage
Mr. Castle sustained from the bullet?

311
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:44,809
It fragmented on impact,
causing damage

312
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:47,769
in both the right frontal lobe
and temporal lobe of his brain.

313
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:50,231
What are the effects of such an injury?

314
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:53,775
Mr. Castle is suffering from
what we call sympathetic storming.

315
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,362
It's a heightened and ongoing
state of fight or flight,

316
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:59,656
in which the sympathetic nervous system
is hyperactive.

317
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,452
As if he is reliving the incident
of trauma over and over again.

318
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:06,956
It can plunge a seemingly peaceful
individual into...

319
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,125
mental and emotional chaos.

320
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,585
It sure sounds a lot like PTSD.

321
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,212
No, that's not where we're going.

322
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:14,796
Just... listen.

323
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,757
Could you define it for the jury, please?

324
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,093
Extreme emotional disturbance.

325
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,761
It's twofold.

326
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:24,181
First, the defendant is so emotionally
disturbed that he loses control.

327
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:27,434
And second, the defendant
has a reasonable explanation

328
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:29,520
for said disturbance,
from his point of view.

329
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:33,565
Are you aware that Frank Castle's
wife, son, and daughter

330
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,567
were all murdered right in front of him

331
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,736
when he sustained the brain injury
in question?

332
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,196
An injury which, you say,

333
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,909
keeps him in a perpetual state
of mental and emotional chaos?

334
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:43,993
I am, yes.

335
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:47,121
With that in mind, would you say that
Frank Castle's mental state

336
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:51,542
satisfies the definition of
"extreme emotional disturbance"?

337
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,794
Objection, calls for a conclusion.

338
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:56,297
Your Honor,
Dr. Lee is an expert on the brain.

339
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,340
He is qualified to an opinion,

340
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:02,511
and said opinion is not only relevant,
but imperative to the case.

341
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:06,182
Overruled.

342
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:07,391
Dr. Lee?

343
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:10,811
Personally, I do believe
he is suffering from EED, yes.

344
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:14,523
And one who's suffering from
extreme emotional disturbance,

345
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:18,652
is it possible to willfully
premeditate a crime?

346
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:21,488
Any infractions would be considered
crimes of passion.

347
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,325
How many of your other patients

348
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:27,828
witnessed their families being
brutally murdered right in front of them?

349
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,746
Other than Frank Castle?

350
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,082
He's the only one.

351
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:34,668
And so would you say the circumstances
surrounding Frank's mental state

352
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,296
is different than those
of your other patients?

353
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,630
I would.

354
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:43,219
And what exactly would that difference be,
in simple terms?

355
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:45,387
Frank Castle's been through hell.

356
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,431
Thank you.

357
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:48,975
You killed my dad!

358
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,517
I don't give a shit
what you've been through!

359
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,401
- Order! Order in the court!
- You killed him!

360
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:55,064
- I saw him in his coffin...
- Please remove that young man now.

361
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,399
He was my dad,
and now he's gone!

362
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:02,863
I'm now instructing each and every
one of you to disregard that outburst

363
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:06,408
and to not let it influence
your opinions on this case.

364
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:10,162
I did that.

365
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:12,373
Right?

366
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:17,123
That kid, I took his father from him.
I did that.

367
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,545
- Yeah, you did.
- Uh-huh.

368
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,173
Look, Frank, I can't judge you.

369
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:33,351
That was tough in there
for you, right? It was...

370
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:35,066
It was, um, hard?

371
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,277
Yeah.

372
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,695
Okay.

373
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,196
You gotta do something for me.

374
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:48,950
Hmm?

375
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:51,078
I need you to take the stand.

376
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:52,579
Come on, for what?
Why would I...

377
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:56,083
The jury has to know what happened to you,
what you go through every single day.

378
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,669
After this afternoon...

379
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:01,172
I don't think we have any other shot.

380
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,631
What?

381
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:04,675
And what do you think
is gonna happen here?

382
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:05,759
We're not gonna win this thing.

383
00:25:05,842 --> 00:25:07,803
No, but we can still reduce the charges.

384
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:12,558
Look, that might not be important to you,
but it is important to me.

385
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:16,103
All of them,
they all think that you're a monster.

386
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:18,272
But I know that you're not.
You're not!

387
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:22,901
You sure about that?

388
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,655
What if I find these men
that did that to my family?

389
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:27,739
What if...

390
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:32,035
What if nothing changes?

391
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:37,083
What if this is just me now?

392
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,756
Then don't you deserve to know that, too?

393
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:52,639
Foggy!

394
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:53,807
Hey.

395
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:57,936
He'll do it.
He'll take the stand.

396
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,771
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

397
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:02,483
Look, unless you have a better idea,
I think...

398
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,485
How did we even get here?

399
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,320
This guy's a murderer.

400
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:09,281
He's killed fathers and brothers.
You heard that kid.

401
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:10,824
Why are we helping him?

402
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:17,539
Do you think that Frank is completely
and totally mentally healthy?

403
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,000
- I think he's batshit.
- Yeah?

404
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,169
Well, then that's why you help him.

405
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:25,214
Put him on the stand, Foggy.

406
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,882
Shit.
Okay.

407
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:29,551
- One caveat, though.
- Okay.

408
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:31,887
- We get Matt to do the questioning.
- No.

409
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,722
- Yes.
- No.

410
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:36,767
You're doing great, okay?
You're making Reyes play defense.

411
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,851
You... you don't need Matt for this.

412
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:39,728
- I do, Karen!
- Why do you always do this?

413
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:42,481
Why do you put Matt in the driver's seat
when you can do this yourself?

414
00:26:42,564 --> 00:26:44,316
Matt and I are partners for a reason.

415
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,611
There's some things that I'm better at,
and there's things that he's better at.

416
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:49,112
This is something that he'll be better at.

417
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:50,697
He's barely spent two seconds with Frank.

418
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:53,492
I know, but that kid
nearly destroyed us in there.

419
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:56,995
And at this moment, Matt is the right
person to question Frank.

420
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:58,455
He just is.

421
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:02,251
Okay.

422
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,335
I'll get him.

423
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:28,319
- I'm sorry...
- When we met...

424
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,198
was it fate?

425
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:34,866
Was it luck?

426
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,079
Or was I a mission?

427
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:46,878
Mission.

428
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:10,277
Stick trained me a long time,
like he trained you.

429
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,614
He's not a sentimental man,
but he wanted you back.

430
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,786
He wanted you to forget about law,
your friends...

431
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:21,747
your city.

432
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,251
He thought I could distract you.

433
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:28,629
He was right.

434
00:28:28,712 --> 00:28:29,755
No.

435
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:34,134
Because I did the thing
I promised him I'd never do.

436
00:28:35,302 --> 00:28:37,596
I fell in love with you, Matthew.

437
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:41,016
Listen to my heartbeat, if you must.

438
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:42,934
You know it's true.

439
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:49,441
Stick told me about some
secret Japanese organization.

440
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:51,652
The Hand.

441
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:54,696
They won't stop until
they've infiltrated your whole city.

442
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,824
Killed every last member of the Chaste.

443
00:28:57,908 --> 00:28:59,951
- Stick...
- You.

444
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:02,120
We live on the front lines.

445
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:04,456
Like it or not.

446
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,583
It doesn't mean we have to fight
Stick's way.

447
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,545
He kills his enemies,
and we don't have to.

448
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,630
You make that choice
sound so easy.

449
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:14,508
No, it's not easy.
It's impossible.

450
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:19,388
But it's a choice and it's a choice
that I remake every single day.

451
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,015
Every second, sometimes.

452
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,934
And you can, too.

453
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:26,353
Matthew, there are things about me
you don't know.

454
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:27,729
- I don't need to know.
- I want you to.

455
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:30,023
I don't care,
whatever you've done in the past...

456
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:32,693
Elektra, whoever you've chosen to be,
you're free now, all right?

457
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,945
You could have killed those men
at the hole, but you didn't.

458
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:36,280
Because you're not Stick.

459
00:29:36,363 --> 00:29:39,783
And screw him for ever making you
feel like you might be, even for a second.

460
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,242
- He can hear you.
- I don't care.

461
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:43,954
When you were hurt,
when I thought I might lose you, I...

462
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:47,291
I...

463
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:49,335
I felt hollow.

464
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:52,546
Now, I have no reason to trust you.

465
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:55,256
You've lied to me more times
than I can count.

466
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:57,343
But if you leave Stick...

467
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:00,304
be with me.

468
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,640
Fight this war by my side.

469
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:04,933
My way.

470
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:08,395
Our way.

471
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:12,232
Why are you so good?

472
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:17,696
I'm not.

473
00:30:19,323 --> 00:30:20,866
Yes.

474
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:25,329
There's a light inside you.

475
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,502
I tried to snuff it out in college.

476
00:30:33,795 --> 00:30:35,631
I'm so lucky I failed.

477
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,514
Someone... someone's here.

478
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:46,141
You got company.

479
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:48,852
Hey.

480
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:52,731
Karen...

481
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,191
Hi.

482
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,404
Um, let's, uh...

483
00:30:58,487 --> 00:30:59,738
- let's go somewhere.
- No. Why?

484
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:01,407
- So we can talk.
- I don't want to.

485
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,074
I know this looks crazy,
but it's really not.

486
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:04,993
It doesn't...
It doesn't matter.

487
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:08,622
Frank Castle's going to take
the stand tomorrow.

488
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:10,499
And your friend could use your help.

489
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,584
That's all.

490
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:16,422
Nice meetin' ya.

491
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:30,018
Fan club's here.

492
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:33,104
Word must have gotten out
about Frank testifying.

493
00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:35,524
Matt better show.

494
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:39,027
If he doesn't, we'll survive.
Right?

495
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,836
Karen, I'm so sorry about...

496
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,464
Uh, Foggy wants to walk through
some things with you.

497
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,680
Yeah, you wanted me here?

498
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:07,806
Wow.

499
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:09,182
Let's be clear.

500
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:13,562
You're not here because
you're a better lawyer or person.

501
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:17,190
You're here because you're almost as crazy
as Frank Castle, and that's it.

502
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:19,109
So you called me here to insult me?

503
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:21,987
I called you here to be useful,
for a change.

504
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,573
We need to get Frank to tell his story
in a way that keeps him

505
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:26,700
out of prison and alive.

506
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:31,121
No one's heard that story except for you,
because you're who you are.

507
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:33,957
Why don't you put all that torture
you put me and Karen through to good use?

508
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,751
Now would be the time.

509
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,168
Counsel, we about ready?

510
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,879
Uh, one more moment, Your Honor.

511
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,549
Did you read the notes
from Schoonover and Lee?

512
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:43,634
Yeah.

513
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:45,051
Okay, here's the play.

514
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,386
Walk Frank through his story.

515
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,097
Connect the dots between the Colonel
and the neurologist.

516
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,767
We don't have to prove
that Frank's version of events is true.

517
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,310
We just have to convince the jury
that he believes it,

518
00:32:54,394 --> 00:32:55,687
and he relives it every day.

519
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:58,273
We can put this guy in the loony bin,
where he belongs.

520
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:59,775
- Counsel?
- Yeah.

521
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:03,028
Uh, Your Honor, the Defense would like
to call Frank Castle to the stand.

522
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,864
Bailiff, bring in the defendant, please.

523
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,541
Tell me what's going on.

524
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:18,293
Frank's wearing a suit.

525
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:21,505
He looks better than I ever have,
and he's not even wearing a tie.

526
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:30,889
Order.

527
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:39,355
Think about
what you want, Frank.

528
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,032
- Something's not right.
- No turning back now.

529
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:52,661
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

530
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,245
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

531
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:55,789
so help you God?

532
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:57,874
Yeah.

533
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,003
Please state your name
for the record.

534
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:03,547
Frank Castle.

535
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:20,355
Mr. Castle, you've been charged
with multiple capital crimes.

536
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:24,818
Been called a killer incapable
of empathy or remorse.

537
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:26,444
Hmm.

538
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:28,113
Yeah.

539
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,280
So I hear.

540
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:31,324
Frank...

541
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,034
May I call you Frank?

542
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:38,874
Yeah.

543
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:42,460
Frank, we've heard a lot about
neuro-chemistry...

544
00:34:42,543 --> 00:34:44,671
and psychology, and all things unfolding,

545
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:47,257
scientifically and otherwise,
inside your brain.

546
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:50,719
But I just have one question
I want to ask.

547
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:54,723
What happened that day?

548
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,558
The day your family
was so tragically killed.

549
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,612
It's okay, Frank.

550
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,572
- I understand, it's difficult.
- Do you?

551
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:14,743
Do you understand?

552
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:19,039
'Cause I don't think you understand shit.

553
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:29,841
I'd like permission to treat the witness
as hostile, Your Honor?

554
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:30,967
Granted.

555
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:33,094
All right, Frank.

556
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:35,931
You don't want to tell us?
I'll tell you.

557
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:38,474
I'm gonna tell you exactly
what kind of man you are.

558
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,020
You're the kind of man this city needs.

559
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:45,732
Because, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
we all know this city needs help.

560
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,358
Needs it now.

561
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:49,778
Not tomorrow, not next week,
not when the day comes,

562
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:53,073
when the corruption that Wilson Fisk
left in his wake is flushed out for good,

563
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:55,450
and the police force
is finally back on its feet.

564
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,202
We need it now.

565
00:35:57,994 --> 00:35:59,705
'Cause this city's been sick.

566
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:02,999
And the cops, they can't fix it alone,
they need...

567
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:07,087
We all need men and women who are
willing to take the fight themselves.

568
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,255
The kind of people who risk their lives

569
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,842
so that we can walk safe at night
in our own neighborhoods.

570
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:15,595
The ones our esteemed District Attorney
here is trying so hard to destroy.

571
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,764
New York needs these people.

572
00:36:17,848 --> 00:36:20,684
We need... heroes.

573
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,478
Order.

574
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:27,565
The help they offer...

575
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:30,360
...and the hope that they provide.

576
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:35,907
Frank Castle wanted to help,
but he took it too far.

577
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:38,159
He shot people, he killed people.

578
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,535
It's against the law.

579
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:42,622
And he broke that law many, many times.

580
00:36:42,706 --> 00:36:44,582
Now, I don't like him
any more than you do,

581
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:46,877
but here's the thing,
he's not a common criminal.

582
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,045
He's not malicious in intent.

583
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,631
Frank Castle is actually a good man.
He just...

584
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:54,195
He doesn't know the difference
between right and wrong anymore.

585
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:56,011
And he doesn't need punishment for that.

586
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:57,262
He needs help.

587
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:58,638
Our help.

588
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:03,894
That's the kind of man Frank Castle is.

589
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:09,107
And now, you have to decide
what kind of jury you want to be.

590
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:13,194
No further questions, Your Honor.

591
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:16,281
Your, uh...

592
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,366
Your Honor?

593
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,786
Can I say something?

594
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:23,204
You may.

595
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:25,081
You know those, uh...

596
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,376
Those people?

597
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,088
The ones I put down, the people I killed?

598
00:37:33,548 --> 00:37:35,383
I want you to know
that I'd do it all again.

599
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:37,718
This is a circus, all right?

600
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:39,637
It's a charade, it's an act.

601
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,306
- It's bullshit about how crazy I am.
- Language.

602
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,058
I ain't crazy!

603
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:44,684
I'm not crazy.

604
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:45,769
Okay?

605
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,438
I know what I did.

606
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:52,150
I know who I am.

607
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:54,360
And I do not need your help.

608
00:37:57,113 --> 00:38:00,826
I'm smack-dab in the middle
of my right goddamn mind,

609
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:02,493
and any scumbag, any...

610
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:06,747
any lowlife, any maggot piece of shit
that I put down, I did it...

611
00:38:06,832 --> 00:38:08,541
- because I liked it!
- Order!

612
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:11,669
Hell, I loved it! I'm sittin' here, I'm...
I'm just itching.

613
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:14,130
I'm itching to do it again.

614
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:17,425
And you think... What, you think
you're gonna send me to a nuthouse?

615
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:20,470
Some doctor, they're gonna get me to stop
from doing what I want to do?

616
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:22,806
Well, that ain't happening!
Not on my watch!

617
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,184
You people, you call me the Punisher,
ain't that right?

618
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:27,435
The big bad Punisher.

619
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:28,854
- Bailiff.
- Well, here I am!

620
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:30,605
- Remove the witness.
- You want it, you got it!

621
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:33,024
I am the Punisher!
I'm right here!

622
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:35,026
You want it, I'll give it to you.

623
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,905
And anybody who came here today
to hear me whine, to hear me beg?

624
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:41,032
Well, you can kiss my ass!

625
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:43,493
Do you hear me? I'm guilty.

626
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:46,246
Come on, please, Judge!
I'm guilty, you hear me?

627
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:48,331
I'm guilty! I'm guilty!

628
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:51,376
I'll kill every one of 'em!
I'll kill every single one!

629
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:54,754
How the hell did this happen?

630
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:56,131
That wasn't the Frank
I met with yesterday.

631
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:57,590
Guys...

632
00:38:57,673 --> 00:39:00,385
- I think somebody got to him.
- Convincing him of what?

633
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,720
Yelling his way to multiple
life sentences?

634
00:39:02,803 --> 00:39:04,722
- You provoked him.
- What? I didn't...

635
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,805
- What are you talking...
- I had it lined up for you.

636
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,851
We could have done this.

637
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,769
We could have gotten the charges reduced.

638
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,105
All you had to do was get Frank
to tell his story.

639
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,530
- Instead you veer off into vigilante-land!
- Foggy, he wasn't cooperating!

640
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:16,567
I'm glad we lost.

641
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:18,278
You hear me? I'm glad.

642
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:19,820
- Foggy...
- Karen, let him go.

643
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:20,906
I don't want to hear it.

644
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:22,323
Karen, can I talk to you
for five seconds, please?

645
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:24,492
I don't want to hear
another bullshit excuse!

646
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:28,163
Maybe you are an alcoholic.
Maybe you're in a fight club.

647
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:30,540
Maybe you are sleeping
with a whole harem of women.

648
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:32,042
I don't care, I'm done.

649
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:36,712
You're right.

650
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:39,049
This city really needs heroes.

651
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:42,302
But you're not one of them.

652
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:54,730
You gotta feel like shit.

653
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:57,358
Go back to bed.

654
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:01,821
I can barely stand.

655
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:05,033
Then go back to bed.

656
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,540
No.

657
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:19,339
I don't want to be with you anymore.

658
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,300
I want to be with him.

659
00:40:22,842 --> 00:40:25,386
- Don't be stupid.
- He needs more training.

660
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,887
The Hand is new to him...

661
00:40:26,972 --> 00:40:28,723
Soft.

662
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,725
Matt Murdock is soft.

663
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:32,310
He made you soft.

664
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:35,230
You let your guard down.

665
00:40:35,313 --> 00:40:37,983
Go back to bed, Ellie.

666
00:40:38,066 --> 00:40:40,693
- I'm not a child.
- You can't be with him.

667
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:41,861
Why?

668
00:40:44,697 --> 00:40:46,241
You can't change what you are.

669
00:40:46,324 --> 00:40:48,909
Matthew thinks I can.

670
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:51,454
And I believe him.

671
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:57,793
Get out...

672
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:00,463
before I get nasty.

673
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:02,257
Are you threatening me?

674
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,425
You're damn right, I am.

675
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:09,805
Go.

676
00:41:16,062 --> 00:41:18,314
What do you think he'll say...

677
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:21,901
when he finds out...

678
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:23,403
what you are?

679
00:41:25,071 --> 00:41:26,697
What you've always been?

680
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:30,951
Haven't told him yet...

681
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:32,662
have ya?

682
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,500
Get out.

683
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:40,211
Aside from saving your ass...

684
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:47,510
you have no idea
what I've protected you from.

685
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:49,387
I can protect myself.

686
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:56,936
We'll find out.

687
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:19,542
Enough with these amateurs.
Time to get the band back together.

688
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,086
Head to the Wall.

689
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:40,790
Where's Stick?

690
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,253
I made my choice.

691
00:43:46,546 --> 00:43:48,256
He didn't like it.

692
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:53,761
I want to be with you.

693
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,933
The only person in this world
who believes I'm good.

694
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:21,121
You lost today.

695
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:24,542
It doesn't matter.

696
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:29,672
You lost more than just the case.

697
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:34,760
Yeah.

698
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:36,429
I didn't lose you.

699
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:44,061
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:47,022
I'm not.

701
00:44:56,949 --> 00:44:58,659
How does this work?

702
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:01,704
You and me?

703
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:06,917
How can we make it work?

704
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:09,420
I don't know.

705
00:45:11,213 --> 00:45:13,591
But we're gonna figure it out.

706
00:45:17,177 --> 00:45:18,929
Not now, though.

707
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,686
Right now, you need to rest.

708
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:02,259
Who do you work for? Huh?

709
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:04,470
Who sent you?

710
00:48:04,554 --> 00:48:06,722
Answer me! Huh?

711
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,300
You tell them, whoever they are,

712
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:14,188
I'm gonna find them, and when I do,
I'm gonna...

713
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,070
No...

714
00:48:21,153 --> 00:48:23,823
You're... You're just a kid.

715
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:28,410
Elektra, no...
No...

716
00:48:47,722 --> 00:48:49,098
What did you do?

717
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:05,531
This is who I am.

718
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:13,330
Do you still want me?

719
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:20,004
Matthew.

720
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,339
Matthew!

721
00:49:26,802 --> 00:49:28,971
You're okay...
You're okay...

722
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:42,735
I got this one.

723
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:44,028
On whose orders?

724
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,822
The warden's.
You got a problem with that?

725
00:49:46,906 --> 00:49:49,033
No one tells us anything down here.

726
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,599
Hey, look at me, Frank!
Look at me!

727
00:50:13,683 --> 00:50:15,100
I'm gonna stick you!

728
00:50:15,184 --> 00:50:17,477
That's a promise!

729
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:19,229
I promise you!

730
00:51:46,108 --> 00:51:47,234
Right through here.

731
00:52:37,409 --> 00:52:39,411
I see you got my message.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
