1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,156
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,959
So I think I finally
figured out a plan b

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,760
to keep us hidden from Archer
while we try to destroy it.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,991
We'd have to steal it
from Keven Dale's computer

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,231
in his office at Galaxy One.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,456
Something's come up which
requires my immediate attention.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,960
We should get out of here.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,235
Seize them.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,073
- Where is William?
- Mom, what's wrong?

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,560
Frak!

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,976
By the authority
of Galaxy One,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,070
you are under arrest.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,560
Emiko!

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,876
She has
the weapon.

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,536
And we have no idea
where she's gonna use it.

16
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,596
We'll find her.

17
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,558
<i>This is SCPD
aerial support.</i>

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,199
Hold your positions.

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,993
Stop right there!

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,594
We are not the enemy,
lieutenant.

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,319
The enemy is still
out there,

22
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,517
and we should be working together,
not wasting time.

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,831
Six Arrows and six
dead cops say otherwise.

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,320
Talk to
sergeant Bingsley.

25
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,318
He'll tell you we
didn't do this.

26
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,834
Sergeant Bingsley is
unconscious

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,513
in the back of
an ambulance right now.

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,875
Lieutenant.

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,030
<i>Turn around.</i>

30
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,271
Put your hands behind
your head!

31
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,079
All of you, do it now!

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,915
What do you think
is worse,

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,639
Emiko being in possession
of a bioweapon

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,552
or the team being Star
City's most wanted?

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Can I choose both?

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,736
I'm going to go with the
warrants out for our arrest.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,399
The real us, not
the vigilante us,

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,597
which means our lives in
this city are over.

39
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,716
Been there before.

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,576
Guys, this team always finds
a way to come through.

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,816
Yeah, but this
feels different.

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,936
Emiko has a personal vendetta
against you and your whole family.

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
She has a bigger ax to grind
than Adrian Chase or Slade.

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,616
Fine. But there has to be
a way to get through to her.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,976
And she knows
we're alive now.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,176
That'll make her even more
determined to destroy the city.

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,576
Which means we need to
figure out where in the city

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,398
she's planning on
deploying the Cygnus.

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,776
Yeah. Well,
easier said than done,

50
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,616
because Emiko must've found out
that I was tracking the Cygnus

51
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,736
by using its
chemical signature

52
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,592
because she's figured out
a way to block me,

53
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,234
which brings us back
to square one.

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,736
Sounds like
you all could use some help.

55
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,911
It's a good thing you
called for backup.

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,359
In accordance with Star
City penal code 10101971,

57
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,352
you are all under arrest.

58
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,557
Turn around and put your
hands behind your head.

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,432
Ohh. Smoak Tech
flex-restraints.

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,616
Nice to see another
one of my creations

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,438
being used against me.

62
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,716
And what if we don't
want to go quietly?

63
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,156
Failure to comply will result
in summary execution.

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,960
Wrong answer. Hyah!

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,550
- Alena!
- Uh!

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,831
They know what we're gonna do...

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,195
Even before we do it.

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,953
Archer's
predictive algorithm!

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,594
Hyah!

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Hey, troublemaker.

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
I had him.

72
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,870
You're welcome.

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,792
We have to find William.

74
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,872
Not from here.
This place is burned.

75
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,599
I know somewhere
that isn't.

76
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
What are they
gonna do with us?

77
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,877
You mean before they
torture us to find out

78
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,998
what you stole off Keven
Dale's computer or after?

79
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,719
I'm gonna stop asking
questions now.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,280
Look, I'm sorry
I blew your cover.

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,079
It's not your fault.

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,480
Dale's been
suspicious ever since

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
I questioned what
they did to Felicity.

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,879
On the bright side,
I did manage to steal

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,475
Galaxy One's secret evil
plans for Star City.

86
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,472
They plan to use the
ZETAs to establish

87
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,750
martial law

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,435
and remake Star City in The Glades'
image.

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,296
Which means they're gonna hunt
down everyone with a record

90
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,676
no matter how minor
and kill them on the spot.

91
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,073
Which is basically everyone
on that side of the wall.

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,038
It will be
a bloodbath.

93
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,356
Duck.

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,679
Dad, I was so worried.

95
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,830
We're OK, peanut.

96
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,640
We need to get out of here.

97
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,831
You're back just in time
for the fun stuff.

98
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,912
I'm so happy
Roy's back.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,719
I love a good reunion.

100
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,598
You seem awfully
positive

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,114
about the stuff
with your sister.

102
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,160
I know how to break my
family's cycle of violence.

103
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,277
Ooh, I hope it goes
something along the lines of

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,696
stopping Emiko from destroying
the city and killing us all.

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,790
That's part one,

106
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,952
but it needs to be
more than that.

107
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,000
Felicity, i...
I want to help her redeem herself.

108
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,390
If I don't break
this cycle of violence,

109
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,597
I just don't ever see us
being able to provide

110
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,151
a secure future
for our family.

111
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,056
<i>Hey. We just got
some strange chatter</i>

112
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,116
over the SCPD scanner.

113
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
Someone called in
a bomb threat

114
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,079
at a shopping complex
downtown.

115
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,470
Somebody using a signal-bounced
untraceable number.

116
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,630
Suspicious.

117
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,195
Why would Emiko give an advance
warning on her own attack?

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,396
It doesn't make sense.

119
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,234
So that the whole complex will
evacuate into the Plaza outside,

120
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,640
where she'll deploy
the Cygnus.

121
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,359
Maximizing
the casualty count.

122
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,836
Well, we can't
let that happen.

123
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,593
We won't.
Let's move out.

124
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,675
This place
is jammed.

125
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,956
Cops, too.
This could get messy.

126
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,520
That's exactly
what Emiko wants.

127
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,353
Overwatch,
do you have eyes on?

128
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,176
OK. Still no sign of Emiko,
but we are tracking

129
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,793
what is most likely
a detonation signal

130
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,031
to a package on the norTheast
corner of the Plaza.

131
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,280
It's got to be
the Cygnus X-1.

132
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,016
All right. We need to get
these people clear

133
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,474
and find that device now.

134
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,630
Copy that.

135
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,598
We're focused on
the weapon.

136
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,353
Let's get all these
people out of here.

137
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,274
Listen up!
Everybody move now!

138
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,476
We have
to go!

139
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,270
Move. Hey! If we don't
evacuate this building right now,

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,874
all these people
are gonna die.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,030
You're
the vigilantes

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,474
who killed those
transit workers.

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,517
You're under arrest.

144
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,792
All right. Enough.
We don't have time for this.

145
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,314
Stand down.

146
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,995
You should still be in jail...
all of you.

147
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,238
We're not gonna
stand for this...

148
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,915
he's trying to save you,
dumbass.

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,271
Questions later.
How can I help?

150
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,999
Clear a path.

151
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,456
Overwatch, what
happens to the Cygnus

152
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,596
if I shoot it down?

153
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,200
An accelerant will
augment the effects.

154
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,475
You need to freeze them.

155
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,676
It worked!
The Cygnus didn't spread.

156
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,136
You got all of them.
You contained it.

157
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,640
Not fast enough.

158
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,152
<i>Star City is reeling tonight</i>

159
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,471
<i>following a horrific
terrorist attack</i>

160
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,871
<i>perpetrated by its own heroes,
which injured hundreds.</i>

161
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,953
<i>The vigilantes' motives
are still in question.</i>

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,321
I cannot believe they
still think we're behind this

163
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,392
after everything
we've done for this city.

164
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,190
Well, not everyone.
I'm out on parole thanks to you guys.

165
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,856
Look, I know tonight
didn't go as planned.

166
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,936
That's
an understatement.

167
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,553
That doesn't mean
it's over.

168
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,800
You can't possibly think

169
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,513
Emiko could have
a change of heart.

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,875
Oliver's right.

171
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,273
What? I'm happy that you two
are on the same side finally.

172
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,856
But how can you be
siding with the woman

173
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,951
who tried to destroy
your life?

174
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,760
She actually did me a favor.

175
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,514
If I hadn't had toyed around
with being Black Siren again,

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,353
then I never would
have realized

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,016
that that's not the life
that I want to live.

178
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,760
Maybe Emiko will have
the same realization.

179
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,176
If people were correct
in their thinking

180
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,554
that Laurel and I
couldn't change,

181
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,359
well, we wouldn't be
here helping you.

182
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,616
I hope you
guys are right

183
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,633
because Emiko only used
a fraction of the Cygnus.

184
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,633
She has a lot of scary
nightmare bacteria left.

185
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,518
Any idea where she may
be targeting next?

186
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,750
At the moment, everywhere.

187
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,416
The detonation signal's
been purposely scrambled,

188
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,616
which means the target
keeps moving.

189
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,155
Yeah. It's like
a whack-a-Cygnus.

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,596
Ohh,
I missed you.

191
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,313
Our descrambling
algorithm is working,

192
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,756
but it's going to be
slower than normal.

193
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,136
Even if you find
the targets,

194
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,456
we still need to find a way to
contain the drones at each site.

195
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,472
Are you all familiar
with the term

196
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,552
"optimized
cryogenic chambers"?

197
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,835
Oh, no, they aren't.

198
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Yeah. It's just us? OK.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,196
Basically I was able
to modify

200
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,152
an old portable
freezing device

201
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,556
so that it can contain
the Cygnus on the drones.

202
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,976
Good thing you guys didn't toss
all of my old tech equipment

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,559
when you did the new
bunker upgrades,

204
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,856
which, by the way,
are very cool, so...

205
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,473
- Right?
- OK, look...

206
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,520
Uh, it's not that I don't
have faith in this team,

207
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,756
but if this scary bacteria
gets all over the city,

208
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,718
I got to get Zoe
somewhere safe.

209
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,216
OK. Well, Lyla took J.J.
to a secure A.R.G.U.S. location.

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,993
She can pick up Zoe
as well.

211
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,117
You have a son,
right? Connor?

212
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,759
- Yeah.
- We'll bring him as well.

213
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Thank you.

214
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,639
Jackpot. I got two
detonation sites.

215
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,576
OK, digg, Turner, and I will
go to the water treatment plant.

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,796
Roy, Dinah, Laurel,
you go to the convention center.

217
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,056
All right. And I will
stay here with Felicity.

218
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,673
All right. No one die.

219
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,117
- "No"... wow. What?
- Uh, I'm rusty. Sorry.

220
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,078
Well,
I'm glad everyone is safe

221
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,276
to say the least.

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,696
Does anyone need anything?
Do we need any water?

223
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,816
It's very important
to hydrate.

224
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,877
No. And we don't need
any snacks either.

225
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,360
According to
the information

226
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,079
William got on Dale's
computer, the ZETAs

227
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
are marching into
Star City tonight.

228
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,096
We have to disable Archer before
they start their mass execution.

229
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,190
That won't be easy.

230
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
Archer doesn't have
a server room.

231
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,035
Its server is
the actual wall

232
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,839
outside of The Glades.

233
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,037
Wait.
The ZETAs use Archer to track our DNA.

234
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
They'll know
the second

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,256
we get anywhere
close to that wall.

236
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,600
- Mom...
- Hmm?

237
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,776
Why are you making
that face?

238
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,234
I am not
making a face.

239
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,789
This is my face.

240
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,256
I might have put a
backdoor into Archer

241
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
that utilizes
Queen/Smoak DNA

242
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,637
so that you wouldn't
be in the system.

243
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,552
So you basically just
erased me.

244
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
I...

245
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,216
you know, just add that
to the list of lies.

246
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,799
I was
protecting you.

247
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Wait. Hold on.

248
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,633
Yes, what she did may be
overprotective

249
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,313
- and overbearing...
- Yeah.

250
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,520
But it could be the break
that we've been waiting for.

251
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,756
I mean, if Archer
doesn't recognize Mia's DNA,

252
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,416
she could be the key
to shutting it down.

253
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,477
You're right. If Archer
inputs your DNA,

254
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,920
it theoretically
creates an opening

255
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,235
for a virus to be
uploaded.

256
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,696
I mean, I don't know
if it would work.

257
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,536
Well, even if it did,
Archer only inputs data

258
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,153
to its main server
at one location...

259
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,516
the checkpoint between
Star City and The Glades.

260
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,795
That's where Dale plans

261
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,360
to march the ZETAs
into Star City.

262
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,272
So we go there,
we scan Mia's DNA,

263
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,919
we upload the virus.

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,656
Even with the Archer
blindspots put in place,

265
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
we're way too publicly
recognizable

266
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
to get anywhere near
that checkpoint.

267
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,672
I mean,
you can't, but we can.

268
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,592
- No.
- Uh, the... the public

269
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,736
doesn't even know
who we are.

270
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,910
No. It is much
too dangerous.

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,152
Mom, you've trained me
my whole life for this.

272
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,474
Trust me.

273
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,269
Got to hand it to you,
Curtis.

274
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,096
Your containment chamber
worked like a charm.

275
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,960
Nice to know you still
think I'm terrific. Heh!

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,150
Heard it. That was bad.

277
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,197
Any luck unscrambling
the detonation signal?

278
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,136
Dinah started transmission
at the convention center.

279
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,914
Her data plus your data
should do the trick

280
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,957
and help us identify
the targets.

281
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,896
OK, perfect. If we can neutralize
the rest of the Cygnus,

282
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
then we can turn our focus
back to Emiko.

283
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Uh-oh.

284
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
What's happening?

285
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,720
OK, so we have
a good news/ bad news situation

286
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,836
going on here, guys,

287
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,435
the bad news being we
just got 15 new targets.

288
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,552
We don't have time to
neutralize that many.

289
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
We might not have to.

290
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,896
All the Cygnus devices are
linked up to the same detonator.

291
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,376
- That was the good news, right?
- Uh-huh.

292
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,616
OK, well, if we destroy
the detonator,

293
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,016
we can neutralize
the rest of the targets.

294
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,633
I'm working on
a location for you now.

295
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,677
Oh, double frak.

296
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,470
It's at Palmer Tech.

297
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,598
Formerly Queen consolidated,
our father's company.

298
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,673
She wants to tear
down our family's legacy.

299
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,036
This is her target.

300
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,918
Call the team.

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,514
Two of the Cygnus
dispersement sites

302
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,319
have been compromised.

303
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,310
The Circle,
they're concerned.

304
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,270
Look, they want
to detonate

305
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,795
the remaining
devices now.

306
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
That isn't the plan.

307
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,714
The plan was
only to profit

308
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,519
on the destruction
of Star City.

309
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,593
I mean, this extra
chaos is unnecessary,

310
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,195
especially now with
the D.I.A. Closing in.

311
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,558
Chaos is the point.

312
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,109
Without terror,
there is no profit.

313
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,398
The Circle respectfully
disagrees,

314
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,631
and they worry that your
focus on your brother

315
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,313
has led to our exposure.

316
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,120
Your personal vendetta is only
drawing more attention to us.

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,998
I think you...

318
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,878
And the Circle

319
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,997
have forgotten
who their leader is.

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,469
My brother deserves
to suffer

321
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,439
just like I have suffered
all of these years.

322
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,153
And when he sees
his city burn

323
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,357
with his family to blame,

324
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,959
he will.

325
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Overwatch,
we're on-site.

326
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,360
We're in
the telecom suite.

327
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,312
B.C., Laurel, and Wild Dog
are still en route.

328
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,136
I'm picking up over a
hundred heat signatures

329
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,896
in the building, including the penthouse
that is still under construction.

330
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,072
One guess as to where
your sister is.

331
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,256
She really
knows how to maximize

332
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,634
collateral damage,
doesn't she?

333
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,856
If we try to evacuate the civilians,
we'll blow our cover.

334
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,936
We need to find
that relay trigger

335
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,496
before The Ninth Circle
knows we're here.

336
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,352
Actually, just the device
relaying the signal.

337
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,096
There's a power surge coming
from the room you're in,

338
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,600
so the relay must be
somewhere nearby.

339
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,216
We shut down Emiko's
ability to detonate,

340
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,959
we save the city.

341
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,194
Find
the relay device

342
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,397
and then evacuate
the building.

343
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,634
You going after
Emiko?

344
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,870
I've got your back.

345
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,394
Got to go
alone.

346
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,233
Communication is
mission critical.

347
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,277
The last thing we need
are comms failing

348
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,396
while we're out there.

349
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,517
While we're
out there?

350
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,034
Sounds like you still
haven't budged

351
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,839
on Mia and William
taking the reins.

352
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,314
We are about to
stop a small army

353
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,595
from infiltrating
Star City.

354
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,256
I can't be the only one
worried about the kids.

355
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,475
Of course
I'm worried,

356
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,119
but I taught Zoe
everything she knows

357
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,793
about being
a hero.

358
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,439
Almost everything.

359
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,512
And now my little girl's
a grown-ass woman

360
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
and one of
the canaries.

361
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,393
I know she can
handle herself.

362
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,757
And your kids,
they're no slouches either, Felicity.

363
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,433
They're like their parents.

364
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,874
This is not
the life

365
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,394
that Oliver and I
wanted for them.

366
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,600
They're supposed
to be living

367
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,736
happy, normal
lives right now.

368
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,434
That was the only thing
that Oliver asked me to do.

369
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
It was the only
thing that I

370
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,476
promised him
I would do.

371
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
And I failed.

372
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,673
Some mother I
turned out to be.

373
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,796
It's time.

374
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,116
Be safe.
I love you.

375
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,475
I love you, too, dad.

376
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,200
I'm going to be watching
over both of you.

377
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,038
We'll need you.

378
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,555
<i>Mia...</i>

379
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,478
Thought you might
need these.

380
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,511
What happened to us being
public enemy number one?

381
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,776
I told
Pollard the truth

382
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,916
about what really
went down.

383
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,275
You guys are heroes.

384
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
Is the relay down,
overwatch?

385
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,279
Oh, so down,
it's in Australia.

386
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,039
Emiko can't trigger
the devices now.

387
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,156
Every remote device.

388
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,776
There's still an active
one in the building.

389
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,029
Enough to take
this place down?

390
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,315
And then some.

391
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,232
We need to evacuate
this building now.

392
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
You heard
the captain. Move!

393
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,439
Oliver,
the relay's deactivated,

394
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,557
but the building is still
armed. Do you have Emiko?

395
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,679
I do now.

396
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,352
I have been waiting
for you.

397
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,038
Emiko, it's over.

398
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,874
This was his view,
wasn't it?

399
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,519
Your father.

400
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,510
His perch above the
city, above everyone.

401
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,271
I'm glad you'll get to
see it all fall.

402
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,635
Not tonight.

403
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,029
What did you do?

404
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,873
I'm giving you
a second chance...

405
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,552
Before it's too late
for both of us.

406
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,632
I don't need bombs
to kill you.

407
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,477
<i>Welcome to Galaxy One.</i>

408
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,358
Proceed to checkpoint.

409
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,279
This couldn't be
creepier.

410
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,999
Just keep
your heads down.

411
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,336
Once the scan starts,
it'll only take

412
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,840
a few seconds to upload
the virus.

413
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,673
<i>Proceed.</i>

414
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,156
<i>Prepare
for identification.</i>

415
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,910
Done. Let's
get out of here.

416
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,152
Mr. Clayton.
What a surprise.

417
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,357
<i>I thought you'd be
smarter than this.</i>

418
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,591
Turns out you're just
like your father.

419
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,830
Looks like you're having
technical difficulties.

420
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,629
No, no, no.

421
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,416
Don't tell me you actually
liked that creep.

422
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,874
No, it didn't work.

423
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,235
The virus didn't
destroy Archer.

424
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,392
It's rebooting itself.
We failed.

425
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,271
You have every right
to be angry.

426
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,432
I was angry, too,

427
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
because you let
our father die.

428
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,760
And that led to a ripple
effect in my life of loss.

429
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,356
I lost Tommy, my mother,
Laurel, Quentin.

430
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,353
And I wanted to kill you
for all of it.

431
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,272
Hyah! Hyah...

432
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,151
I know his death
affected you, too.

433
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,159
<i>Instead of finding
the hero</i>

434
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,278
<i>that I really believe
is inside of you,</i>

435
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,472
you went down
a dark path.

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,320
And it killed
your mother.

437
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,993
Dante killed my mother.

438
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,436
No, he didn't, Emiko.

439
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,115
Your allegiance to The Ninth
Circle killed your mother.

440
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,238
Your hatred of our father
killed your mother.

441
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,199
His worst impulses
drove you away,

442
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,674
and it led to every terrible
moment in both of our lives.

443
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,116
<i>I think that together,
we can be better.</i>

444
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,280
So if you're gonna
kill me, do it.

445
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,232
Well, if you're
not gonna kill him,

446
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,556
we'll gladly oblige.

447
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,136
Galaxy One must have
found a weak spot

448
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
and modified
the system.

449
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,192
OK. How long until the
ZETAs are back online?

450
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,670
Uh, best-case scenario,
5 minutes?

451
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,680
Dad, you said
the brain of Archer is in the wall,

452
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,353
so if we destroy
the wall?

453
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,510
When we built
the wall,

454
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
we installed
explosives

455
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
inside of each
control tower.

456
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,433
They're linked together
electronically,

457
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,718
but they can only be detonated
from inside one of the towers.

458
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,076
Yeah, but there's no way
anyone can make it up there

459
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,196
in 4 minutes.

460
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,350
An Archer could.

461
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,796
No way, Mia. Look.

462
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,896
Even if you got up there, you wouldn't
be able to make it back down in time.

463
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,990
You'll die.

464
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,200
Once I'm inside the tower,
can you talk me through it?

465
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,136
You know it's the only way.

466
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,675
If you can get inside,
I can access the system remotely.

467
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,912
- Mia, listen to me!
- Sorry, mom. I have to do this.

468
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,996
Beatrice, you don't
have the authority to be here.

469
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,116
The council was promised

470
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,914
the total destruction
of Star City,

471
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,480
not a sibling spat.

472
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,472
And for the first
time in history,

473
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,119
the world knows
of our existence.

474
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,873
The Ninth Circle
answers to me.

475
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,511
Not anymore.

476
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,310
Finish them.

477
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,880
Almost in position.

478
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,275
Ready when you are.

479
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
You're still here.

480
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,680
Yeah. I don't leave
my family.

481
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,592
Detonate the building.

482
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,432
OK. The device is installed.

483
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,696
Now all I have to do is bypass
the encryption protocols,

484
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,757
reconfigure
the detonation commands,

485
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,797
and voila.

486
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Ready when you are.

487
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,839
Take care of mom.

488
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,957
She's already lost so much.

489
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,560
Here goes nothing.

490
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,912
I just started getting
used to having a sister.

491
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,354
I'm not
losing you now.

492
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,397
You have 60 seconds until
that wall goes boom.

493
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Get out of there.

494
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,793
I'm sorry.

495
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,115
I know. It's OK.

496
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,795
You need to hide.

497
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,159
Your family's gonna die.
I made sure of it.

498
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,910
You need to hide
Felicity and the baby.

499
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,435
Emiko.

500
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,831
I... i...

501
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,472
I wanted to be a Queen.

502
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,397
Uh-oh. The ZETAs are
back online.

503
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,677
You think?

504
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,039
<i>You have 20 seconds.</i>

505
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,360
So this is what it feels
like to save a city,

506
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,477
minus Palmer Tech
becoming a crater.

507
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,870
No civilian casualties.
That's a win.

508
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,520
We really couldn't have
done this without your help.

509
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,795
Thank you.

510
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,631
Laurel, thank you.

511
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,393
That
last-minute SCPD assist

512
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,800
really helped
turn the tide.

513
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,752
Oh, well, I'm just
relieved the department's

514
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,416
back on our side
and we can show our faces

515
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,590
- in the city again.
- Yeah.

516
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,832
Because you proved
this is a team of heroes.

517
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,837
I'm sorry about Emiko.

518
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,235
Thank you. I... I know
I tried to save her.

519
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,920
Oliver, I know this
wasn't how you wanted

520
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,071
her story to end.

521
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,835
Hey. I'm sorry.
I hate to save and run.

522
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,434
- Ohh.
- But I have to go back to D.C.

523
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,556
The jeweler called.

524
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,313
The ring I picked out
for Nick is ready.

525
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
You're popping the question?

526
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,456
Yeah. The Holt-anastases are
gonna make it official,

527
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
assuming he says yes.

528
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,136
Of course he'll say yes!
He'd be a fool not to. Oh!

529
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,594
Congratulations.

530
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,736
Any thoughts about what
you're gonna do next?

531
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,816
A man with your
set of skills,

532
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,896
a lot of people
will be looking.

533
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,832
Lyla... well, she's
always looking.

534
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,679
I just want to spend
time with my son,

535
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,274
who I need to get back to.

536
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,079
- Copy that.
- All right.

537
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,395
And then there were six.

538
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,396
Actually, five.
I can't stay.

539
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,358
You're gonna catch
up with Thea?

540
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,750
There's a lot I still
have to figure out.

541
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,832
I killed two
innocent people.

542
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,559
I have to find a way
to atone for that.

543
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,016
Well,
since we're on the subject of good-byes,

544
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,679
we have
an announcement, too.

545
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,910
<i>Hmm?</i>

546
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,150
We're stepping back.

547
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,590
<i>We're leaving Star City.
Not forever,</i>

548
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,239
but, uh, for now.

549
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,595
You just saved
the city.

550
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,120
You don't want to take
a victory lap?

551
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,800
I didn't do anything.

552
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,314
Our team did.

553
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,153
The fact that
the city is safe is

554
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,360
the reason why we can leave.

555
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,318
I've spent a long
time thinking about

556
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,471
my legacy as
the Green Arrow.

557
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,512
I always hoped it would
be saving the city.

558
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,916
But now I know that
my greatest legacy...

559
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,920
Is this team.

560
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,434
<i>I started this
mission alone.</i>

561
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,240
<i>I was certain that
I would end it alone,</i>

562
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,955
but the truth of
the matter is that

563
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,553
every bit of success that
I've had along the way

564
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,518
is because
of all of you.

565
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,816
<i>The city is safe because
of your courage,</i>

566
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,071
<i>your compassion,
your selflessness,</i>

567
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
and your loyalty.

568
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,120
Courage, compassion,
selflessness, loyalty.

569
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Oliver, that sounds like
the 4 pillars of heroism to me.

570
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,096
<i>We should find a way
to remember them</i>

571
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,477
to symbolize we will all be
there for each other always

572
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
no matter what.

573
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,711
<i>Ooh, like
a signal, you know.</i>

574
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,031
One of us is in trouble,
we'll all come running,

575
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,113
including you, Roy.

576
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,351
We should just call it
the mark of four, right?

577
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,560
That's brilliant.

578
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,456
Man, I really hope
this isn't the last time

579
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,834
we're all in this bunker
together.

580
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,434
Hear, hear.

581
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,796
But it does feel like
the end of an era.

582
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,156
<i>OK, well, let's just
try to think of it</i>

583
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,600
as the beginning of a new one.

584
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,315
Star City is a wall-free
zone once again.

585
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,960
Restoring The Glades
won't be easy.

586
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,111
The Glades hasn't been open
to outsiders in years.

587
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,954
Plenty of people will be
trying to take advantage.

588
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,633
Seems like the city's
gonna need heroes.

589
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,995
We were thinking
the same thing.

590
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,976
The four of you are the
heroes that the city needs.

591
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,116
What are you
talking about?

592
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,310
<i>Passing the torch.</i>

593
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Zoe, you are a born leader.

594
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,678
And I think you are
more than ready

595
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,513
to rebuild and take control
of the canaries.

596
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,875
I don't understand.

597
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,720
Someone's gonna get blamed
for what happened.

598
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,035
It should be us.

599
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,315
You'll be
fugitives.

600
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,120
We've spent the last two
decades living in hiding.

601
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,953
Going off-grid
won't be new for us.

602
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,952
Wait. I just got you back.

603
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,872
I'm so sorry,

604
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,714
but the four of you
having a future,

605
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,872
that's worth any sacrifice.

606
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,478
Thank you,
both of you.

607
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,394
I should be thanking you.
You got me off that island.

608
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,520
You never really told me
how you got on that island.

609
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,519
It's a long story. Look,
we should really get going.

610
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,398
Um, I'll catch up
with the two of you.

611
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,656
There's something I have to
do before we say good-bye...

612
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,194
something to honor
your father.

613
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,070
You having second thoughts?

614
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,472
No.

615
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,870
Right. Yeah. Me neither.

616
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,474
It's the right thing to do

617
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
for our family.

618
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,637
I do wish we could tell
the team about the...

619
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Yeah.

620
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,157
Baby, but I
understand it just

621
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,276
puts them in The Ninth
Circle's crosshairs.

622
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,477
When that threat is over.

623
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,112
Until then, it's
the best thing for them...

624
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
And us.

625
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,136
You know, the spirit
of this place

626
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,753
will live on long
after we're gone.

627
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,911
You've inspired so
many people, Oliver.

628
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,432
They will carry
on your legacy.

629
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,432
Sounds like
a cycle for good.

630
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,079
Far better
than that.

631
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,913
A cycle of
heroes...

632
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,478
Who will fight to
defend this city

633
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,438
with every fiber
of their being.

634
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,736
Anyone ever told you you always
know exactly what to say?

635
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,035
I have been told.

636
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,554
Mm.

637
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,230
Let's get you two
to your new home.

638
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,593
Good-bye, old friend.

639
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,313
Well, it's not Ivy town,
but it'll work.

640
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,596
Well,
it's temporary.

641
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,376
Well, basically,
this whole neighborhood is

642
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,996
ex-C.I.A.., ex D.I.A.,
and ex-A.R.G.U.S.

643
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,589
This is one big safe house.
You two will be fine here.

644
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,000
Please thank
Lyla for us.

645
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,230
Of course.

646
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,913
Well, I guess
this is home now.

647
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,536
At least until the threat
against our baby girl

648
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,233
is taken care of.

649
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,276
Your baby girl?
You're having a girl.

650
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,999
Mia.

651
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,914
Mia. That's
beautiful.

652
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,075
It's beautiful.

653
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,672
Well,
I guess since the city's in good hands now,

654
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,992
you two can focus
on your family,

655
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,720
which is exactly
what you should do.

656
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,998
Well, you are part
of that family, John.

657
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,936
Maybe it's the pregnancy
making me overly emotional,

658
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,715
but, oh, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

659
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,640
We love you.

660
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,834
I love you.

661
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,875
And you.

662
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,155
Yeah.

663
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,759
I'll reach out
to you two later.

664
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,997
Hey. You maintain
my bunker.

665
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,480
No food
by the monitors.

666
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,075
There's nothing worse than
crumbs in a keyboard.

667
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,590
What now?

668
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,160
Well, this isn't
a tropical paradise,

669
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,233
but we never did
take our honeymoon.

670
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,317
Oh. Yes.
Mom juice. Mm.

671
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,389
Ahh. You know,

672
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,199
as much as I miss
the team

673
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,998
and the action of taking
down the bad guys,

674
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,313
- this has been so nice.
- Yeah.

675
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,920
I wish William
were here.

676
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,117
Me, too.

677
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,760
You know, if this is
gonna be the new normal,

678
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,390
we should talk
with his grandparents

679
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,834
about getting
shared custody.

680
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,558
Yeah. I would
love that.

681
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,313
Mia's gonna need
her older brother.

682
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Now?

683
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,040
I thought
I had more time.

684
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,830
The universe is a complex
piece of machinery,

685
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,277
and balance must be
maintained.

686
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,273
One change requires another.

687
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,674
How would you propose
I keep the balance?

688
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,549
Will you help me save
Barry and Kara or not?

689
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,678
No. But I will give you
the means to save them.

690
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,353
Tell me what you
need in exchange.

691
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,238
Whatever
the multiverse requires

692
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,518
to survive the crisis
that is looming.

693
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,075
When it is time.

694
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,240
It's OK.

695
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,794
So what bargain
have I made?

696
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,394
What does
the multiverse require?

697
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,233
You assist me
as we seek

698
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,674
to prevent
the inevitable.

699
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,877
But that sounds impossible.

700
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,879
The multiverse is more complex
than you could fathom.

701
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,758
What are you not
telling me?

702
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,519
I've seen your
future, Oliver,

703
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,398
inexorable
and unavoidable.

704
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,039
I have watched you die.

705
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,469
During this crisis?

706
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,919
I am truly sorry.

707
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,558
No. You are not taking him.

708
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,756
Felicity.

709
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,069
Oliver.

710
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,736
I am not here to bring harm
to you or your daughter.

711
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
Trust me, the world
needs her.

712
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,816
You think that I'm just
going to let you leave here

713
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,513
with my husband's life?

714
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,551
This is bigger
than us...

715
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,040
Than all of us.

716
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,918
Why does it always
have to be you?

717
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,236
<i>I cannot
prevent his passing,</i>

718
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,440
but he can prevent
the deaths

719
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,319
of countless more,
including you

720
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,960
and your daughter.

721
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,271
But he needs to come
with me tonight.

722
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,873
Mom?

723
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,236
- Hi.
- Are you OK?

724
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,993
Yeah.

725
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,911
I wanted to say good-bye
to both of you.

726
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,595
- Here?
- Yeah.

727
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,400
I just wanted us to be all
together one last time.

728
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,358
What do you mean,
one last time?

729
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,400
Just because you're
a fugitive,

730
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,875
it doesn't mean we
can't still communicate.

731
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,117
Well, things are gonna
be different this time.

732
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,110
You two don't need
my protection anymore.

733
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,429
You're our mom.

734
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,470
We still want you
in our lives.

735
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,596
I promised your father

736
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,599
that I would protect both of
you until you didn't need me.

737
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,195
He would be so proud...

738
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,314
So proud of you two.

739
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,039
I miss him so much.

740
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,440
I know.

741
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,439
I wish I got to know him.

742
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,398
I know, but he lives on
in the two of you.

743
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,395
It's time for me to go
on a journey of my own.

744
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,995
I love you both so much.

745
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,231
So you promise me...

746
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,395
That the two of you are gonna
take care of each other, OK?

747
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,474
OK?

748

This is why we can't

756
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,430
This is why our children

757
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,593
will never have
normal lives.

758
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,120
I had to make the deal.

759
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,840
Oh, there's always
gonna be some danger

760
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,673
or some threat...

761
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,237
the league of assassins
or hive or The Ninth Circle

762
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,640
or...

763
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,156
The end of the friggin'
universe.

764
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,876
I need you to make me
a promise.

765
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,553
Yeah, OK.

766
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,075
No matter what
happens to me...

767
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,470
no matter what...

768
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,079
you need to do everything
in your power...

769
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,480
You...

770
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,153
You need to keep
William and Mia safe.

771
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,993
I will keep them safe.

772
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,992
But wherever you go...

773
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,435
Whatever happens to you...

774
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,996
You'll never leave me.

775
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,278
On our wedding day,
you told me that I was the best part of you,

776
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,074
but the truth is...

777
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,479
We are the best parts
of each other.

778
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,158
And that is so much bigger
than the friggin' universe.

779
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,114
When I came back
to Star City

780
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,953
to start my mission,

781
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,760
I didn't think that I was
capable or deserving of love.

782
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,316
But you opened up
my heart

783
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,875
in ways that I never th...
thought were possible.

784
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,639
My only regret is not telling
you I loved you sooner.

785
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,040
No regrets.

786
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,794
Would you tell Mia that
I love her every day?

787
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,559
And I know that she
will grow up to be

788
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,109
as smart
and as beautiful

789
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
as her mom.

790
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,354
I will find you... Again.

791
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,476
I promise.

792
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,040
I love you.

793
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,997
I love you so much.
