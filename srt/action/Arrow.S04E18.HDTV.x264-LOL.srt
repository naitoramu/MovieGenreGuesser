1
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:02,822
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:07,224
Kanjigar
septum vohnostrum.

3
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:09,290
Mr. Darhk will be held
without bail

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,326
or possibility of release.

5
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:12,927
You may now call
your organization

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,863
and have that
other message delivered.

7
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:17,999
He said you were
his ace in the hole.

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,968
Is that what you'd
like me to call you...

9
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:24,706
Or do you prefer
Mr. Diggle?

10
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:47,228
Andy.

11
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,631
What are you doing
in the dark, man?

12
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,500
Didn't want to wake
Sara up.

13
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:53,868
Thanks for letting
me know where this was.

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,703
I want you to
feel safe.

15
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,071
You sounded pretty
rattled on the phone.

16
00:00:57,073 --> 00:00:58,306
What the hell's
going on?

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,375
HIVE knows I'm
alive, John.

18
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:01,776
Did they come
after you?

19
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,745
In a way. I mean,
one of them reached out,

20
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:05,680
some guy with perfect teeth
and a missing hand.

21
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:06,748
I didn't--he didn't
tell me his name.

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,183
Malcolm Merlyn.

23
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,551
The head of the League
of Assassins?

24
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:10,885
Well, not anymore.

25
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,120
Yeah. Well, now he
works with Damien Darhk.

26
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,721
Since when?

27
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,089
Two nights ago.

28
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:16,257
Andy, you should have
told me this earlier.

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,393
I know, man,
and I'm sorry,

30
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,694
but this whole thing
has got me thrown, man.

31
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,396
I didn't think HIVE
knew where I was.

32
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:22,864
What did Merlyn want?

33
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,299
I think there's some
kind of friction going on

34
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,700
between HIVE and Darhk.

35
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:27,101
Have you noticed they
haven't even tried

36
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,570
to bust Darhk out
of prison?

37
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:29,904
Yeah, I've been
thinking about that.

38
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:31,339
And now this Merlyn guy
asks me to help him.

39
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,707
Help him what, bust
Darhk out of Iron Heights?

40
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,275
DoD's scheduled to run
Paveway missiles

41
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,511
through Pennytown
tomorrow night at 2300.

42
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,446
Merlyn wants me to help
him hijack the shipment.

43
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,215
Yeah? Well, just one
of those Paveways makes

44
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:42,283
for a pretty good
get out of jail free card.

45
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,053
And that's why I'm
asking you, man.

46
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,455
What do I do?

47
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:49,624
First, kidnapping,
then stealing missiles.

48
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:52,093
Merlyn's trying really hard
to be friends with Darhk.

49
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:55,864
Malcolm's convinced Darhk is
on the winning side.

50
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,532
He's even trying
to protect me

51
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,867
from whatever
he's planning.

52
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,268
The only thing Darhk
should be planning on

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,337
is getting convicted
at trial.

54
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,772
Why does that thing
creep me out the way it does?

55
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:06,407
Because it's creepy.

56
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,276
There's something
that I haven't told you guys.

57
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,445
Shocker.

58
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:11,913
Sorry.

59
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,081
I've seen this
idol before.

60
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,583
What? Where?

61
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:16,584
Lian Yu.

62
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,486
You really love
not talking

63
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:19,888
about that place,
don't you?

64
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,589
Where are we
with the security upgrades?

65
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:22,991
Everything's in place.
We're good to go.

66
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,492
Because Merlyn knows
the bunker's location.

67
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:26,294
If he's working
with Darhk--

68
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:27,762
Then that means we
have to worry about him

69
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:28,963
coming down here
and stealing

70
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:31,065
this creepy
stone thingy.

71
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,734
And what about his plan to hijack
the missile shipment?

72
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,270
Oliver, I think we keep
Andy right where he is.

73
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:36,604
That way, we have
someone on the inside.

74
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,172
Are you sure that's
a good idea?

75
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,641
Well, he's out from under
the influence of Darhk.

76
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:40,808
We can trust him.

77
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,377
Trust is one thing.

78
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,145
Installing him as a double agent,
that's another.

79
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,880
That's a lot of pressure
to put on someone,

80
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,916
especially someone
that is still in recovery.

81
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,119
Oliver, Andy is
a standup guy.

82
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,220
He's got this.

83
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:55,623
And you've got this.

84
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,958
You could
blow that off.

85
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,726
You don't owe
Ruvé Darhk anything.

86
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,929
Tradition. Loser attends the winner's
acceptance speech.

87
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,797
You didn't lose.
You pulled out of the race

88
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,165
because of her husband.

89
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,268
Which I will try
not to mention to the press.

90
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,937
Let's get this
over with.

91
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,742
We worked hard
to get to this moment,

92
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,278
but now the real work begins

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,082
to make this city
great again.

94
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,350
Thank you.

95
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,121
Mr. Queen, have time
to answer a few questions?

96
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,456
I'm not
a candidate anymore.

97
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,824
I'm just here to support
the new mayor.

98
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,459
So no comment
on the write-in results?

99
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,695
Uh, what write-in
results?

100
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:35,229
48% of the electorate
wrote in your brother's name

101
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,664
on their ballots.

102
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,299
That's a historic
showing for a candidate

103
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,968
who pulled out
of the race.

104
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,237
I'll let you and your former
opponent catch up.

105
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,507
Well, thank you for
coming out tonight, Mr. Queen.

106
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:48,376
It's a very
gracious gesture.

107
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,477
I am always gonna
have this city's

108
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,179
best interests
at heart.

109
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,914
Well, let's hope the same can be said
for your friends.

110
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:57,518
Miss Lance, I am
so pleased to meet you.

111
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,921
I was very impressed
by your handling

112
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,589
of the Damien Darhk
hearing.

113
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,224
I was just getting
warmed up.

114
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:05,259
Well, my hope is
that you'll be too busy

115
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:06,728
to handle the trial.

116
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,596
District Attorney Remz
has taken on

117
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:11,566
a new position
as my deputy mayor,

118
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:14,702
and I would like you
to succeed him as D.A.

119
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,404
Think about it.

120
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:18,272
I think that we could
do great things

121
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,608
for this city
if we worked together.

122
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:23,845
Take care.

123
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,086
Listen. Reiter's
men outnumber us.

124
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:33,321
We have guns,
but so do they,

125
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,722
so when we get up there,

126
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:37,458
we cannot hesitate to
kill, do you understand?

127
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,728
Taiana?

128
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,698
Just months ago,
I was a dive instructor.

129
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,634
Couldn't dream
of taking a life.

130
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:49,404
I wouldn't.

131
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,439
This place truly
is Hell.

132
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:54,976
It makes monsters
of us all.

133
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,477
Who's in the photo?

134
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,281
Me and my brother.

135
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,985
I forget sometimes that
we were once this happy

136
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,887
and this innocent.

137
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,689
When I first got here,
I used to look

138
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:10,158
at a photo from my past.

139
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,927
It helped for a time,

140
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,797
reminded me of the person
that I used to be,

141
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,466
but I'm telling you now

142
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:21,969
that that person
wouldn't survive here,

143
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:27,508
and you won't either
if you stay focused on the past.

144
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,178
Do you understand?

145
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,612
Da.

146
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:39,187
How do I take
those bastards out?

147
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,922
Follow me.

148
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,363
It's past 11:30.

149
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,566
It's the U.S. Army, man.
Late means on time.

150
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,967
Or we're staking out
the wrong place.

151
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:54,802
If Andy says this is
where it's gonna be,

152
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,370
this is where
it's gonna be.

153
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,839
No movement yet
on the missiles.

154
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,140
Yeah. We should be
out there with them.

155
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,942
Even with John's
fancy Argus toys,

156
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,746
this place is more secure with us
watching over it.

157
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,483
So are you gonna do it,

158
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:09,984
be district attorney
by day

159
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,786
and Black Canary
by night?

160
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,354
I don't know.

161
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,657
I mean, it would
help having eyes on Mrs. Evil.

162
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,559
Yeah. Well, if you
believe Malcolm,

163
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,129
it will be
a short-term job anyway.

164
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,898
Won't be any need for a D.A.
once the city's destroyed.

165
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,600
You stopped
calling him dad.

166
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,536
Well, that's because
he's not dad.

167
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:32,006
Look. I know I've said
that before,

168
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:35,777
but this time,
it's different.

169
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:38,112
This time, it's mutual.

170
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:41,382
That couldn't be
further from the truth, dear.

171
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,052
Mr. Diggle's
upgraded security

172
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,054
needs a few upgrades
by the way.

173
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:48,289
You know why
we're here.

174
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,590
Hand over the idol,

175
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,692
and there won't be
any trouble.

176
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,694
Well, there's gonna be
trouble then.

177
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,244
All right.
That's the signal.

178
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,286
Guy's dressed like
a League of Assassins.

179
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:19,787
Merlyn probably has
a few loyalists left.

180
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:20,988
Get me in position.

181
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,955
Hyah!

182
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,130
No, no, no, no!
Hold on!

183
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,299
It's me, it's me,
it's me!

184
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,368
Are you always
this quiet?

185
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,536
Come on. We just saved
the shipment,

186
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:09,971
and you made it
look easy.

187
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,875
That's because
it was easy.

188
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,080
Err!

189
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,992
Unh!

190
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,449
The idol.

191
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,918
It's gone.

192
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:00,942

194

You two can
stand down.

195
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,719
He's gone.

196
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,356
- Merlyn?
- Yeah.

197
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:18,859
And a few League
of Assassin members.

198
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,361
He took the idol.
I should have stopped him.

199
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:22,796
We should have
been here.

200
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:25,799
We--I'm sure you
did everything you could.

201
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,200
Merlyn's gonna
give that idol

202
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:29,369
to his new friend
Darhk to get his mojo back.

203
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,371
We've been scouring
the streetcams.

204
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,006
It's like
he just vanished.

205
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:34,408
That's why the League calls
him the Magician.

206
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,076
I'm gonna go hit
the streets.

207
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:40,013
Thea, no one
is gonna give up Merlyn.

208
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:43,216
Well, then I'm gonna
hit people on the streets.

209
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:44,651
I'll check
with Andy,

210
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:46,086
see if he can get
a 20 on Merlyn.

211
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:47,254
Uh, John.

212
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:48,855
Andy has already
risked a lot.

213
00:09:48,857 --> 00:09:51,358
I don't want to put him
in a compromised position.

214
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,593
Oliver, he's already
in a compromised position.

215
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,195
There's a direct
line between him

216
00:09:55,197 --> 00:09:56,630
and the man
we are looking for.

217
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,398
Let's use that.

218
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,866
Yeah.

219
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:05,906
Talk to me.

220
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:08,108
This missile job
was too easy.

221
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,243
It was like Merlyn's
men weren't even trying.

222
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,279
Meanwhile, it pulled
our focus,

223
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,780
Merlyn was able
to come down here

224
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,248
and get exactly
what he wanted.

225
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,683
You think Merlyn
played Andy?

226
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:19,586
What if Andy is
playing us?

227
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:22,856
Look. I'm not saying
it's not possible,

228
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:24,958
but this is John's
brother we're talking about.

229
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,560
I mean, he's done
so much for us.

230
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:27,727
He--he saved Lyla.

231
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:29,563
Should I just trust
him outright?

232
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,965
No, but you better
be sure

233
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,366
before making
an accusation

234
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:35,569
that you and John
can't recover from.

235
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,607
It's my dad.
I have to take this.

236
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,553
Help me! Help me!
Help me!

237
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:54,754
Please. You have to
help me!

238
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:55,956
What is it?
What's going on?

239
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,592
Conklin, or what
remains of him,

240
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:00,327
the thing that
killed those men,

241
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,095
it killed Oliver.

242
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,197
It has Reiter trapped
down there.

243
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,532
Come on!

244
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:40,667
Tea. Hey.

245
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,607
Don't be too
impressed.

246
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,808
That's the only
Chinese I was able

247
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,810
to pick up
from Sara.

248
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:51,978
So listen.
You thought about how you're

249
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,548
gonna tell our
newly elected mayor

250
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,149
that you're turning
down her job offer?

251
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:58,785
I have,

252
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:01,655
but I'm not sure
that I will.

253
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,323
Well, this one's
a no-brainer, sweetie.

254
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:04,624
You can't go work
for a murderer.

255
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,593
This job would put me
in the inner circle.

256
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,461
Yeah, at the cost of being
the Black Canary.

257
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,797
Look. ever since HIVE had
D.A. Bray killed,

258
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,500
the district attorney
has 24/7 protection.

259
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:14,868
They would not let
you out of their sight.

260
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,169
I'll waive it.

261
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:19,339
You think Ruvé Darhk
will let that happen?

262
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:22,642
Listen. I--I never
thought I'd say this,

263
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:26,513
but I am glad that you
are the Black Canary,

264
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,949
I'm glad for all
the good you're doing,

265
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,417
and I'm glad for the good
it's done you,

266
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,254
but you got to know
that taking this job,

267
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:38,758
that means taking off
that mask forever.

268
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:46,166
Careful. Could hurt
yourself with that.

269
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:50,303
It's not myself
I'm planning on hurting with it.

270
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,175
Andy. Yeah?

271
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,476
I got eyes
on Merlyn.

272
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:57,677
Ok. Where are you?

273
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,946
In some old box
factory, I think.

274
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:01,281
You sure
this is the place?

275
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:02,682
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure.

276
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,551
Come on.
Merlyn's this way.

277
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:06,519
Why didn't you have
him radio us in?

278
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,554
I had him stay
behind for backup.

279
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:09,055
Merlyn!

280
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,870
Look out!

281
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:28,775
You ok?

282
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,110
Swell.

283
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,314
What happened?

284
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:35,882
He took an arrow
for me.

285
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:37,284
Let me see,
let me see.

286
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:38,718
Don't worry about it, man.

287
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,719
We deal with this
kind of stuff every week.

288
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:40,920
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no.

289
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:42,389
You got to get
to Iron Heights now.

290
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:43,890
If Merlyn's not
here, then that--

291
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:45,992
that means he's
on his way there with the idol.

292
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,961
If Darhk gets
that idol,

293
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:50,563
no prison will be
able to hold him.

294
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:57,137
Ha ha. Heh heh heh.

295
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,505
One of these days,
you're gonna tell me

296
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:00,473
how you get in
and out of here.

297
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:02,475
A magician never
reveals his secrets.

298
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:03,943
So what next?
You gonna make a coin

299
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,645
appear from behind
my ear?

300
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,113
You know, you're
awfully flippant for a man

301
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:08,348
who's asked
a great deal of me.

302
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,716
Do you have it?

303
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:12,352
Perhaps now's
a good time to remind you

304
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:13,887
of our terms.

305
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,422
Yes. You and your daughter
get spared from Genesis.

306
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:17,090
Is that still
the play?

307
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,125
I don't think you
appreciate what this cost me.

308
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:23,396
Oh, come on.
Stop being so high-handed.

309
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,339
What's wrong?

310
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:34,307
Mr. Merlyn, do you know
what the Khushu idol is?

311
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:37,310
Khushu is an old
Arabic term for humbleness,

312
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,612
suffice it to say, something
I wouldn't associate with you.

313
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:42,315
When the earliest
homo magi forged these idols,

314
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:43,983
they did so
in the image of those

315
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,719
whose powers
they wished to channel,

316
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:48,488
so attention
to detail is essential.

317
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,091
It's missing a piece.

318
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,693
The Ribalvei stone.

319
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,829
They must have hidden it
someplace else.

320
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:58,365
Find it,
or Genesis is not

321
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,834
what you and your daughter
have to fear.

322
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,645
All right.

323
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:13,880
You're gonna need
a few stitches,

324
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:15,848
but, uh, this should
hold for now.

325
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,885
I'm gonna need a whole lot more
than a few stitches.

326
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:21,120
Merlyn's men saw
you fighting for your team.

327
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:23,956
Darhk's now gonna
know that I'm on your side.

328
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,725
I'm a dead man.

329
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,293
I mean, he's just
not gonna stop with me.

330
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:28,761
He's gonna come
for you,

331
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,263
he's gonna come for Lyla, Sara.
Oh, God.

332
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:32,465
Listen. He's not gonna
come for anybody.

333
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:33,499
Ok? He can't.

334
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,768
Merlyn has the idol.

335
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,236
Look. He's probably
delivering it to him right now.

336
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,472
No, Andy.
No, he doesn't.

337
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:41,941
- There's a piece missing.
- What?

338
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:45,211
We separated a piece of it
and put it in another location.

339
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,780
Only thing Merlyn's delivering is
a big, ugly paperweight.

340
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:49,282
Darhk will find it.
He finds everything.

341
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:51,818
Listen, listen.
Andy, listen to me, man.

342
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,053
He won't find
anything.

343
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,555
I hid it myself.

344
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:56,956
John.

345
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,357
Can I speak to you?

346
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:08,935
This information needs
to be compartmentalized.

347
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,703
Listen.
He's scared, man,

348
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,271
and for good reason.

349
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:13,606
He's entitled to
know that we have

350
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,107
the situation
under control.

351
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:17,710
Well, that control is
only as strong as the secret.

352
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,412
The less people
who know, the better.

353
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,614
He risked everything,
everything for us.

354
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,650
He took an arrow
for you.

355
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,552
He has my trust.

356
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:29,789
Why doesn't he
have yours?

357
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,225
Malcolm's gonna try
and get the idol to Darhk

358
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:33,826
if he hasn't done it
already.

359
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,461
I can go there
as A.D.A.

360
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:37,497
and have the entire
cellblock searched.

361
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:38,998
Do it.

362
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,833
Speedy, you
and Spartan go back

363
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,368
to the bunker,
work CCTV,

364
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,036
work facial recognition,

365
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:46,105
do anything
that we can do

366
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:47,240
to get a line on Merlyn.

367
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:48,374
Ok.

368
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:49,542
And what can I do?

369
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:51,711
You should go home
and rest.

370
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,346
You've done enough
for tonight.

371
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,548
What about you?

372
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,284
I'll be right behind you.
I'm just gonna run down a lead.

373
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:27,780
You guys,
get to the surface,

374
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,382
gather the others,
and go for the boats.

375
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,416
Go! Come on!

376
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:31,584
What about you?

377
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,785
Reiter's still
in the catacombs.

378
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:34,020
If he's found
that idol,

379
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:35,621
you won't be able
to stop him.

380
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,992
We don't need
to stop him.

381
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:41,627
We need to trap him.

382
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,733
You guys are doing
a wonderful job in there.

383
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:51,137
You know, I have been meaning
to redecorate the place myself.

384
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,538
You know, my office
received an anonymous tip

385
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,574
that contraband
intended for your use

386
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,609
was smuggled
into this prison.

387
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,377
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

388
00:17:58,379 --> 00:17:59,979
Find anything?

389
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:01,914
All right. Search
every cell on this tier.

390
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,677
I want to make sure none of his
friends are stashing anything for him.

391
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:09,455
You know, you're lucky
I'm not the man

392
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,757
that you think I am,
Miss Lance.

393
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,727
If I were the man that your
father so vehemently claims,

394
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,362
you'd be in a lot of trouble right now,
wouldn't you?

395
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:18,898
Are you threatening an assistant
district attorney?

396
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,333
Oh, no, no, no.
Not at all.

397
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:21,834
Just merely trying to
figure out

398
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,703
where your father
gets these vicious ideas from.

399
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,838
Ooh! Oh.

400
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,608
I hope his mind
isn't starting to go.

401
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,076
You know, dementia
is sometimes

402
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,911
an aftereffect
of long-term alcoholism.

403
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,279
You're a son
of a bitch.

404
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,448
Regardless, it's
comforting to know

405
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,583
that his heart is
in the right place.

406
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:40,052
A father would do
anything to protect his daughter

407
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,288
from the dark.

408
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,693
I'll see you in court.

409
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,007
Looking
for something?

410
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,675
Oh, jeez, man!

411
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:05,144
Do you know
how to knock?

412
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,646
Any luck finding
Merlyn?

413
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:10,216
No, but I think you
already knew that.

414
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:12,151
I'm gonna ask
you again.

415
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:14,387
What are you
looking for?

416
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:17,156
Surveillance.
Ok. Look.

417
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,825
HIVE knows I'm
John's brother.

418
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,360
They could have hidden
bugs here.

419
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,728
Maybe that's how that
one-handed friend of yours

420
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,130
found me
in the first place.

421
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,398
You always have
an answer for everything.

422
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,066
Hey. What are you
talking about?

423
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:29,735
I think that you've
been working with Darhk

424
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,370
since the beginning,

425
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:35,708
that you and Merlyn have been
playing us this entire time,

426
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,112
and now you're here, looking for
the missing piece of the idol!

427
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:42,848
I'm on your side,
remember?

428
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,117
I even got hurt
trying to protect you.

429
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,419
I remember.

430
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,358
I told John
to trust you,

431
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,126
to give you
another chance,

432
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,394
but I was wrong

433
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,763
because men like you
don't change.

434
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,700
Now you tell me

435
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,369
what does Darhk
have planned?

436
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,237
If I'm the man that
you think I am,

437
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:08,708
then you know torture
is not gonna get me to say anything.

438
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,910
I haven't started
torturing you yet.

439
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:12,945
Aah!

440
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:14,380
What the hell
are you doing?

441
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:15,614
Showing you who
he really is!

442
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:16,782
Tell him!

443
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,117
John, he thinks
I'm a traitor!

444
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:23,989
I know exactly what
that Kevlar won't protect.

445
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,324
Let him go.

446
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,427
Unh!

447
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:33,165
Dig, you can't
trust him.

448
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,500
- Get out.
- John--

449
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:35,935
Now.

450
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,056
You had no right!

451
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:47,758
I had every right.

452
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,460
This is
about keeping us safe.

453
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:50,527
No, it's not, Oliver.

454
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:51,729
This is about you
controlling

455
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,364
everything and everyone
around you.

456
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,431
Andy tipped us off
to the missile heist.

457
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,467
We go there,
Merlyn comes here

458
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:57,868
and takes the idol.

459
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,703
Then he brings us
to Merlyn's hideout,

460
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:01,772
where we are met
with an ambush.

461
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:03,140
Where he took
an arrow for you.

462
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,742
That could have
been a feint.

463
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,877
When I confronted him
at your apartment,

464
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,379
he was tearing it
apart.

465
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:09,847
Looking
for surveillance.

466
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:13,117
Or he was looking
for the last piece of the idol.

467
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,552
John, you are the one
who always tells me

468
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,589
do not have a blind spot
when it comes to your family.

469
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:20,891
And you're the one who told me
to give Andy a second chance.

470
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:23,160
You're the one who wanted
to extract him from HIVE.

471
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:24,895
You're the one who
said he could come back

472
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,797
from the darkness
the same way you did.

473
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,966
But I didn't.

474
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,768
I've tried.

475
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,837
I've tried harder at this
than I ever have at anything,

476
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,173
but at the end
of the day,

477
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:39,009
I am who those 5 years
away turned me into,

478
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,211
I'm what they
turned me into.

479
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:44,648
So what, Oliver,
just because Felicity left you,

480
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,283
I'm supposed to
believe that all men

481
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,951
are incapable
of redemption?

482
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:49,253
Not all men are
like you, Oliver.

483
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:53,690
Some of us change,
some of us grow,

484
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,794
some of us evolve.

485
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,529
You are stuck, man,

486
00:21:58,531 --> 00:21:59,630
stuck in your self-pity

487
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:01,098
and your
self-righteousness,

488
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,167
and that is why
Felicity left you.

489
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:11,708
My brother
is my business.

490
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,310
You have no idea
what he's been through,

491
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:16,146
and you sure as hell
had no right to judge him.

492
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:25,355
I'm sure he didn't
mean that, Ollie.

493
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:27,825
Yes, he did.

494
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:29,660
How'd it go
in Iron Heights?

495
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:31,628
Turned up a few
burner cell phones,

496
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,332
6 bags of heroin,
an no idol.

497
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:38,469
Well, we hacked
into the security system

498
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,838
at the prison,
so if anything happens,

499
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,506
we'll see it.

500
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:43,874
Right.

501
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,034
Hey.

502
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:13,704
Are you ok?

503
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,138
John and I had
a difference of opinion.

504
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,373
About Andy?

505
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,075
I confronted Andy,

506
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:19,376
and dig walked in.

507
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:20,611
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

508
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:22,913
Probably should have
taken your advice,

509
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,548
district attorney Lance.

510
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,684
I'm still just
an A.D.A.

511
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:29,086
I'm turning down
the promotion.

512
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:30,854
Because it's being
offered by Ruvé Darhk?

513
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:34,591
No, because taking the job
means giving up my place here

514
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:36,393
with you
and the team.

515
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:40,264
The team's falling apart.

516
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,865
John's furious with me,

517
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:45,502
Thea's consumed
with a rage for Malcolm,

518
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:48,338
and...

519
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,042
Well, Felicity's gone.

520
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:53,644
Becoming district attorney's
something that you've worked

521
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:55,712
the better part
of 3 years for.

522
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:56,914
I might have wanted
to be D.A.,

523
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,582
but that was
a lifetime ago.

524
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,450
Sara's lifetime?

525
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:05,055
You channeled your grief
and became the Black Canary,

526
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:07,257
but Sara's not dead
anymore.

527
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:08,559
Maybe you owe it
to yourself

528
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:10,494
to pursue the path
you were on.

529
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,762
You're serious?

530
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:13,463
This city has enough
heroes with masks on.

531
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:15,432
With Ruvé Darhk
as mayor,

532
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:19,469
it needs a hero
without a mask.

533
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,371
It needs Laurel Lance.

534
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:29,746
Rec time.
20 minutes. 20 minutes.

535
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:33,283
Ahh. Uh, are you
in touch with the land,

536
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,085
spend much time
in mother nature?

537
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:37,588
No? Well, your
ancestors did.

538
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,091
They knew that life
is a series of phases.

539
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,827
"A time to be born,
a time to die,

540
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,663
"a time to plant,
a time to uproot,

541
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:49,099
a time to kill."

542
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:52,302
Master the paradox
of change with inconstancy,

543
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:54,972
and the primordial force
of nature itself

544
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:56,840
will be at your
beck and call.

545
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:04,848
Ah. My idol--
Julius Caesar.

546
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,519
"Cry havoc! And let slip
the Dogs of War."

547
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:31,408
What happened?

548
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,743
It was rec hour.

549
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:34,177
The prisoners were out
of their cells.

550
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,679
He's holding
the guards hostage.

551
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:37,247
- How many?
- Doesn't matter how many.

552
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,882
We have to put Darhk
back in his cage.

553
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:40,250
Let's gear up!

554
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,486
Oliver, I can't
prosecute him

555
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:44,154
without getting him
into custody first.

556
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,958
One last time.

557
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,500
What the hell's going on
around here?

558
00:26:04,502 --> 00:26:06,402
Can't just stand around here
waiting for something to happen.

559
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:07,803
Who's in charge?

560
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:09,038
Not you, captain.
You've been suspended.

561
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,073
Heh heh heh.
Pike, right?

562
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:12,241
Well, that figures.

563
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:13,576
Wait it out till we've
got a stack

564
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:15,344
of dead bodies
on our hands.

565
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:17,046
I'm sorry, sir. You need to get back
to your vehicle.

566
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:18,180
No. I want to
speak with him.

567
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:20,683
I need to speak
with him now!

568
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:22,318
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can do that.

569
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,220
You can do that.
Go get--never mind.

570
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:25,921
- I see him.
- Sir!

571
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:27,857
Pike! Hey! I see
you overhere!

572
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:29,859
How are we gonna
get through all those cops?

573
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:32,161
Looks like Lance
has it covered.

574
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:35,431
By laying into
Lieutenant Pike apparently.

575
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:36,866
And he just knocked
him out.

576
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:39,268
As a distraction
to give us an opening.

577
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,569
Let's move.

578
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:47,343
Thought
I told you to come alone.

579
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:49,178
You did,
and I didn't.

580
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,780
Look. I know
you don't trust me,

581
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:53,582
but that's why I'm here--
to prove you can.

582
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:55,384
Darhk has hostages
in the mess hall.

583
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,553
Let's fan out and hit them
from all sides.

584
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,596
I remember this guy.

585
00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:08,831
Those lips.

586
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,299
Gross.

587
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:32,421
Not a bad warmup.

588
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:34,190
It seems like you're
ready for a rematch.

589
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,791
Go get the others.

590
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:36,892
I've got this.

591
00:27:36,894 --> 00:27:39,895
- No. Let me take him.
- Go!

592
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:41,630
Let's see how well
I taught you.

593
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:47,603
Huh.

594
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:49,104
You know, the police
took me seriously

595
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:50,606
when I said I would start
killing hostages

596
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:52,675
if they moved
upon the prison.

597
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:54,210
It's too bad our
masked vigilante friends

598
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:55,811
didn't get the memo.

599
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,647
Well, too bad
for you really.

600
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,115
Kill them.

601
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,499
Unh!

602
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,936
You no longer have
the drive to kill, and it shows.

603
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:57,306
You lost part of yourself
when they cured you of that bloodlust,

604
00:28:57,308 --> 00:29:00,876
and that is why
you will never beat me.

605
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,899
Andrew Diggle,
it's been a while.

606
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:25,301
Let him go!

607
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:26,402
Drop your weapons.

608
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:27,670
Don't do it.

609
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:29,438
Suit yourself,
but on the count of 3,

610
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,906
I'm gonna turn
that wall into

611
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:32,207
a Jackson Pollock
painting with his brains.

612
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:34,109
1...

613
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:35,544
2...

614
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:39,548
Ok.

615
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:45,354
Now was that
so hard?

616
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:52,828
I believe you have
something for me.

617
00:29:57,668 --> 00:29:59,835
An--Andy.

618
00:29:59,837 --> 00:30:01,770
I'm sorry, man.

619
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:04,974
Heh heh heh.

620
00:30:04,976 --> 00:30:07,776
Andy.

621
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:09,311
I've been tracking
your movements for months.

622
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:11,146
I know everywhere
you been.

623
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:14,116
All I needed to hear
was that it was you

624
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:15,651
that hid the stone.

625
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:17,353
Was there ever
a chance for you?

626
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:19,955
Your brother's way beyond
reach, Mr. Diggle.

627
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:25,461
It's all over now.

628
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:28,397
Unh!

629
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,265
Took the words right
out of my mouth!

630
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:46,482
I need to sacrifice.

631
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:53,188
Not enough.
You know what to do.

632
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:57,626
Ohh.

633
00:30:57,628 --> 00:31:00,696
Kanjigar septum
vohnostrum.

634
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:07,169
Ha ha ha!

635
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:12,608
Ohh! Oh, I feel
so much better.

636
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,809
Hey. I am sorry
about your buddies,

637
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:15,778
but omelets and eggs
and all of that,

638
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,079
but I know how to make it
up to you, though.

639
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:20,015
Who wants to go
for a walk outside?

640
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:22,051
Heh heh heh.

641
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:24,019
Andy here
might have mentioned

642
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:26,455
that his brother John
worked for the Green Arrow,

643
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:29,625
or should I say
Oliver Queen?

644
00:31:29,627 --> 00:31:31,026
Oh, oh, oh, see, I know
what you're all thinking,

645
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:32,394
but, no, he didn't
tell me.

646
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:34,029
It was really just
a hop, skip, and a jump

647
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,497
from the whole
Diggle connection

648
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:38,834
to you to your little sister
to your ex-girlfriend,

649
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:41,136
but when you came
to rescue that boy William,

650
00:31:41,138 --> 00:31:44,673
that look on your face,
that was a father's look.

651
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:46,341
I should have recognized
it there and then.

652
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,943
We need to
get out of here now.

653
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:49,344
Patience.

654
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:54,783
I've been waiting
for this moment for a long time.

655
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:58,720
Ms. Lance,
9 months ago,

656
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:01,223
I made your daddy
a promise.

657
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:03,559
I told him what I would do
if he betrayed me.

658
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:04,760
Unh!

659
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,797
Impressive.

660
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,365
Now where was I?

661
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:14,336
Oh, yeah. I want
you to give your father a message

662
00:32:14,338 --> 00:32:15,737
from me.

663
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:17,940
I want you to tell
him--unh!

664
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:22,878
I'm a man of my word.

665
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:30,319
Ohh.

666
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:35,124
Hey, hey.
It's all right. It's ok.

667
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:37,126
Hey, hey. Look at me.
You're gonna be all right.

668
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:38,488
You're gonna be all right.
Come on.

669
00:32:45,637 --> 00:32:48,471
Help!
Help in here, please!

670
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,475
You have to help
her, please!

671
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:54,210
She's lost a lot
of blood.

672
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:56,646
I need a crash cart
and a trauma team in here stat!

673
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:58,147
- Let her go.
- What?

674
00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:01,317
I need you to let her go
so I can do my job.

675
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,718
Now leave!

676
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,353
The trauma team
will be in here any second,

677
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:06,856
and the last thing
she needs right now is a circus.

678
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:09,458
Go! Go.

679
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:15,164
How do you know
how to do this,

680
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:18,200
to bury a man alive?

681
00:33:18,202 --> 00:33:22,238
You were right
how this island changed you.

682
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,273
Do you still look
at your picture?

683
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:34,884
She's beautiful.

684
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:36,786
Who is she?

685
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:39,722
Her name is Laurel Lance,

686
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:47,329
and she was my home
before a this.

687
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,631
I don't know what
she'll think

688
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:49,965
of the man
I've become.

689
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,334
If I don't make it
off this island,

690
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:53,936
you will go to Russia
and find my parents

691
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:56,639
and tell them what
happened to me and Vlad.

692
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,708
If you don't make it,

693
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,810
I will find this Laurel
and tell her

694
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:03,379
how you saved us all.

695
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:04,814
Deal?

696
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:09,151
Deal.

697
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:13,355
Baron, we've got to
get out of here.

698
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:19,328
There is
no getting out,

699
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,065
but with your deaths,
I might yet just live.

700
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,834
What are you
talking about?

701
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:38,547
Kanjigar septum
vohnostrum.

702
00:34:44,355 --> 00:34:46,122
Today's prison riot
at Iron Heights

703
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:48,758
has left the city on edge.

704
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,092
Hey, Lopez, Lopez.

705
00:34:50,094 --> 00:34:51,994
What happened
at the, uh--at the prison?

706
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:54,029
Uh, you punched out
a lieutenant.

707
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:55,765
Yeah. I mean,
after that.

708
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,399
Did they keep those
inmates from escaping?

709
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:58,534
Too many of them,

710
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:01,704
and one--Darhk--
he hurt one of them.

711
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:02,872
What? What?
Who--who'd he hurt?

712
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:05,007
The vigilantes.
The Black Canary.

713
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:08,811
Supposedly, he hurt
her real bad.

714
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:12,882
I--um, listen. Uh, I got
to get out of here, all right?

715
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:14,450
It's--it's
real important,

716
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:16,619
so please get me, uh--
see if you can get

717
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:18,587
Lieutenant Pike
on the phone.

718
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:19,855
He's out supervising
the manhunt

719
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:21,290
for the escaped
prisoners.

720
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:22,691
You got to get him
on the phone, all right,

721
00:35:22,693 --> 00:35:24,193
because I got to
talk to him,

722
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:25,728
because I got to get
out of here just for an hour.

723
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,896
I'm gonna surrender
myself back in, all right?

724
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:29,465
That's fine,
but just--just

725
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:32,301
get Lieutenant Pike
on the phone, please.

726
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:39,008
Hi.

727
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:45,281
Laurel--is she--

728
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:46,849
Laurel's in surgery.

729
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,918
Um...

730
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,086
I don't know.

731
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:53,422
I've tried calling
Lance, too, so...

732
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,159
What happened
with Darhk?

733
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,894
He's in the wind

734
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:02,932
along with 50 or so
inmates.

735
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:04,466
And Andy.

736
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:13,175
You warned me,
and I didn't listen.

737
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,947
I'll never be able
to forgive myself.

738
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:24,153
Oh, my God.

739
00:36:29,994 --> 00:36:31,861
Just out of recovery.

740
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:33,262
She's gonna be fine.

741
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,566
She's a strong woman,
your friend.

742
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:38,968
The strongest.

743
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,870
She's been asking
for you.

744
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:56,418
Hi.

745
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,554
Hey yourself.

746
00:36:58,556 --> 00:36:59,822
Did Darhk--

747
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:01,223
Don't worry
about him.

748
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:02,958
Just worry about
getting better, ok?

749
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,195
It's not exactly how
I wanted my last night to go.

750
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:07,363
What are you
talking about?

751
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:10,466
It's a long story.

752
00:37:10,468 --> 00:37:12,234
I was gonna give up
being the Black Canary,

753
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:17,172
but I realized I didn't
know how I could

754
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:23,479
because going out there
and fighting alongside you guys,

755
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:26,715
it's what makes me
feel alive inside...

756
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:31,086
And I love you guys
so much.

757
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:32,588
We love you.

758
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,124
We love you.

759
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:36,425
We love you.

760
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:43,666
We should probably let you
get some rest.

761
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:45,701
We'll be right
outside, ok?

762
00:37:45,703 --> 00:37:47,069
Ok.

763
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:57,579
You should probably
get some rest, too.

764
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:59,782
No chance.

765
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:02,051
I'm gonna stay
right here.

766
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:04,186
There's...

767
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,422
Something in my
left pouch.

768
00:38:06,424 --> 00:38:08,590
Will you bring it
to me?

769
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:09,959
Yeah.

770
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:15,842
May I?

771
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,373
Yeah.

772
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:29,511
You kept this?

773
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,080
Yeah.

774
00:38:35,286 --> 00:38:36,885
Just a little reminder

775
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:41,590
of when things
were simpler

776
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:44,927
for us,

777
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:47,830
the way we used
to be.

778
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:52,267
I'm really glad that
you found Felicity,

779
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:57,873
and I hope you find
your way back to her,

780
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:01,944
and, Ollie, I know that
I am not the love of your life...

781
00:39:03,848 --> 00:39:07,016
But you will always be
the love of mine.

782
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:12,154
Why are you
telling me this?

783
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:14,189
Why now?

784
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:17,326
Because tonight it was
just a reminder that...

785
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:22,498
Anything can happen,

786
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,834
which why I need you
to promise me something.

787
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:35,944
I just got off the phone
with Captain Lance.

788
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:40,149
He's on his way.
I--I told him that she's doing fine.

789
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:41,784
Out of the way!

790
00:39:46,357 --> 00:39:49,158
Embolism. I need 5,000 units
of heparin bolus!

791
00:39:51,062 --> 00:39:52,361
What happened?

792
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:53,562
Uh, I--I don't know.
She was fine.

793
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:56,598
Paddles!

794
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,200
Charging.

795
00:39:58,202 --> 00:40:00,069
