1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,831
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,253
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,798
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,175
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,803
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,755
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,053
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,267
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,724
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,263
Hi, Ollie.

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,183
SCPD!

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,899
<i>His name is Vincent Sobel.</i>

13
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,404
He's my old partner.

14
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,611
We have to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

15
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,943
The police are coming. You should go.

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,529
Will you marry me?

17
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,988
Yeah.

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,824
You're the very best part of me.

19
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,078
I'm a better human being
just because I've loved you.

20
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,413
No matter what life throws at us,
our love can conquer it.

21
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,291
<i>Oliver Jonas Queen,
Felicity Megan Smoak,</i>

22
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,545
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,678
Please, kiss your bride.

24
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,759
There he is. Hey, buddy.

25
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,678
Aunt Thea said
I could have some champagne.

26
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,513
I said a sip,

27
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,564
and only during the toast.

28
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,189
Mom and Dad used to let us do that.
That's just fine.

29
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,023
Yeah, and we turned out all right.

30
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,240
I think that they would be
pretty impressed with this party,

31
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,657
and the groom.

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,072
- Think so?
- Yeah. Of course.

33
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,446
Why, is everything okay?

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,907
Felicity was supposed to be here
by now, so...

35
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,334
What's there
to be nervous about, Ollie?

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,912
You guys are already married,

37
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,086
and it's not like you invited
anyone but John to the ceremony.

38
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,632
Well, uh,
you were still in the hospital,

39
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,335
and it was
just a little last minute, okay?

40
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,045
- Yeah, I know. I know.
<i>- Hey, you.</i>

41
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,546
Hey.

42
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,761
Lyla apologizes
for not being able to make it.

43
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,308
A.R.G.U.S. missions
do not stop for weddings.

44
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,637
Well, she was hoping that
it would for this.

45
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,221
Congrats, man.

46
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,437
- So where is the bride?
- I don't know.

47
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,693
Donna said that
she had a plan, but...

48
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,511
Mom insisted
that we make an entrance

49
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,758
since we didn't have
a traditional wedding,

50
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,134
which I'm sure
I'll never stop hearing about

51
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,340
for the rest of my life.

52
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,300
- Welcome to the family...
- Oh.

53
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,181
Son.

54
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,851
- I can call you that now, right?
- Sure.

55
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,273
- Yeah.
- Great.

56
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,683
I want you to know

57
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,653
that I have forgiven both of you
for running off

58
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,021
and eloping.

59
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,653
And for waiting to
propose to my daughter

60
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,029
until you were under indictment.

61
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,985
Oh, actually, Felicity proposed to me.

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,616
Come on, Donna,
let's let them have their day.

63
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,447
They did have their day,
and we weren't part of it, remember?

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,367
I guess she's keeping
the tradition of the Smoak women

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,536
not having traditional weddings.

66
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,292
What are you talking about?
We had a wedding.

67
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,045
No. Getting married by
a Tom Jones-impersonating rabbi

68
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,124
isn't exactly traditional.

69
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,086
- You love Tom Jones.
- No, I don't. You love Tom Jones.

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,921
You know what?
At least we had a Jewish wedding.

71
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,598
Seriously, you guys, would it
have killed you to get a rabbi?

72
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:05,925
Or a chuppa?

73
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,181
I'm gonna steal Felicity
for a moment.

74
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,103
- Oh, yes, of course.
- I'll bring her back.

75
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,807
Those whack jobs
are already your in-laws.

76
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,813
So, if you're having second thoughts,
it's too late for you.

77
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,485
I wouldn't have it any other way.

78
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,564
You really do love me.

79
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,760
I always knew you guys
would end up together.

80
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,432
- Didn't I say that, honey?
- She did.

81
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,931
Even when I saw on the news
that your engagement was off,

82
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,761
I kept telling this one, "Adam,

83
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,689
"Felicity and Oliver
are meant to be together,

84
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,767
"they're going to work it out."
Didn't I say that, honey?

85
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:56,851
- You did.
- I did.

86
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,311
Well, we're so glad
you guys could make it.

87
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,486
It's great to see you again.

88
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,443
<i>Well, I'd tell you guys
to move back to Ivy Town,</i>

89
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,367
but I guess being mayor of Star City
would make that kinda tough, right?

90
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,947
We love Ivy town, but...

91
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,737
Star City is our home.

92
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,536
Best part about weddings,

93
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,167
free booze. <i>Salud.</i>

94
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,120
Mmm!

95
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,710
Paul and I had, um,

96
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,042
specialty cocktails
made at our wedding.

97
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,096
Hopetini and Peach Paul Sangria.

98
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,757
We also wore matching white tuxes.

99
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,104
Can I have
a glass of champagne, please?

100
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,769
You okay?

101
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,067
Me? Oh, yeah, of course.

102
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,395
Just because I'm divorced
doesn't mean that I can't

103
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,321
handle celebrating
people getting married.

104
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,777
Well, I'm not
that into weddings, either.

105
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,940
Shocker.

106
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,947
Well, the idea of
spending the rest of your life

107
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,494
with one person seems

108
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,448
pretty unrealistic, and, uh,
also pretty boring.

109
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,659
It's probably why I've had
so many busted engagements.

110
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,951
- Say what?
- What?

111
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,497
I'll be right back.

112
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,127
But you're just gonna leave
on that bombshell,

113
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,709
- that's what you're gonna do?
- Mmm.

114
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,091
Is it me or has she been
acting weird lately?

115
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,013
Oh, no, she's definitely
been on upswipes.

116
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,466
She's been secretly
texting with somebody for weeks now.

117
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,301
Good for her.

118
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,679
You know, maybe you should
start dating, too.

119
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,390
Oh... Yeah.

120
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,017
- I date plenty.
- Oh, really, who?

121
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,978
Mmm-hmm. "Who?" Oh, man, you know,

122
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,313
- so many guys.
- Wow.

123
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,363
There's one guy in particular
who I'm dating... Uh...

124
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,366
His name is Dom Pérignon.

125
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,576
He is smooth, and expensive,
and he's really nice.

126
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,827
Uh, but there's like other guys, too.

127
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:34,907
I'm not trying to be
tied down right now.

128
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,991
You know, I'm trying to live
my best single life.

129
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,419
Yeah. Who, like Tom Collins, Rob Roy?

130
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,121
I'm not actually a gin guy.

131
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,834
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

132
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,464
Come on, Quentin,
it's "Oliver" tonight.

133
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,087
Matter of fact, it's always "Oliver."

134
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,258
Well, I got a little something
for you, Oliver.

135
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,063
Yeah, I know,
it doesn't look like much.

136
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,693
But, uh, my dad gave that to me
on my wedding day.

137
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,403
Quentin, I can't accept this.

138
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,606
It's not like I got anybody
I can give it to, is it?

139
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,451
And besides, it's not right
you don't have a parent here tonight.

140
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,826
Thank you.

141
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,241
This means a lot.

142
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,827
Thank you.

143
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,106
Right here, right here,
right here. Here we go.

144
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,152
- I got it, I got it, I got it!
- Yes!

145
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,407
Love...

146
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,323
What is love, really?

147
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,708
<i>It is not tangible.</i>

148
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,457
So, who's to say
it's not just made up?

149
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:07,049
I mean, there's no hardcore proof
that it actually exists.

150
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,841
I mean, look,
I love a lot of things.

151
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,507
Sweaters, math, coffee,
but, you know,

152
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,513
I'm not gonna marry that stuff.

153
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,471
<i>What is marriage anyway?
Like, what is it? Like, is it...</i>

154
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,933
As a paper, it says,
"Oh! I won't leave you ever."

155
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,600
No, I could leave, like that.

156
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,402
So, what is marriage, really,
what it boils down to, I...

157
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,781
And everybody give Curtis
a round of applause.

158
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,819
Thank you, Curtis. Thank you.

159
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,494
<i>Um, I think what my friend
is trying to say is,</i>

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,990
true love is...

161
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,669
So special
that we all dream about it.

162
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,917
<i>And when I look at
Oliver and Felicity,</i>

163
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,997
<i>I'm reminded of</i>

164
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,880
how I felt about my wife
on our wedding day.

165
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,762
We were so in love.

166
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,715
And we would do
anything for each other,

167
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,970
I mean, no matter what.

168
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,182
And that is the epitome of
Oliver and Felicity.

169
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,935
<i>Yeah, I mean, you guys
have had your struggles,</i>

170
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,475
<i>but you always work through it.</i>

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,309
These are

172
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,862
two of the most genuine people
in the world,

173
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,691
<i>and they deserve
all the happiness,</i>

174
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,076
and I'm so fortunate
to call them my friends.

175
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,952
So, please raise a glass
to true love.

176
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,200
Oliver and Felicity.

177
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,211
To Oliver and Felicity.

178
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,881
<i>It's time now
for the couple's first dance.</i>

179
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,611
This is only a courtesy dance
because your speech was so sweet.

180
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,942
I have my moments.

181
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,860
You okay?

182
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,154
Yeah. You know, just, um...

183
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,291
Thought a friend might've come,
would've been nice to see him.

184
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,584
Oh, it's a "him"?

185
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,212
I'm guessing he's more than
just a friend then.

186
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,541
Weddings make you nostalgic
for the ones you love.

187
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,926
I definitely miss my wife
and my family.

188
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,297
You know, for what it's worth,
I did see the DJ checkin' you out.

189
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,804
No, no, no. I don't do DJs.

190
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,307
I had this thing once,
it did not work out.

191
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,519
Can you believe
our daughter is married?

192
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,942
- Oh, my God.
- I really can't.

193
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,316
Thanks for letting me back
in her life.

194
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,816
I made a mistake
asking you to stay away.

195
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,486
Seriously, Felicity needs her father
in her life.

196
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,696
And just for the record,

197
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,658
I think Tom Jones is actually...

198
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,790
He's pretty good.

199
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,246
- I kinda like him.
- Hey.

200
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,960
- Hey.
- I'm sorry, this is awkward.

201
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,418
- You two know each other?
- No, it's, um...

202
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,044
We...

203
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,092
Well, then this is awkward.
I'll go get myself a drink.

204
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,729
Wow, you look, um...

205
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,225
You look...

206
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,777
- Really good.
- You mean I look sober.

207
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,853
Yeah.

208
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,523
I'm sorry, the last time I saw you...

209
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,358
You were going through a nightmare.

210
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,371
Ah, it's Jean Loring.
This is Oliver's lawyer.

211
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,669
I gotta take this. I'm sorry.

212
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,212
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

213
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,041
I was never the girl who dreamed
about her wedding,

214
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,799
but I have to say
this was the perfect evening.

215
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,174
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

216
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,553
Uh... I'm so sorry. We got a problem.

217
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,976
I think I jinxed it.

218
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,769
Come on.

219
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,894
- What's going on?
- Well, listen,

220
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,646
I really did not want to
do this right now.

221
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,067
But Jean Loring just called

222
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,736
and she said
I got to tell you right away.

223
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,895
It's okay. What's happening?

224
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,447
I told her you were in the middle of
celebrating your wedding...

225
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,778
Quentin, what's going on?

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,914
The prosecution's smoking gun

227
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,453
is a witness who is willing to
testify that you are the Green Arrow.

228
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,872
- Who?
- That information's still under seal.

229
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,498
But it's someone on the team.

230
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,399
I can't believe
this is happening again.

231
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,771
Okay, hold on a second.
We do not know

232
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,649
this is an
Evelyn Sharp situation yet.

233
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,729
It's a betrayal.

234
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,774
I never should've trusted them.

235
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,530
It's not a "them," it's a "one."

236
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,237
A one who wants to out you to the FBI
that will lock you away for life.

237
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,993
That's an awfully long time.
I'd wait for you.

238
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,540
<i>Hey, I just got your message.</i>

239
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,368
Usually, the bride and groom
like to be alone

240
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,543
on their wedding night, what's up?

241
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,662
Somebody on the team gave me up
to Samanda Watson.

242
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,293
That's impossible, Oliver.
No one would do that.

243
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,373
Lance got it from Jean Loring.

244
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,880
Jean Loring got it
from District Attorney Armand.

245
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,964
I'm running surveillance on
Curtis, Dinah and Rene

246
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,765
and I have worms crawling through
their texts and e-mails.

247
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,514
- So you're spying on them?
- I'm not spying on them.

248
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,687
More like keeping tabs.

249
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,227
Oliver, why not just
confront whoever this is

250
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,524
and give them a chance to come clean?

251
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,309
What makes you think
they're gonna be forthcoming?

252
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,822
How do we know that this isn't
just the surface of this betrayal?

253
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,820
I mean, look, John,
I don't want to spy on them.

254
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,742
If you have a better idea...

255
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,611
I'm all for it.

256
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,454
If someone goes somewhere suspicious,
we'll know.

257
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,372
Felicity, we were all
just at the wedding.

258
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,920
The most suspicious place they can go
is out for late-night pizza.

259
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,249
John, either Curtis, Dinah,
or Rene gave me up.

260
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,634
We need to know why,
we need to know who.

261
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,425
Otherwise, when you
put the hood back on,

262
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,673
you could be next.

263
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,148
All right, all right.
Where do you want to go,

264
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,225
bathroom or couch?

265
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,187
Hey, hey, I am perfectly capable
of walking myself.

266
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,901
That was not because I was drunk.

267
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,160
That is just because
I am very clumsy.

268
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,907
Wow! This is the doghouse.
Woof!

269
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,871
It's actually way cleaner
than I thought it would be.

270
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,254
Oh, look, you have flowers.
Why do you have flowers?

271
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,174
Are you seeing some lady friend
or something?

272
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,375
It's not like that.

273
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,506
You know who I'm going to see

274
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,337
when I get to my place
in the morning?

275
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,513
Some hot dude?

276
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,007
Myself.

277
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,675
In the mirror.

278
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,593
Alone.

279
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,101
<i>Do you think
it was the vigilantism</i>

280
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,764
that drove Paul away?

281
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,027
Or did I just lose my charm,
or did...

282
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,979
Do you...

283
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,492
Do you ever feel like
life would be easier

284
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,157
if there was never a Team Arrow?

285
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,657
Only all the time.

286
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,742
<i>You know what, though?</i>

287
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,625
Oliver and Felicity
got their happy ending.

288
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,753
Which is all that matters.

289
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,335
To Oliver, at least.

290
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,297
That's just the booze talking, hoss.
All right?

291
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,926
I mean, you're gonna find
someone new,

292
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,804
but until then, you got all of us.

293
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,514
That's what I get for being nice.

294
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,699
You have to stop contacting me.

295
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,623
I've done all
I'm willing to do for you.

296
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,668
I'm not here to ask for a favor.

297
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,627
Then what do you want?

298
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,046
I miss you, D.

299
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:52,756
That dress

300
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,680
reminds of the one you wore
from the Guzman op.

301
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,434
Don't do that.
Don't try to dip me in nostalgia.

302
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,808
I don't even know
who you are anymore, Vince.

303
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,069
The man I knew would never,

304
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,814
could never kill an innocent person.

305
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,822
The people I've killed
weren't innocent.

306
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,027
Oh, no?

307
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,080
Well, what about that cop
you accidentally shot last month?

308
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,032
- Collateral damage.
- What?

309
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,329
Are you trying to tell me

310
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,834
that there hasn't been any in the war
that Green Arrow's fighting?

311
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,880
No. No, there hasn't.

312
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,258
Sounds like I'm not the only one
who's changed.

313
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,428
The Dinah Drake I knew
was never this naive.

314
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:35,679
Oliver brought me back
from a very dark, very bad place.

315
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,394
He stopped me from becoming you.

316
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,563
The only difference
between him and me

317
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,811
is that I don't lie to myself
about what I'm doing.

318
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,102
Look,

319
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,608
I may not be a saint,

320
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,069
but I do know this.

321
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,159
I care about you.

322
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,746
I always have. And always will.

323
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,246
Don't contact me.

324
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,914
Leave town.

325
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,005
And if I catch you
out in the field again,

326
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,217
I won't let you get away
a second time.

327
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,510
You didn't have to walk me
all the way home, Quentin.

328
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,596
You know I can take care of myself.

329
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,976
You are still recovering from
six months in a coma, Thea.

330
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,648
Let me be
a little overprotective here.

331
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,311
Hello, Thea.

332
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,652
Congratulations on
not being comatose.

333
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,824
Cayden James
would like a word with you.

334
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,493
- Get away from him.
- Thea.

335
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,873
You just got out of the hospital.
Are you so eager to go back?

336
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,291
Thea!

337
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,120
Laurel, you...

338
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,839
Next time, I'll put you
back into a coma.

339
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,841
Speedy.

340
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,852
Could we get audio on this?

341
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,484
No, I tracked her to this location,
then accessed street cams.

342
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,278
Guess we know how Vigilante
skipped the cops last month.

343
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,075
There's no way we can tell
what she's saying to him.

344
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,151
It doesn't matter
what she's saying to him.

345
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,533
- She lied to the team about this.
- Oliver...

346
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,830
What else has she lied about?

347
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,123
Let's not get paranoid here.

348
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,874
Well, it's not paranoia
if it's a legitimate fear.

349
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,623
I mean, Vigilante
tried to kill Oliver last year,

350
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,919
he wants to out them
to law enforcement,

351
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,213
he's virtually doing the same thing.
It puts him away for life.

352
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,790
Okay. I don't think
Dinah would do this,

353
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,466
she cares way too much
about this team.

354
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,669
Oliver, listen,

355
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,470
she supported me through my injury.

356
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,596
- And as the Green Arrow...
- I know and I appreciate that.

357
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,143
But after what happened with Evelyn,

358
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,146
we need to protect ourselves.

359
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,474
Thea, are you okay?

360
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,356
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's okay.

361
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,228
What happened?

362
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,773
Evil Laurel. She took Quentin.

363
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,694
I tried to stop her, Ollie,
but I'm not strong enough anymore.

364
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,745
It's okay. It's fine.
I'm just so glad you're okay.

365
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,913
<i>Yeah,
but how are you all right?</i>

366
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,745
Not that I'm not glad
that you're okay,

367
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,827
but it's not like Evil Laurel
to leave loose ends.

368
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,123
She needed a messenger.

369
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,835
What are the chances that
that's gonna ring like, right...

370
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,337
Fantastic. That's not creepy at all.

371
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,549
<i>Hello. This is Cayden James.</i>

372
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,632
Where's Lance?

373
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,265
Now, why would I tell you that?

374
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,469
What do you want?

375
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,688
<i>A nano aluminum amplifier.</i>

376
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,391
I don't know
what you're talking about.

377
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,474
<i>Well, that's all right.</i>

378
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,693
I'm sure you can research it.

379
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,822
And when you do, you'll find
that it's secured at A.R.G.U.S.

380
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,485
Deliver it to me,
or Quentin Lance dies.

381
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,204
Last time we spoke
you vowed to destroy the city.

382
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,697
I'm guessing this amplifier

383
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,783
gets you one step closer
to completing that goal.

384
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,744
So why should I help you?

385
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,380
I did float the concept of
Mr. Lance dying, didn't I?

386
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,915
Now, you listen to me...

387
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,628
<i>At nightfall tomorrow
I will text an address to this phone.</i>

388
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,681
You'll be there with the amplifier,
or Quentin Lance

389
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,551
shuffles off this mortal coil.

390
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,103
Oh, and please don't breathe
a word of this

391
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,725
to your friends at A.R.G.U.S.

392
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,101
It's safe to say
there are no good reasons

393
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,811
that Cayden wants that amplifier.

394
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,612
- It sounds like a trap.
- He has Quentin.

395
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,447
It doesn't matter, he has leverage.

396
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,200
Can you and Curtis make
a replica of this thing,

397
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,993
a fake to pass off to Cayden James?

398
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,366
No. I mean, we're good,
but we're not that good.

399
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,446
It's one of a kind.

400
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,372
Isn't this guy
some type of genius hacker?

401
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,620
He knows it's at A.R.G.U.S.

402
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,076
Why doesn't he just
hack in there himself?

403
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,961
A.R.G.U.S. is 100% air-gapped.

404
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,255
I mean, you can't access
their network unless you're on site.

405
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,752
And I doubt he wants to
cross paths with A.R.G.U.S.

406
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,504
since they held him prisoner
for eight months.

407
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,584
He's using us instead.

408
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,636
<i>A.R. G. U. S. isn'tjust gonna
hand over this amplifier.</i>

409
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,015
They have a longstanding policy
of not negotiating with terrorists.

410
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,059
- Let's bring in Curtis and Rene.
- No Dinah?

411
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,849
Until we know
where her loyalties lie, she's out.

412
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,565
Oh, Dan, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this favor.

413
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,026
I know it's not exactly protocol
letting me in here,

414
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,574
but I wanted to leave this
little surprise for Lyla

415
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,654
for when she gets back.

416
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,410
I'm not letting protocol
get in the way of romance.

417
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,162
Yeah, well, thanks for
helping keep the flame alive.

418
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,957
I, uh, forgot my card.

419
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,464
It's back at security. I'm an idiot,
I'll go get it.

420
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,711
No, no. I'll grab it.

421
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,916
Don't need everyone to

422
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,126
see you roam around
without clearance.

423
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,377
Good idea.

424
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,091
Overwatch...

425
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:35,974
You're up, talk to me.

426
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,934
Okay, guys. I'm working on
locating the amplifier.

427
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,018
Just stand by.

428
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,571
Oh! Okay, guys, I got it.
It's in the east wing.

429
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,647
I'll shut down security
when I access

430
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,732
the panel, does everybody copy?

431
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,030
In position.

432
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,445
Still don't understand
why the brown guy's

433
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,871
gotta be the janitor, is all.

434
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,660
Janitor is
a very honorable profession.

435
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,831
They clean up after you puke, which
is something I might do very soon.

436
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,286
Why the hell isn't Dinah here?

437
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,417
Is it possible that she could be
more hungover than I am?

438
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,589
<i>- Definitely not.
- Guys, focus!</i>

439
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,641
Overwatch, I'm in position.

440
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,635
How long until security is down?

441
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,936
That depends on Curtis.

442
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,769
We're clear.

443
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,233
Also, leaning over,
not a great decision.

444
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,935
You're not throwing up.

445
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,487
I'm already spending my honeymoon
in a garbage can,

446
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,734
I'm not wearing your puke.

447
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,939
- She slapped me.
<i>- Oliver,</i>

448
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,483
I can only buy you 60 seconds

449
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,944
before the security
around the amplifier turns back on.

450
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,328
That's more than enough time for me.

451
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,950
<i>The floor's
still pressure sensitive,</i>

452
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,907
<i>if you touch it,
it will re-trigger the alarm.</i>

453
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,617
Copy that. On your count.

454
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,621
Three, two, one. Go.

455
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,789
Almost there.

456
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,893
Guys, you're about to get company.

457
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,136
We need more time.

458
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,732
Oh!

459
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,893
I got it.

460
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,447
Clear. In three, two, one.

461
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,199
How you guys doing?

462
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,708
Good news is
this is exactly what Cayden wanted.

463
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,385
- Bad news is...
- It's exactly what Cayden wanted.

464
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,012
- Yeah.
- At least now we know

465
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,384
what he's gonna use it for.

466
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,386
What, he didn't want to
supercharge his Christmas lights?

467
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,055
Remember the thermobaric bomb
that Cayden stole?

468
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,479
Well, this will multiply
the blast radius 20-fold easily.

469
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,773
That's the entire city and then some.

470
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,816
Look, I wanna save Lance
as much as anyone,

471
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,102
but he wouldn't want this.

472
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,528
I mean, he wouldn't want us to
just hand over something so dangerous

473
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,604
to some psycho.

474
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,440
Yeah. Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

475
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,526
Curtis is gonna sabotage.

476
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,776
Curtis is gonna do what, now?

477
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,828
The amplifier doesn't have to work.
We just need Cayden James

478
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,871
to think that it works long enough
for us to get Quentin back.

479
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,665
I could back-channel a path
into the circuitry.

480
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,083
If you hide it
behind the existing border,

481
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,126
it might buy us enough time to
get Lance, get the hell out of there.

482
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,247
Hi.

483
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,084
Did you guys
just get back from the field?

484
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,295
Why didn't I get a call?

485
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,677
We should speak in private.

486
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,303
That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?

487
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,723
Okay.

488
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,022
I know that you've been
meeting with the Vigilante in secret.

489
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,355
- You followed me?
- I did.

490
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,278
Whatever business I have with Vince
is none of yours.

491
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,824
It is when it threatens to
put me in prison

492
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,152
and keep me away from my son.

493
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,445
What the hell are you talking about?

494
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,372
We're talking about being arrested
off the statement of someone

495
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,699
who knows my identity.

496
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,372
Somebody on this team!

497
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,873
And you think it was me?

498
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,704
What, because I didn't tell you
about Vince?

499
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,836
I think you have given me
no reason to trust you.

500
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,464
And you, what about you?

501
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,092
You don't trust me either, John?

502
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,511
Dinah, I'm sorry.

503
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,598
Wow.

504
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,983
No. No, no. Hey, I'm the sorry one,
you know.

505
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,615
I'm the sorry one
for having your back all those times.

506
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,865
- Screw you guys.
- I'm not finished.

507
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,323
- I am.
- Hey, guys...

508
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,165
Can we all just please calm down
for a second?

509
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:22,830
<i>Look, I know everyone's stressed</i>

510
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,207
<i>because Cayden's threatening to
blow up the city,</i>

511
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:26,963
and Lance is kidnapped,

512
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,173
but let's just all
just take a breath.

513
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,962
Now I'm not saying that it's me,

514
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,044
but it can literally be
any one of us.

515
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,513
Dinah, you are the only one
who has something to hide.

516
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,765
Everyone else checked out.

517
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,969
- What does that mean?
<i>- Yeah,</i>

518
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,474
what does that mean, John?

519
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,814
It means we had you
under surveillance.

520
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,109
- All of us?
- Yeah.

521
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,654
And by "all of us" you mean
all of us.

522
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,190
So, just the newbies.

523
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,281
We're out there risking our lives
just like the rest of you are...

524
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,361
Stop.

525
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,618
Dinah isn't the witness, Oliver.

526
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,704
- You don't know that.
<i>- Yes, I do.</i>

527
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,244
Because it's me.

528
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,755
I'm the one
who's testifying against you.

529
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,009
Agent Watson came to me.

530
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,680
She said she had proof
that I was Wild Dog,

531
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,976
and that she was gonna
use it against me

532
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,395
to make sure
that I never saw Zoe again.

533
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,481
<i>She said she had a solid case
against you,</i>

534
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,526
and that she was gonna arrest you
either way.

535
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,729
<i>You were going down.</i>

536
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,156
I just couldn't make
the trip with you.

537
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,984
You should have told us, Rene.
We could have figured something out.

538
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,035
There was
nothing to figure out, hoss,

539
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,247
right? There is no other way.

540
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,744
And now we'll never know.

541
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,784
<i>Rene...</i>

542
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,328
Get out.

543
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,635
Get out.

544
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,433
Oh, good. You're awake.

545
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,945
I wanted us to
have a little daddy-daughter time.

546
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,189
Because of what happened on Lian Yu?

547
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,115
You make it sound like
I should be over it by now.

548
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,240
You shot me and left me for dead.

549
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,279
You seem to have bounced back.

550
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,114
Yeah, thanks to Cayden James.

551
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,417
He sent someone for me.

552
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,832
I'm sorry, I made a mistake
shooting you.

553
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,001
<i>I'm glad you're okay.</i>

554
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,757
- Then you're an idiot.
- You're probably right.

555
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,468
You're probably right.

556
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,129
Listen,

557
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,719
when you, uh, look at me,

558
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,768
do see your own father

559
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,054
at all?

560
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,639
No.

561
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,943
Because my father died
when I was 13.

562
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,570
What happened?

563
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,697
It was my 13th birthday.

564
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,824
And he left
to go get my birthday cake

565
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:01,947
like he did every year.

566
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,032
And then the phone rang.

567
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,576
There was an accident. A drunk driver
ran through a red light.

568
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,453
Head-on collision.

569
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,622
I'm sorry.

570
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,671
<i>I used to pick up Laurel's cake, too.</i>

571
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,174
Yellow with chocolate frosting.

572
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,593
From her favorite bakery.

573
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,217
Carly's.

574
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,224
<i>I'm sorry you didn't get to
know your father.</i>

575
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,598
I guess you're stuck knowing me.

576
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,809
<i>Okay, it's time.</i>

577
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,074
Remember, if Green Arrow
reneges on our deal, you kill him.

578
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,576
How can you eat this?

579
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,002
You ask me that every time.

580
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,041
He means at a time like this.

581
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,668
Stress makes me hungry.

582
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,792
So does guilt.

583
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,419
I just...

584
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,546
I screwed up,

585
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,429
you know, Oliver was right
to kick me off the team.

586
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,310
You were in
an impossible position.

587
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,262
Yeah, and when you're in
an impossible position

588
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,848
that's why there's a team, D.

589
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,475
Just like Dig said.

590
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,818
You're uncharacteristically
quiet, hoss.

591
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,482
I'm just hungover.

592
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,579
Doing some processing. I'm actually
doing a lot of processing.

593
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,531
Oliver spying on us, you mean.

594
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,286
I'm not gonna pretend
there's not a difference between

595
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,208
the three of us
and the three of them,

596
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,661
the original three, but...

597
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,668
Spying on us? I mean, come on.
That crosses a line.

598
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,425
Yeah. And I just don't like the way
that it makes me feel.

599
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,088
Now I'm stressed.

600
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,178
Wow.

601
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,893
It's good. It's real good.

602
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,024
- Hey.
- Hi.

603
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,694
Felicity told me what happened.

604
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,237
Yeah.

605
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,702
I would ask if you're okay, but I

606
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,871
think I already know the answer.

607
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,037
Thinking about what Rene did.

608
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,915
What do you do, really?

609
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,175
He kept a secret,

610
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,590
and he put his daughter
ahead of the team.

611
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,341
And I feel betrayed.

612
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,509
How can I feel betrayed

613
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,897
by somebody doing
the exact same things that I've done?

614
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,976
Because you've never
sold anyone out on the team, Ollie.

615
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,941
And if you're convicted,

616
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,648
you could end up spending a really

617
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,988
long time in jail.

618
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,487
But having said that,

619
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,495
you're doing
the right thing looking

620
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,040
at things through his perspective.

621
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,870
And having done that...

622
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,211
Maybe you can see
your way to forgiving him.

623
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,459
Seriously?

624
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,378
Well, Rene is a...

625
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,550
A very desperate guy
who just did a

626
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,680
very desperate thing.

627
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,309
But he's also the same guy
who, just last night,

628
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,813
was giving such
a heartfelt sweet speech,

629
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,685
and calling you his friend.

630
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,486
And I really think
that he meant that.

631
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,317
It was a betrayal, no question.

632
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,443
But since you've been able to
see things

633
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,119
from his point of view,

634
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,574
you should also be able to
see your way to forgiving him.

635
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,909
Listen to you.

636
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,797
<i>Quentin needs the team
right now, Ollie.</i>

637
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,083
But he needs the whole one.

638
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,295
It's almost nightfall.

639
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,131
Let's have the team suit up.

640
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,258
<i>John...</i>

641
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,350
- The whole team.
- Copy that.

642
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,321
Thanks for having me back, man.

643
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,152
Let's get our friend back.

644
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,904
This is where Cayden James wants to
make the exchange?

645
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,705
Yeah, it's a no-brainer
he picked this place.

646
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,455
It's a digital black hole.
There's no cameras, insulated walls.

647
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,540
Once you guys get inside,
I'm totally blind.

648
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,920
Well, that means so is he.

649
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,089
- Did you get the amplifier working?
- I hope so,

650
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,916
'cause otherwise we'd be
handing a crazy psychopath

651
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,592
the means to crater the entire city.

652
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,470
I mean, yes. Yes, it's ready.

653
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,924
I'll handle the exchange.
You three will be my eyes and ears.

654
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,974
The priority is extracting Quentin,

655
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,018
<i>but if we get a chance
to take Cayden James into custody,</i>

656
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,095
<i>we take it.</i>

657
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,931
Whatever we're going through,
whatever issues we have,

658
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,187
let's put it aside
and get the job done.

659
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,436
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

660
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,358
Agreed.

661
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,314
Okay. Let's go.

662
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,365
So we meet again.

663
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,991
Where's Lance?

664
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,286
Oh. Somewhere handy.

665
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,505
I'll be taking that amplifier now.

666
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,460
You will be telling me
where Lance is.

667
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,586
A fair request.

668
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,762
Equally fair, lay down your bow.

669
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,843
I'll let you speak with him.

670
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,564
I am a man of my word.

671
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,934
If I wasn't, there wouldn't be
much point in

672
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,643
vowing to destroy this city.

673
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,478
Would there?

674
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,575
No sign of Lance or Laurel.

675
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,369
We can't see anything from up here.

676
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:38,863
Let's search the building.

677
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,495
Green Arrow said stay put
until he makes the exchange.

678
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,502
What, we're his eyes and ears
and we can't even look around?

679
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,874
<i>Guys, we need you as backup.</i>

680
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,830
Well, maybe if you'd bugged Lance
like you bugged us,

681
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,914
we'd know where he was.

682
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,251
Whoa! We didn't bug you guys.
We tracked your GPS.

683
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,425
It's totally different.

684
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,878
You're bugging me now.

685
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,762
<i>You know I can hear you
through Wild Dog's comms,</i>

686
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,761
<i>you know that, right?</i>

687
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:58,887
Screw it.

688
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,718
I'm not gonna sit around here
and wait for Oliver to

689
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,973
decide to trust us again.

690
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,535
See? Wasn't that easy?

691
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,451
Are you all right?

692
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,878
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Accommodations could be nicer.

693
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,954
But yeah, I'm fine.

694
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,749
Yeah, well, sit tight.
I'll be there soon.

695
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,715
Yeah, just don't compromise
the city's safety for me, all right?

696
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,509
Now there's
a dedicated civil servant.

697
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,010
I wish there were more like him.

698
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,346
Proof of life, as requested.

699
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,386
Your turn now, I think.

700
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,347
Take what you wanted.

701
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,103
Mmm.

702
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,684
I think not.

703
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,568
<i>You see, what I wanted was
a nano aluminum amplifier.</i>

704
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,609
One that hasn't been sabotaged.

705
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,569
He knows.

706
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,246
That makes no sense.
How could he know?

707
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:03,906
I'm disappointed.

708
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,335
Though not nearly as much, I imagine,
as your friend Mr. Lance.

709
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,079
Kill him.

710
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,122
And kill him.

711
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,515
Team, everything's gone south.

712
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,689
Back up Green Arrow.

713
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,449
Wild Dog, Terrific,
where are you guys?

714
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,125
- We're on our way.
- On your way?

715
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,201
Why weren't you in position?

716
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,836
Don't got time for that now, hoss!

717
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,130
We got eyes on Lance.

718
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,150
James is gone.
His men are down.

719
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,856
Where the hell is everybody?

720
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,149
I've got Lance and Laurel.

721
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,404
<i>They're exiting
the north side of the building.</i>

722
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,484
I'm on my way.

723
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,495
Laurel's getting away with Lance.

724
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,197
We've got company.

725
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,087
Okay. One last stop.

726
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,423
Run.

727
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,518
Laurel.

728
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,783
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

729
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:12,914
Thanks for coming to get me.

730
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,254
<i>- Can I get a sitrep?
- Is everyone okay?</i>

731
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,967
Yeah. We're good here.

732
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,898
- How's Lance?
- He's fine. Sleeping it off.

733
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,359
Any sign of Cayden James
or Black Siren?

734
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,228
<i>Nada</i>. They're completely
off the grid.

735
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,692
But we got Quentin back.

736
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,690
- That was the objective, right?
- Right.

737
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,783
You and Rene were
supposed to be backup.

738
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,946
- Where'd you go?
- We were looking for Lance.

739
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,659
And from what I can tell,
we found him.

740
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,368
Moving off of your position,
was that

741
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,503
your call or Curtis'?

742
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,206
- Look, I was right there beside him...
- It was my call.

743
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,043
And it turned out to be right one.

744
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,049
You got lucky, Rene.
It doesn't make it the right call.

745
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,129
Look, man,

746
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,301
I know you're pissed at me

747
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,762
and I don't care.

748
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,559
Because you left us blind out there.

749
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,886
And I wasn't gonna let Lance die

750
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,221
just because you didn't
trust us enough

751
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,646
to go off leash and look for him.

752
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,771
When you are in the field,
there is a clear chain of command.

753
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,894
Plain and simple.

754
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,980
I've been the same guy tonight
that I've always been

755
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,066
- since you brought me onto this team.
- Rene, yes, that's true, you have.

756
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,735
- Sometimes you go your own way.
- That's right.

757
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,746
And I put up with it
because I trusted you.

758
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,905
What's that supposed to mean?

759
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,912
<i>You got a second chance tonight,
my friend.</i>

760
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,293
And you broke our trust again.

761
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:38,996
You don't get a third.

762
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,458
You're off the team.

763
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,966
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

764
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,133
It's been real, y'all.

765
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,641
You know, I hate to say it,
but Oliver is right.

766
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,854
We're a team,
we need to trust each other.

767
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,651
We need to believe in each other.

768
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,946
I don't believe in you anymore.

769
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,995
- Dinah.
- Don't.

770
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,073
It's too late.

771
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,367
I'm out, too.

772
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,563
Guess we should both be glad
I didn't leave town like you said.

773
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,392
Oh, thanks. That's really
what I needed right now,

774
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,726
an "I told you so."

775
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,403
Are you okay? You don't look it.

776
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,236
I really don't want to talk about it.

777
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,568
Then why'd you reach out?

778
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,403
'Cause I had no one else to call.

779
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,454
I'll try not to be insulted by that.

780
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,960
I really needed someone who

781
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,871
believed in me.

782
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,045
I needed a friend.

783
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,293
Friends?

784
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,505
I can do that.

785
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,231
Sunflowers. My favorite.

786
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,976
Well, I wanted it to feel like home.

787
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,985
I'm not gonna have to
leave again, am I?

788
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,148
Hey.

789
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,659
I won't let anyone
split us up ever again.

790
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,737
I promise.

791
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,580
I'm just gonna say this.

792
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,798
I don't think there's
anything that has been said or done

793
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:51,129
- that can't be undone.
- I don't think I agree, John.

794
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,633
<i>I agree with Felicity.</i>

795
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,172
We need to move forward.

796
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,883
Sorry I'm late.

797
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,220
I think I probably
might still be a little hungover.

798
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,140
<i>I've also been thinking about
a few things.</i>

799
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,401
Oliver, you and Dinah were right.

800
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,105
<i>No trust, no team.</i>

801
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,154
You all spied on me.

802
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,028
Invaded my privacy.

803
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,327
Now, whether you couldn't
trust me or not,

804
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,372
it means that I can't trust you.

805
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,254
Curtis, what's that supposed to mean?

806
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,003
I'm still a part of
Helix Dynamics, Felicity.

807
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,666
That's separate.

808
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,168
But...

809
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,878
This...

810
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,555
I'm done.

811
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,531
Like I said, we need to move forward.

812
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,153
- Oliver...
- Cayden James knew

813
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,406
that we sabotaged the amplifier
last night.

814
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:58,987
We need to find out how.

815
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,704
When you had me raid their bunker

816
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,915
and plant that mini-cam
two months ago...

817
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,543
Is this the outcome I had in mind?
Quite so, Ms. Lance.

818
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,503
Although I must confess,

819
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,007
things have worked out
even better than I anticipated.

820
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,466
<i>Hardly impressive.</i>

821
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,977
Left to his own devices,

822
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,561
Oliver Queen will always push away
those closest to him.

823
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,729
So we've got 'em fighting with
each other instead of fighting us.

824
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,980
Please tell me

825
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,990
that isn't your whole master plan.

826
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,818
Oh, not at all, Mr. Diaz.

827
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,825
In fact, I think it fair to say
that this

828
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,616
is only the beginning.
