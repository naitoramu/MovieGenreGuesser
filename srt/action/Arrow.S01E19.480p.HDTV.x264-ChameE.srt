1
00:00:01,187 --> 00:00:04,540
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,824
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:09,993
survive.

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:11,811
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:14,414
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,583
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:20,003
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,941
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:27,427
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:28,845
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:30,380
Who supplies you with Vertigo?

12
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:31,831
They call him
the Count!

13
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:36,637
56 people died
to perfect this high.

14
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,957
I've never seen anyone od on
this much Vertigo and live.

15
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,059
The police never caught
your brother's shooter.

16
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,716
The bullets were laced
with curare, that's

17
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,480
Floyd Lawton's M.O.

18
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,698
Lawton's alive.
I'm sorry, John.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,983
This Lawton guy
kick his dog or something?

20
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:53,070
He killed
his brother.

21
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:42,068
How we doing?

22
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,688
We're in the black,
and the green.

23
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,041
I like how we've gone from throwing
money at clubs to catching it.

24
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:49,876
Oh, look at these.

25
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:51,745
What sort of business
has a lost and found

26
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:53,630
that's just filled
with women's underwear?

27
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:55,132
The best business ever?

28
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:57,517
Ohh, having this much fun
should be against the law.

29
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,586
Oh, if wishing made it so.

30
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:01,421
Sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

31
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,774
Is Laurel ok?
She's fine.

32
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,642
This visit is about
something else.

33
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:08,612
A girl just got mowed down
a couple blocks from here.

34
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:11,715
On Starling bridge.

35
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,533
Ring any bells with you two?

36
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,569
No.
Should she?

37
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:18,955
She was in
your club tonight.

38
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:20,123
A lot of people were.

39
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,541
You think someone killed her?

40
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:22,942
Not someone.

41
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,578
Something.

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,713
Vertigo.

43
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:30,050
Yeah. You got a problem
with that in this club?

44
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,785
Not that
I'm aware of.

45
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:34,087
We don't allow drugs
in here, Detective.

46
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,125
Control your clientele.

47
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,645
Before anyone else
wanders into traffic.

48
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,567
Is there any chance she could
have scored the drugs in here?

49
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,404
I doubt it. I try not
to hire too many drug dealers.

50
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:51,971
Get me a list
of employees, anyway.

51
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,874
I'll have Felicity cross reference
it for drug arrests.

52
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,493
That includes
the two of us, you know.

53
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:00,113
I thought the Vigilante
finished off the Count.

54
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,884
I did.

55
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,986
I just need to ask him
a few questions, Doc.

56
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,789
Well, you're welcome
to try, Detective,

57
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,173
but I'm not sure you'll get
very far with him.

58
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,224
What does that mean?

59
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,249
Is this a load about
doctor-patient privilege?

60
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:16,046
No, far from it. The unrefined
Vertigo overdose he suffered

61
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:19,383
caused damage to the caudal portion
of his anterior cingulate.

62
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,851
Well, you'll probably be
shocked to hear

63
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:22,386
that I didn't go
to medical school.

64
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:23,987
I've been working
with him for months now.

65
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,606
And all I've gotten
out of him is word salad

66
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:28,608
and the occasional
spit in the face.

67
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,644
Best of luck to you.
Thanks.

68
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:38,735
Here I was born,
and there I died.

69
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:41,538
It was only
a moment for you.

70
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,708
You took no notice.

71
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:51,081
A woman died tonight...

72
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,716
from your poison.

73
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,202
Lots of women die,
lots of nights,

74
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,487
for lots of reasons.

75
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,590
Someone is selling Vertigo
again. Where is it coming from?

76
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:03,393
I remember you.

77
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:06,012
Man in hood.

78
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:11,184
You are never far
from my thoughts.

79
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,825
You have
failed this city!

80
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:21,828
You have
failed this city!

81
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,230
You have
failed this city!

82
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,836
You could have just
said he was nuts.

83
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,706
You failed this city!

84
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,614
All right!
You're teaching me that one.

85
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:59,483
Only if you show me
where the knife was.

86
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,106
Who taught you
how to fight?

87
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,625
My father wanted a son.

88
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:11,745
He got one.

89
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:14,080
The tension of that
bow's 150 pounds.

90
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:17,467
Snap it, you'll both be covered
by fiber shrapnel in your eyes.

91
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:19,836
She's right.
You're not strong enough, kid.

92
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,471
Go again?

93
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:22,973
It's pretty exciting

94
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:25,425
that both of you are
such bad asses,

95
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:26,541
but do you think that
maybe we should be

96
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,012
making a plan to stop Fyers?

97
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,897
And, I don't know...
Save your dad?

98
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,465
Does he always
whine this much?

99
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,485
Today's one of his good days.

100
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,604
Can he fight?

101
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:40,156
I've tried.
Never much success.

102
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:41,825
I'm sitting right here.

103
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:44,411
Well, I haven't tried yet.

104
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,155
Uncle John.
Hey, buddy.

105
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:58,592
Will you read
"Logan Bogan" to me?

106
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,290
Sweetheart, get into bed

107
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:01,345
and mommy will read
to you in a minute.

108
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,847
But I want Uncle John
to read to me!

109
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,615
Uncle John's had
a long day.

110
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,884
He'll read to you
next time.

111
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:14,608
Hey, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,777
I've been some place else today.

113
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,363
What's going on
with you?

114
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,881
I'm just trying
to figure some stuff out.

115
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,517
If you need to talk
about anything,

116
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,319
you know
I'm here for you.

117
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,466
It is Oliver Queen,
with an emergency.

118
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:41,568
Got to go.

119
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:44,838
Got here as quickly
as I could.

120
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,506
This about the glyph
in your father's notebook?

121
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:47,891
Felicity is still
working on that.

122
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:49,092
We have another problem.

123
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:52,012
Starling City
is once again at war

124
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:54,147
with the drug known on
the streets as Vertigo.

125
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,815
It used to be the city's
most lethal vice,

126
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:57,550
but the purple
and green pill

127
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,070
was nowhere to be found
for the last 3 months.

128
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,938
Over the past few days, the city
has been flooded

129
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,573
with a new version
of Vertigo.

130
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,892
More addictive,
more unstable.

131
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:07,694
It killed a girl
in the club.

132
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:10,396
Just like it
almost killed Thea.

133
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:12,599
Ok, what are you think?
We should pay the Count a visit?

134
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,502
He was my first visit.
Waste of time.

135
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,121
He's...sumasshedshiy.

136
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:19,923
Ahh.

137
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,842
Since he was the only one that
knew the forumla for Vertigo,

138
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,094
I don't...

139
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,079
I don't even know
where to begin.

140
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:27,631
Good, you're here.

141
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,415
Of course you're here.
Where else would you be?

142
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,917
You clearly
love it down here.

143
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,086
You got to see this.

144
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:37,641
I'm here at the scene
where police say

145
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,092
a disturbed patient

146
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:40,927
escaped only hours ago.

147
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:43,613
Authorities issued
an immediate lockdown

148
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,949
at the Starling County
Institute for Mental Health

149
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,651
following the breakout.

150
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,869
Police are warning people
to avoid contact

151
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:52,455
with the drug dealer
known as the Count.

152
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,240
Not so crazy
after all, huh?

153
00:07:56,206 --> 00:08:00,206

155
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:09,821
I was administering his meds.
He was babbling.

156
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,189
His usual ranting,
then he's ice cold.

157
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,444
He overpowered me.

158
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,626
He forced me to take him out
through the maintenance exit.

159
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,895
I thought he was harmless.
Basically a vegetable, you said.

160
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,247
I know. Which means...

161
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,583
I've interviewed him
dozens of times

162
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,702
in the past few months.

163
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:25,120
To be deceived by
a patient so completely--

164
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,788
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

165
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,791
He's going to find prison
a lot harder to break out of.

166
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,376
Detective...

167
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,028
He's dangerous.

168
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,113
Don't underestimate him.

169
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,018
Did we get anything
from the security cameras?

170
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,670
Not according
to the orderly here.

171
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:45,523
Due to budget cuts, the
cameras were the first to go.

172
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,858
That is unbelievable.

173
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,426
There's another angle.

174
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,362
Veronica Sparks,
the dead girl from Verdant?

175
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,948
Yeah?
I checked her LUDs.

176
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,116
The last person
she texted before she died

177
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,451
was Tommy Merlyn.

178
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,286
He said
he didn't know her.

179
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,872
Merlyn has two collars for
possession, one with intent.

180
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,741
Yeah, that was over
five years ago.

181
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,709
Maybe he's just better at
not getting himself arrested.

182
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,379
Well, Laurel says he's changed
ever since his father cut him off.

183
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,830
Yeah, a leopard
and his spots, you know?

184
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,254
Maybe pushing Vertigo
at his new club

185
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:12,956
is a way of maintaining
his old lifestyle.

186
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,541
Yeah, or maybe
going after Meryln's

187
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:16,209
a great way
to get my daughter

188
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:17,877
to stop speaking
to me again, Hilt.

189
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,046
Look, Quentin,
you know I get that.

190
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:21,395
But here's the thing--
on a hunch,

191
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,420
I subpoenaed
the club's bank accounts.

192
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:26,052
There's ten large missing
from their operating expenses.

193
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:28,304
You think Merlyn spent
that money on Vertigo?

194
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:31,107
I think I can't explain how that
much money just gets misplaced.

195
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:33,176
Look, I'll take a run at it.

196
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:34,694
Keep you out of it.
No.

197
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:37,180
I should do it.

198
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:48,357
What you need?

199
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,343
All right.

200
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,046
The person of color has
successfully purchased your drugs.

201
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,015
For the record, I offered.

202
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,100
How will we know
when the tracker is active?

203
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:16,436
It already is.
I'm getting a good signal

204
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,655
off the monofilament strips
we placed in the bills.

205
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,940
Drug money's like a pigeon--
it always finds its way home.

206
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:23,359
We can follow the money
all the way back to the Count.

207
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,728
Keep tracking it.

208
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,563
Well, what are you going to do
with all the Vertigo you bought?

209
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:29,415
Plan on having
a party, Felicity?

210
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,701
My only experience with
drugs was an encounter

211
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,757
with a pot brownie
my freshman year--

212
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:35,116
by mistake.

213
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:38,675
Which could have been fun,
except I'm allergic to nuts.

214
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,293
All right, head shot.

215
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,245
Kills again,
this time a U.S. senator.

216
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:43,713
Where have you been
tracking him?

217
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:46,249
Not very far.
I ran his Floyd Lawton alias

218
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:48,351
through every conceivable
law enforcement database.

219
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:51,120
He's made a series of calls
to an Alberto Garcia.

220
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:53,059
Huh.
According to NSA,

221
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,917
Garcia's a reputed
underworld talent scout.

222
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:57,593
He books all
the Deadshot's hits.

223
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:00,980
It's not much
to go on, but...

224
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:03,099
Yeah, but it's
something, Felicity, thanks.

225
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,701
Don't you think
Oliver should know?

226
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:06,686
No, this is personal.

227
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:10,373
Lawton is my problem
to deal with.

228
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,627
What brings you by?

229
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:17,063
Hey, would you like
some dinner?

230
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:19,082
Your daughter ordered
way too much Thai food.

231
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:21,217
No, thanks.

232
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:24,387
This is a business
visit, actually.

233
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,424
I got some follow up questions
on the Sparks' girl's death.

234
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:31,511
Sure. The girl was in the club
before she got run-over.

235
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:33,997
You said you didn't
know her, but, um,

236
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,465
but the last text
off her phone was to you.

237
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,569
Really? Because, uh...

238
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,471
Well, I'll be damned.

239
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,619
Huh. Well, I didn't reply.

240
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:47,778
I get a hundred texts
like this a night.

241
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,495
People wanting
to get into the club.

242
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:52,498
So that's what she meant by,
"Can you hook me up?"

243
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,350
What else would it be about?

244
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:58,705
$10,000 is missing from
your club's bank accounts.

245
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:01,007
What'd you spend
the money on?

246
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,092
No idea. There must be some sort
of bookkeeping error--

247
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:05,178
Ok, let me put this
another way--

248
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,347
if you spent that money on Vertigo
so that you could "hook up"

249
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:08,915
your clientele--
Dad!

250
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,266
Then the best thing
for you right now

251
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:12,218
is to cop to it, ok?
Get out in front of this.

252
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,303
Don't say anything.

253
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:14,503
I am trying to--

254
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:15,955
To do your job?
Yeah, I know.

255
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:17,140
And this is me doing mine.

256
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:19,642
Laurel, I know
I look like

257
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:21,544
the disapproving
father--again.

258
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:25,615
But I came down here
so another cop wouldn't.

259
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:28,351
You understand?

260
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:30,403
Tommy, I...

261
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:32,521
I'm not hungry
anymore.

262
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:55,178
Hold up hand up.

263
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,181
Palm facing me.

264
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,217
Hit the water.

265
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:03,686
What?
Hit it.

266
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,824
Again.

267
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,028
Again. Harder.

268
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,396
If the point of this

269
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:15,731
is to make me feel like
an idiot, it's working.

270
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,252
"A journey
of a thousand miles

271
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,337
begins with
a single step."

272
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:23,339
Confucius, great.

273
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:25,741
I'm starting to see
the family resemblance.

274
00:13:25,743 --> 00:13:28,261
Laozi, actually. Again.

275
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,597
Now what?

276
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:34,583
Fill the bowl.
Start again.

277
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,104
What have you got?

278
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:39,939
The end
of the money trail.

279
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,975
Sending the dealer's
location to you now.

280
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:02,445
Oh, hey! Hey, dude.

281
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:15,591
Hey yo.

282
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,977
Who's looking to party?

283
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:20,463
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

284
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,298
That's not enough, man.

285
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,434
You don't pay,
you don't play.

286
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:27,437
It's all right.
Good for business.

287
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,490
My boss seems to like you, G.
That's right.

288
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,645
Hey, hey, come here.
How much for this?

289
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:38,147
Now that...

290
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,533
That'll buy you
a brick, my man.

291
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:54,297
Go, go, go!

292
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:24,208
Don't forget
to breathe.

293
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,878
He won't.
I won't.

294
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:34,135
Congratulations.

295
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,454
You're officially the creepiest
person I've ever met.

296
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:37,922
I don't--I don't
feel so good.

297
00:15:37,924 --> 00:15:40,792
Get away from me, creep.

298
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:42,794
Have we got a problem?

299
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:45,263
Are you ok?

300
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:51,436
All units,
all units, code 99.

301
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:54,239
417 in progress, Starling Aquarium.
All available units--

302
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,608
this just came over
the police frequency.

303
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,778
I hacked the aquarium
security system to get a better look.

304
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:04,616
Bystanders said
they saw him pop

305
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,034
some green and black pills...

306
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:16,377
There's a lunatic
high on Vertigo who's taking hostages,

307
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:19,848
and you're making--
making tea.

308
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,519
They're medicinal herbs
from the island.

309
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:27,171
They counter balance the effects
of certain drugs and poisons.

310
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:31,476
They should counteract
the effects of Vertigo.

311
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:32,944
And you aren't
going to--

312
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:35,513
What?
You know...

313
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:37,899
My sister got high
on this garbage.

314
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,389
Could have killed someone.

315
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,325
She didn't deserve
an arrow in the heart.

316
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:44,656
This guy didn't fail the city.

317
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,491
The city failed him.

318
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:49,761
And so did I.

319
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:51,529
What's happening now
isn't your fault.

320
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,331
You didn't make him
take drugs.

321
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,966
No, but I did fail to put the Count
in a grave so deep

322
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,584
that he couldn't come back
and hurt anyone again.

323
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:57,886
You caught him.
They locked him up.

324
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,521
And now the city is on fire!

325
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:02,423
So clearly, it wasn't
the right decision.

326
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:13,234
Get in touch with Diggle.

327
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:14,684
With the security feed out,

328
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,776
I'm going need a second
set of eyes at the aquarium.

329
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,835
Glad I caught you stateside.

330
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:34,272
Just barely. I leave in
two days for Pyongyang.

331
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,507
Isn't that classified?

332
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:39,344
I figure an old army
buy can keep a secret.

333
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:41,245
I was glad
to get your call.

334
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:45,433
Lyla, that's not why I called.

335
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,685
There's something else
you'd like me

336
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,721
to do for you, then.
Well, actually,

337
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:51,639
I think there's something
I can do for you.

338
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,691
I'm going to go out on a limb
and assume that Deadshot

339
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,810
is on Argus'
most wanted list.

340
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:57,679
What do you know about him?

341
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,398
Well, his name, for starters.
Floyd Lawton.

342
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,434
We don't even have that.
Where'd you get it?

343
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,703
Same place I got this.

344
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,906
This is everything
you need to locate

345
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:11,342
who's giving Deadshot
his targets.

346
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,745
What's your interest in this?

347
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,713
Lawton came up in connection with
some things I'm working on.

348
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:18,466
I thought you were
the right person to pass it off to.

349
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:21,920
I remember you being
a better liar than that, Johnny.

350
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:24,722
Listen, Lyla, Lawton
is a very dangerous man.

351
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,507
And your people are the most
qualified to take him down.

352
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,759
It's that simple.

353
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:30,011
Nothing in our business
is simple.

354
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:46,444
Me to ask for my help again,
Mr. Lance?

355
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:49,530
Eric Messner?

356
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:51,449
Who?

357
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:54,485
He's a zoning commissioner
for Starling City.

358
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:56,421
A notoriously corrupt one,
at that.

359
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:59,924
Missing ten grand.
You paid it to him

360
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:02,093
to skip the inspection
of your nightclub.

361
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:05,129
Why'd you do that, Merlyn?
What didn't you want him to find?

362
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,581
We got nothing
to hide here.

363
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,517
Great. Then let's just
take a little look around.

364
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,168
Absolutely.

365
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,104
When you come back
with a search warrant.

366
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,345
Are you sure this is how
you want to play this?

367
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:25,216
Apparently.

368
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:29,120
Doesn't my daughter
know how to pick 'em.

369
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,444
Stop laughing at me!

370
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:40,581
Shut up!

371
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,050
Shut up!

372
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:03,905
Stop! I don't want to hurt you.

373
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:12,830
I'm here to help you.

374
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,588
Hey, hey.

375
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:30,682
My mom does yoga.

376
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,535
Hey, remember when Slade
and I rescued you?

377
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,970
You rescued me?

378
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:39,924
Fine. When we all
rescued each other.

379
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:43,277
You said you knew
why Fyers wanted Yao Fei,

380
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,531
and how he was
forcing him to help.

381
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:48,533
Feel like sharing?

382
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:52,537
We're almost out
of slapping water.

383
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:00,878
My father was a Shangjiang
in the People's Liberation Army.

384
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,581
A general. I didn't hear
the details of Fyers plans,

385
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,951
but he wants my father
to be the face of it.

386
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:09,387
A scapegoat.
To take the blame

387
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,506
and conceal
their own involvement.

388
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:14,425
Why was Yao Fei
on the island in the first place?

389
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:17,478
Fyers says he murdered people.

390
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:20,932
No, he didn't.

391
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:24,352
The Chinese military
comitted the massacre.

392
00:21:24,354 --> 00:21:26,237
Someone had
to take the blame.

393
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,973
They chose him.

394
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:31,776
Sent him to this
island for life.

395
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:33,945
I spent years
looking for him.

396
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:36,497
A few months ago, a man
came to my apartment.

397
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:39,917
Said he had information
about my father's whereabouts.

398
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,537
I had given up hope.

399
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:47,725
Let my guard down.
Didn't see the tazer until...

400
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:49,961
When I woke up,
I was here.

401
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:59,637
I'm worried.
This island...

402
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:03,340
What he must have had
to do to survive.

403
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:05,393
That it changed him.

404
00:22:05,395 --> 00:22:08,012
He saved my life.

405
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:11,032
He's still a good man, Shado.

406
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:18,790
Again.

407
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,878
So there I am sitting
at our favorite Sushi restaurant,

408
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,663
a bottle of saki,

409
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:29,500
and the only thing
that's missing is my boyfriend.

410
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:31,702
My God, I'm so
sorry, baby.

411
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:34,839
I just have
a lot going on here.

412
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,258
Tommy, whatever's
going on with you,

413
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,726
I want you to know
I believe you.

414
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:41,095
I'm here for you.

415
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:45,766
Sorry.

416
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,268
Ollie.

417
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,486
What's wrong?

418
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:49,737
Bad night.

419
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:52,273
It's about to get worse.
Mr. Meryln,

420
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:54,909
as requested, a warrant to search
these premises.

421
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:57,395
I can't believe
you're doing this.

422
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:59,280
Believe it.
Detective,

423
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:01,782
I'm not an attorney,
but on what grounds

424
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:03,451
are you searching my club?

425
00:23:03,453 --> 00:23:05,253
Your general manager bribed
a government official to keep him

426
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:07,538
from inspecting
the entirety of your building.

427
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,873
What?

428
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,708
Because he's selling
Vertigo out of the club.

429
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,577
Ollie, it's valid.
Thank you.

430
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:15,379
A sub level
is not listed

431
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:17,215
on the inspection's
floor plans.

432
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:19,300
However, I pulled
the county records.

433
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:21,469
There's something
down there.

434
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:24,255
I want to see
for myself what it is.

435
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:26,941
Oh, look at that.

436
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:30,394
Open the door.

437
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,535
You're making a mistake.

438
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:39,620
No. You are.

439
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,956
If you don't
open that door.

440
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,293
I said, open the door.

441
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:10,867
Thank you.

442
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,201
The place is kind of a mess.

443
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:32,121
I've been using it to store
the bulk of our inventory.

444
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:35,191
What's in the boxes?

445
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:37,860
Why don't you
have a look.

446
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,215
Well, if prohibition
were still in effect,

447
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:44,717
you might actually have a basis
of a criminal complaint.

448
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,886
Would you like to open
the rest of the crates?

449
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:00,900
So if you don't have
anything to hide...

450
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:04,470
Why didn't you want
the inspector down here?

451
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,124
Well, the ventilation
system in this place

452
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:11,160
hasn't been updated
since the sixties.

453
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,863
Maybe we shouldn't
even be open.

454
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,919
Yeah.

455
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:24,707
I'm sorry.

456
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:26,226
I thought he was ok
with us being together.

457
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:27,877
He wasn't wrong.
I bribed a guy.

458
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,929
That's not why
he brought out his jackboots.

459
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,580
It's all gonna be fine.

460
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:34,050
I'll see you at home.

461
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:35,134
Good night.

462
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,585
Good night.

463
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:38,688
Is there something
you want to say to me?

464
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,922
Thank you.

465
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:41,274
No, I meant the thing
that you were thinking

466
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:43,309
when Lance accused me
of dealing out of the club.

467
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,944
I don't understand
why you wouldn't

468
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:46,929
just tell me about
the bribe.

469
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:48,931
I run the club,
Oliver.

470
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:50,733
I don't tell you
a lot of things.

471
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:52,986
So let me ask you
a question, pal.

472
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:55,888
What have I done in the last
6 months since you've been home

473
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,125
that would lead you
to believe that I would sell drugs?

474
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:01,311
In the last 6 months?
Nothing.

475
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:02,229
Yeah.

476
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,247
Before I left,
you played hard.

477
00:26:04,249 --> 00:26:06,615
You played with bad people
who were into bad stuff.

478
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:08,885
And so did you,
Oliver.

479
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:11,638
But I changed
just like you did.

480
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,225
Now you put arrows in people
who do illegal things.

481
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:19,762
Last time I checked, bribing
a city inspector was not legal.

482
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:23,933
Do you actually think
that I could hurt you?

483
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:26,202
Truthfully, I have no idea what
the hell you would do.

484
00:26:26,204 --> 00:26:28,368
You are a complete
mystery to me.

485
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:32,553
I've got no idea how you find it
so easy to kill people.

486
00:26:34,056 --> 00:26:37,041
The next time you decide to think
the worst of me,

487
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:38,860
imagine what I now
think of you.

488
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:48,018
What's his problem?

489
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,354
What's yours?

490
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:51,572
Excuse me?

491
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:53,975
I asked Felicity
to get in touch with you.

492
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:57,078
There was a hostage
situation at the aquarium.

493
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,380
I'm sorry, I didn't get
that message till it was over.

494
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:00,548
Why?

495
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,334
Because I was busy
doing something else.

496
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:07,171
Lawton.

497
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:09,390
Oliver, you didn't
end up needing me.

498
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:10,558
You couldn't have
known that.

499
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,176
In other words,

500
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:13,895
find your brother's killer
on your own time, right?

501
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:16,013
Vertigo's tearing
this city apart, Diggle.

502
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:18,499
So, yeah, maybe now's
not the best time

503
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:20,118
to indulge
a personal vendetta.

504
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,436
You're actually gonna stand
there and tell me

505
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:24,489
that you going after
the Count is not personal?

506
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:27,358
Oliver, listen, I cannot read
a book to my nephew

507
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,226
without knowing that Lawton
took his father from him.

508
00:27:29,228 --> 00:27:32,080
I can't move on with Carly,
I can't move on with my life

509
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:35,750
knowing that he's
still out there.

510
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,121
I thought if anybody
got that it'd be you.

511
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:47,678
What happened here?

512
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,598
The ethernet cable
still works.

513
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,416
Would you plug in
your tablet, please?

514
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:53,518
Did you decide to remodel?

515
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,519
Long story.

516
00:27:54,521 --> 00:27:55,553
Where's Dig?

517
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:57,221
Long story.

518
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:58,940
The hostage-taking junkie.

519
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:00,691
He is the only lead
to the Count we've got left.

520
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:02,477
What type of information
are you looking for?

521
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:05,980
Anything that will give us
a line on the Count's location.

522
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:08,366
Has the M.E. performed the
autopsy report yet?

523
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:10,284
Yeah, just
pulling it up now.

524
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:12,036
Check the toxicology
to see

525
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,871
if there's something related
to the Vertigo he was on.

526
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:15,439
He didn't die of
a Vertigo overdose.

527
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,492
I saw it, Felicity.

528
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:20,303
According to the
coroner, cause of death

529
00:28:20,328 --> 00:28:21,497
was severe anaphylaxis.

530
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:24,499
He died of an allergic reaction
to chlorpromazine.

531
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,083
That's an anti-psychotic.

532
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,053
Pull up the
Veronica Sparks autopsy.

533
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,490
Did she have chlorpromazine
in her system?

534
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:35,292
Yes.

535
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:36,978
How did you know?

536
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,563
The Count must have added it
as a new ingredient

537
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:40,581
in this latest iteration
of Vertigo.

538
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,152
But wouldn't the amount
he'd need

539
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:46,437
to manufacture enough
for circulation be huge?

540
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,272
Where would he
get that much?

541
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:51,943
A mental institution.

542
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:53,995
What if we're looking
at this all wrong?

543
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:55,312
How so?

544
00:28:55,314 --> 00:28:57,165
Everybody is looking
for him outside the asylum,

545
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,282
but what if he never left?

546
00:28:58,284 --> 00:28:59,534
What if...

547
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:02,620
What if he faked his escape

548
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:06,290
the same way that he
faked being insane?

549
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:57,008
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

550
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,260
Turn around.

551
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:04,348
I said turn around.

552
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:22,013
Yah!

553
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:42,721
Oliver Queen.

554
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:45,896
All those years
on that island.

555
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:13,221
So the Count didn't fake losing
his mind, did he?

556
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,906
This was you
the whole time.

557
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:19,076
How'd you get him to give you
the formula for Vertigo? Huh?

558
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:22,613
Chemistry doesn't seem
like his best subject right now.

559
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:25,265
He couldn't tell me
if he wanted to.

560
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,501
I ordered a biopsy
on his kidneys.

561
00:31:27,503 --> 00:31:31,255
The tissue was suffused
with the narcotic after his O.D.

562
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,941
When I got the results,
I realized I could

563
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:36,543
reverse engineer the chemical
compound of the drug,

564
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,512
produce a synthesized
version myself

565
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:40,497
using the facilities here.

566
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,299
And made a few
improvements,

567
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:43,500
like adding
chlorpromazine.

568
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,552
That's how
you found us.

569
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:48,071
Cops came around,
started asking questions,

570
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,326
you faked the Count's
disappearance to draw

571
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,887
attention away from yourself.

572
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:55,229
It's clever.

573
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:59,700
I wasn't trying to be
a criminal mastermind.

574
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:01,485
I just needed the money.

575
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:05,489
Something I'm sure a billionaire
wouldn't understand.

576
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,491
Believe me,

577
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,294
I understand you
perfectly.

578
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,529
Open his mouth.

579
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,998
What? No! No!

580
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:32,829
From what I've read
in the tabloids,

581
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,882
no one will be surprised
to hear Oliver Queen

582
00:32:35,884 --> 00:32:38,251
died of a drug overdose.

583
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,316
Uhh!

584
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:55,406
Clear.

585
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,897
Freeze!

586
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,637
You don't look so good.

587
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:09,806
I doubt you could aim
a single arrow.

588
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:49,280
Looks like I'm
the last one standing.

589
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:55,252
Sitting. Spinning.

590
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:58,622
Something to do.

591
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:01,242
What was I going to do?

592
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:04,428
Memory not what it
once was.

593
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,582
Nothing what it
once was.

594
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:18,709
Is there a name
on the gravestone?

595
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:22,930
No.

596
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:24,682
It's new.

597
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:27,985
And clean.

598
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:31,438
And waiting.

599
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:44,785
We're finished here.

600
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:56,544
Hey. How we doing?

601
00:35:56,546 --> 00:35:57,995
In the black.

602
00:35:57,997 --> 00:36:00,047
Did the Hood
get his man?

603
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:05,886
Well, we won't be having
any problems with Vertigo anymore.

604
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:07,838
Look, Tommy, I'm sorry.

605
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,323
I've caught up
the bookkeeping

606
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:12,226
and all my notes
on the inventory are in there,

607
00:36:12,228 --> 00:36:14,845
along with a list
of suppliers that we use.

608
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:17,464
Ok.

609
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,700
I don't see why
you're telling me that.

610
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:21,685
This club is
important to me.

611
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,904
But for you it's
just a front.

612
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:25,172
You want me to keep
your secret,

613
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:27,408
help you be this thing
you've become,

614
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,061
but you refuse to see me
for what I've become.

615
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:34,582
I've got just a bit
too much self-respect for that.

616
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,335
I quit.

617
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,913
Dinner.

618
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,448
You're still doing that?

619
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,100
Fyers better be careful
with his bowls of water.

620
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,138
When are we going to do
actual training?

621
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,224
There once was a young boy
whose father dropped him off

622
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:02,509
at a shaolin monastery
to study Kung Fu.

623
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,779
Good, a story.

624
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:07,398
After a year, the boy came
to visit his family.

625
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,233
When they asked what
he'd learned,

626
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:12,086
the boy hung his head
in shame.

627
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:16,073
All the monks had him do was
slap water in a barrel for a year.

628
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,691
We don't have a year.

629
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,578
So I hope your training
regimen is a bit faster.

630
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:26,033
The family didn't believe him,
so he showed them.

631
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:31,172
He raised his hand and hit
the table they were eating on.

632
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:32,323
It broke in half.

633
00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:34,175
I'm gonna be able
to break a table?

634
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:37,645
Better.

635
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:46,070
Ok.

636
00:37:57,415 --> 00:37:59,200
Draw the bow.

637
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:08,092
I'll be damned.

638
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:15,449
What's next?

639
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,351
We teach you to shoot.

640
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,271
Drinking alone?

641
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,957
Oh. Well, no,
not anymore.

642
00:38:44,162 --> 00:38:47,097
Just soda?

643
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,350
Bartender forget
the scotch?

644
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:52,720
I didn't really feel
the need for it.

645
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:57,925
So, um, the girl
who died,

646
00:38:57,927 --> 00:39:01,228
it turns out that she got
her Vertigo from a co-worker.

647
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,380
Guess I owe your
boyfriend an apology.

648
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,132
He has a name,
you know.

649
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,934
Yeah, I just can't
seem to bring myself to use it.

650
00:39:06,936 --> 00:39:08,402
Baby steps.

651
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:14,402
Did I screw things up
between us again?

652
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,444
No.

653
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,651
Look, I really wasn't
looking to jam up Merlyn, ok?

654
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,421
I knew by pursuing him
that I could throw a wrench in--

655
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:28,923
Then why did you do it?

656
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:30,457
There was evidence,
Laurel,

657
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:32,760
and I had to follow it.
I had to.

658
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:35,679
Look, your mom was
right, you were right.

659
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:37,081
Like you said about me
and the Vigilante,

660
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:39,022
I can't let things go.

661
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:42,770
I close cases,
it's what I do.

662
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:45,889
Everyone else be damned.

663
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:48,475
Well, maybe the fact that
there's no scotch in there means

664
00:39:48,477 --> 00:39:50,561
you're ready to work on that.

665
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,348
People can change.

666
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:03,407
Hey.

667
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:04,575
Hey.

668
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:09,096
You had my back.

669
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:11,849
You needed me.

670
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,968
Felicity told me
where you were headed.

671
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,370
You ok?

672
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,306
I'm the killer,
remember?

673
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:21,108
I've killed before,
Oliver.

674
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,010
It's just been a while.

675
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:29,800
If you're the killer,
why isn't the Count down, too?

676
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,770
I'm sure it must have been tempting
to take him off the board for good.

677
00:40:32,772 --> 00:40:34,405
People change.

678
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:35,773
People like
the Count?

679
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:40,244
No. I meant me.

680
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:43,530
Not so long ago I would have
put that guy down for good,

681
00:40:43,532 --> 00:40:48,619
but looking at him today
all vacant...

682
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:52,406
There didn't seem to be
a point.

683
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:58,078
But not everybody
deserves mercy.

684
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,631
For example.

685
00:41:04,486 --> 00:41:06,753
I thought he wasn't
a priority to you.

686
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,588
He's a priority
to you.

687
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:15,012
You two have
unfinished business.

688
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,930
Where do we start?

689
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,402
I'd prefer we skip
the I-told-you-sos,

690
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:26,290
but the nightclub wasn't
really working out.

691
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:30,878
I guess I need something
more boring, stable.

692
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,615
9:00 to 5:00, go home kiss Laurel,
that sort of thing.

693
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:42,289
I guess what
I'm saying is...

694
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,224
I want a job.

695
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:49,249
