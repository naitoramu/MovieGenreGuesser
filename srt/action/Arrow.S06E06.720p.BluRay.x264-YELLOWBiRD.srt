1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,334
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,252
I need you to help me find my son.

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,338
The men your son investigated,

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,008
when they discovered his arrest,
they broke into prison.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,256
Take him.
They are called the Jackals.

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,926
- You let my boy go.
- We need your son.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,599
After all, he's our boss.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,810
Hello, Father.

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,931
It's been a long time...

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,528
You should have stayed dead.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,276
I heard you were in trouble, kid.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,157
So I thought I'd offer my help.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,572
My old man.

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,529
Here to save me. Last I saw,

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,740
you weren't all that concerned
with saving anyone.

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,501
Apple doesn't fall that far.

17
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,046
What are you thinking?

18
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,418
- Patricide?
- He's seen our operation.

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,924
Makes him a liability.

20
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,801
Yeah, you can have that choice.

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,132
But I'll give you another one.

22
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,054
Let me join you.

23
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,890
If I wanted a family reunion,

24
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,642
I would have sent an invitation.

25
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,057
Maybe you did.

26
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,693
But you just haven't
realized it yet, kid.

27
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,571
See, I came all this way to
speak with you.

28
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,320
And I will kill anybody
who gets in my way

29
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,366
because I got nothing left to lose,
only you.

30
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,748
So go ahead.

31
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,454
And make a decision.

32
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,637
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
swayed by the poetry of it all.

33
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,799
But can I trust you?

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,892
Trust is built upon honesty.

35
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,392
I'm sure you have a lot
of questions to ask me.

36
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,729
And I have a lot of
questions for you, Joe.

37
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,355
That's not my name anymore.

38
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,900
Your mother named
you something different

39
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,903
to keep us apart.

40
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,282
Okay.

41
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,573
Guess we got some catching up to do.

42
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,184
I'm not leaving you.

43
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,859
Father.

44
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,033
Joe!

45
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,664
- How are you feeling?
- How did I get here?

46
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,830
Evac found you. Washed up
on the Philippine coast.

47
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,582
They said you were barely conscious.

48
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,089
Just muttering someone's name.

49
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,383
"Oliver." Who is he?

50
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,431
Father?

51
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,526
It's just someone that owed me a debt.

52
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,481
Everyone left you for dead.

53
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,400
But I knew you'd come back.

54
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,157
I won't ever leave you again, Joe.

55
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,582
I promise.

56
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,138
Wild Dog, Terrific.
You ready to do this?

57
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,019
<i>Always, but I got bad news.</i>

58
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,979
These guys aren't just thieves.

59
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,978
They killed a security guard.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,275
Make that two.

61
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,156
These guys aren't playing around.

62
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,323
Neither are we.

63
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,310
Incoming! Fall back!

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,481
Now!

65
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,905
Curtis, you're right. The thieves were
after the components of a 3D printer.

66
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,327
Two innocent people get killed

67
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,780
'cause some psycho
wants to print plastic toys?

68
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,287
This wasn't a consumer 3D printer.
This was military grade.

69
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,288
You're saying there's a printer
that can print weapons?

70
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,040
Or drones, or chemicals.

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,417
Sorry I missed the fun,
anyone want to catch me up?

72
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,794
Break-in, Cadmus Tech.

73
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:01,874
Thinking Cayden James?

74
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,459
That's what we were assuming,
but this crew

75
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,010
doesn't look like the type
he usually runs with.

76
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,588
That would track with some new street
chatter SCPD has been hearing lately.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,181
- What kind of chatter?
- New player.

78
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,931
No idea what his game is.
All we have is his street name.

79
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,433
- Dragon.
- Dragon?

80
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,431
- That's colorful.
- Tomorrow's problem.

81
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,771
Why don't we all get some rack time,
hit this fresh in the morning.

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,667
Excuse the poor accommodations.

83
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,417
Don't plan on staying in this stain
of a country too long.

84
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,175
Well, there's a reason why they say
the money is in the muck.

85
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,752
I did bring one luxury however.

86
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,299
Oh, there's a blast from the past.

87
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,062
My favorite. I never realized
you'd acquired a taste for it too.

88
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,814
Like you told me,
always drink good booze.

89
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,185
And only look out for yourself.

90
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,404
The Jackals are an unruly bunch.

91
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,568
Must've been hard trying to keep ASIS
in the dark for so long.

92
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,448
It's amazing what an agency overlooks

93
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,496
when it's willing to leave
its own men for dead.

94
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,918
So what kind of operation
are you planning on running here?

95
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,580
Drugs, weapons?

96
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,961
Perhaps a military coup.

97
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,007
Let's call it a re-assignment
of resources.

98
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,098
A lucrative one.

99
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,057
Hey, babe.

100
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,649
Hey.

101
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,649
I didn't wanna wake you.

102
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,905
I am still on Vlatava time.

103
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,002
Besides, I heard a rumor that the
Green Arrow was gonna be here.

104
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,296
And I'd never miss a chance to see him.

105
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,709
You know, when you took this on,

106
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,885
I think I got a pretty good sense

107
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,930
of how you felt when I took
Amanda Waller's place at A.R.G.U.S.

108
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,177
Not that bad, I hope.

109
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,226
But seeing you like this,

110
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,390
being the Green Arrow,

111
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,772
it suits you.

112
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,479
- Let's go to bed.
- Mmm.

113
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,239
Hey. Hey.

114
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,154
Let me clean up first.

115
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,531
Okay.

116
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,451
Don't be too long.

117
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,483
So, you and your boy,

118
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,905
one big happy family again, huh?

119
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,365
None of your business.

120
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,157
He told me about your new job,
the reassignment of resources.

121
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,249
Tell me about that.

122
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,328
The boss didn't think to tell you.

123
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,838
And that means it's none of your
business, comrade.

124
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,044
Main hall, 30 minutes.

125
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,042
Slade.

126
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,383
What are you doing here?

127
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,221
You should have gone home.

128
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,935
I don't abandon people.

129
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,180
Even when they leave me drugged.

130
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,106
Now, what is this reassignment
of resources

131
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,728
that your son and his men are planning?

132
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,026
You overheard that?

133
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,437
Just like I overheard your plan
to join his unit.

134
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,858
Your son is dangerous, Slade.

135
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,235
He's just a younger version of me.

136
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,990
No, you were never a gun for hire.

137
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,405
I was a killer.

138
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,540
Listen, kid, you better go home,

139
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,419
before you find yourself in trouble
you can't get out of.

140
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,254
I can't walk away from this.

141
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,124
Can you?

142
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,846
Feeling at home yet, Slade? Hmm?

143
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,265
Or should I call you Deathstroke?

144
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,896
Slight change in plans, gentlemen.

145
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,065
Forty percent of our Semtex
was compromised during transfer.

146
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,277
Conveniently, however, the Kasnian army
is doing some transferring of its own.

147
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,862
I'm gonna take a small team
to intercept.

148
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,622
Does this jeopardize our timeline?

149
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,916
Not with the infamous Deathstroke
backing me up.

150
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,911
What do you say, Father?

151
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,333
Interested in showing us how it's done?

152
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,464
As long as your dogs can keep up.

153
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,126
I'll go pack some gear.

154
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,856
- Hi, kid.
- Comms are working.

155
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,731
Kane has me making a run
for Semtex.

156
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,278
<i>That's a high-yield explosive.</i>

157
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,985
With Nylander involved I should've
expected it.

158
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,067
Well, he'll probably be handling
the detonator.

159
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,903
If you can find the receiver,
perhaps you can corrupt it.

160
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,655
<i>- It might be in Nylander's gear.</i>
- I'm on it.

161
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,698
You good?

162
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,329
Just find the receiver.

163
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,799
Keep varying your pace.

164
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,251
My pace is fine, old man.

165
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,596
So you say.

166
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,678
Dead.

167
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,263
Come on, get up.

168
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,431
How are you better with one eye
than I am with two?

169
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,608
You must learn to move with your mind.

170
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:53,809
Not your eyes.

171
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,269
Come on.

172
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,603
Let's go again.

173
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,855
Hold on a second.

174
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,579
Here, happy one year back
from the dead day.

175
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,502
- Don't look too excited.
- I can't believe it's been so long.

176
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,090
Thank you.

177
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,930
You might change your mind about
staying home after you see this.

178
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,432
New prototype.
Should be ready in a year.

179
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,898
That's gotta be tempting, right?

180
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,858
Not in the slightest.
Enough distractions.

181
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,651
Let's train.

182
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,533
Come on.

183
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,178
Come on!

184
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,425
Yes.

185
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,473
Damn it, Father.

186
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,481
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,107
I think we're done with training today.

188
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,819
You tried to forget me.

189
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,576
Shado!

190
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,468
But you can't, my love.

191
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,588
Because you made me a promise.

192
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,484
You want more drugs?
You got to talk to the boss.

193
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,109
All right, man, make the introduction.

194
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,032
Who the hell is this?

195
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,666
- The loyal customer.
- This the guy you told me about?

196
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,712
Ricardo Diaz. So, you're a bouncer?

197
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,792
- Something like that, right?
- That's right.

198
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,378
You're huge.

199
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,342
I wouldn't want to mess with you.

200
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,225
I'm just playing with you.

201
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,145
Till we get our FDA approval,
we got to be careful

202
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,648
- with the roll-out. You understand?
- I get it.

203
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,312
Just trying to make it through a day.

204
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,522
Aren't we all?

205
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,655
- Hook him up.
- Sure thing, Mr. Diaz.

206
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,252
I always knew you'd end up wearing this.

207
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,261
Kill the lights.

208
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,863
We don't leave witnesses.

209
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:34,965
Hey!

210
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,092
Anybody in the mood to stress eat?

211
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,176
Always, what you got?

212
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,433
Quadruple cheese! Must be serious.

213
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,721
What's going on here?

214
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,227
Trying to get a line on this Dragon guy,

215
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,774
find out what he and his crew are up to.

216
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,278
At least we know where they are.
Just got a security alert.

217
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,480
Palmer Tech Bio Division.

218
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,065
Suit up and stay sharp.

219
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,276
Remember, these guys
aren't afraid of dropping bodies.

220
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,743
We got company! Go!

221
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,374
I've got the SUV, cover me.

222
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,368
You okay, hoss?

223
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,958
I ran facial recognition off of
John's body cam footage.

224
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,591
Meet Ricardo Diaz and his extensive
criminal record.

225
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,672
Does anyone want to guess
what his street name is?

226
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,807
Anyone want to guess?

227
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,310
You guys are no fun.
His street name is Dragon.

228
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,309
This jerk wad's been out of
prison less than a month.

229
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,934
He's really racked up a body count.

230
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,017
This guy was doing double jolts
of life plus one.

231
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,692
- What's that?
- It's life without parole.

232
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,103
What's he doing walking around?

233
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,689
State Supreme court overturned
his convictions due to technicalities.

234
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,775
But before he was on the inside,
he was running with a group called

235
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,234
the Scorpions in the Glades.

236
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,824
John, do you know anything
about the Scorpions?

237
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,867
John?

238
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,245
John, John, Earth to John Diggle.
The Scorpions?

239
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,502
The Scorpions, yeah, I know them.

240
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,002
But Diaz is on something different.
New muscle, new crew. Way too organized.

241
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,833
Wonder when he got himself
a new crew.

242
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,463
How he got to be the boss of it.

243
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,754
Why he needs a weapons grade 3D printer.

244
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,423
I think I have the answer to that.

245
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,933
Drugs. High-end ones.

246
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,726
I cross-referenced
the two models that were stolen

247
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,430
and what they have in common is
their capacity to simultaneously print

248
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,937
inert polypropylenes
and soft material catalyst composites.

249
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,734
Did anyone understand a word of that?

250
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,528
You think Diaz is making reactionware?

251
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,690
- Anyone normal.
- With this equipment?

252
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,742
- Diaz cuts out the middle man.
- He can make designer drugs

253
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,241
more cheaply and efficiently
than anyone else on the street.

254
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,162
Yeah, well, the hell he is.
Whatever science experiment

255
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,911
he's got going on,
we're shutting it down.

256
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,414
Curtis, let's work up a location
for Diaz's operation.

257
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,493
Mmm-hmm.

258
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,792
- You okay, chief?
- Yeah.

259
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,796
Been a while since a perp got
the drop on me. That's all.

260
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,464
We'll make sure Diaz pays for that.

261
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,727
So what are you planning
with all these explosives?

262
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,182
I'd like to know.

263
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,477
You missed your kill shot with
the soldier back there.

264
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,780
Well, when I lost this eye,
I lost my depth perception.

265
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,158
Most of my men think
you joined me under false pretenses.

266
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,992
There's nothing false about
trying to find my son.

267
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,789
But if they doubt me...

268
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,453
Then maybe I don't have your trust.

269
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,079
Of course, you do.

270
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,961
That's why I got you a little gift.

271
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,803
You told me not to worry, brother.

272
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,807
Nylander found him
with my detonator.

273
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,564
Some might see this as coincidence.
But I see it as fate.

274
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,519
It's time to collect on that debt
he owes your father.

275
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,358
Oliver Queen! I've waited a very,

276
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,409
very long time for this.

277
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,784
An eye for an eye.

278
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,841
You're lying to yourself, Slade.

279
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,886
You know he's alive.

280
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,047
You've always known.

281
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,803
But still you do nothing.

282
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,268
You know what he did to me.

283
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,059
You know what he took from us.

284
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,518
Yet here you are, hiding like a coward.

285
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,062
Getting weak.

286
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,355
Pathetic.

287
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,526
Give me what you promised.

288
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,119
Give me what you promised.

289
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,655
Get out of my head!

290
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,960
Not until Oliver Queen is dead.

291
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:21,461
He is dead. He died on the <i>Amazo.</i>

292
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,057
<i>Oliver Queen is alive.</i>

293
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,556
<i>The Starling City resident
was found by fishermen</i>

294
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,978
<i>in the North China Sea five days ago.</i>

295
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,267
Listen, love,

296
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,312
you're the only one who can avenge me.

297
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,696
You're the only one
who can make him suffer.

298
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,737
You know why?

299
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,862
I keep my promises.

300
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,094
Sir, is everything okay?

301
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,645
Come on!

302
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,943
You are telling me
you became the Green Arrow

303
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,324
after you knew about the tremor?

304
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,450
I was gonna tell Oliver.

305
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,370
But then he asked me to take over
for him. I couldn't let him down.

306
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,712
- I couldn't let the team down.
- But you were physically compromised.

307
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,414
I came up with a temporary solution.

308
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,340
An experimental steroid.

309
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,052
Lyla, I wanted to tell you so bad,
I know it was the wrong call.

310
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,965
- I'm sorry.
- I'm just glad you finally told me.

311
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,675
But now that I have, I need your help.

312
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,009
Is there anything,

313
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,642
anything that A.R.G.U.S. is working
on that could help my condition?

314
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,437
I thought it was just
some kind of steroid.

315
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,318
Yeah, we found out that
the manufacturer's involved in

316
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,730
criminal activity.

317
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,616
He and his crew have killed
at least two people.

318
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:09,947
I don't know, maybe more.

319
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:14,156
Right, so your experimental steroid
is actually an illegal drug.

320
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,206
Look, if this is what it's taken
for you to come clean,

321
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,164
and get this guy off of the street,
then I guess I should be grateful.

322
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,333
What?

323
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,631
You're still using the drug.

324
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,597
And I guess that means that
the drug dealer is out there too.

325
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,807
To be Green Arrow means
I have to be physically capable

326
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,638
of protecting the city, no matter what.

327
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,272
Lyla, you make the same choices
at A.R.G.U.S. all the time.

328
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,852
Choices you've condemned me for making.

329
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,108
I know I'm wrong, but I couldn't
let Oliver down.

330
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,527
So you let yourself down instead.

331
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,527
Johnny, you are the most
moral man I know.

332
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,159
I can't even begin to fathom
how you could do this.

333
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,208
As soon as A.R.G.U.S. has a solution,
I'll get my guy off the street.

334
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,786
Until then, how many more people
is this guy going to kill?

335
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,463
It's not that simple.
It's not that simple.

336
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,165
You're the one
who taught me that it is.

337
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,127
Lyla, can we please...

338
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,133
No, I just... I want to be alone
right now.

339
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,695
Years ago, I made you a promise.

340
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,400
Do you remember?

341
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,740
I promised that you would suffer

342
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,828
the same way that I suffered.

343
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,784
What are you doing?

344
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,208
You are not this person anymore.

345
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:45,205
What I am is a father

346
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,257
reunited with my son.

347
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,010
I made him a promise too.

348
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,464
And I'm not going to break it again.

349
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,594
We made each other a promise, Slade.

350
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,594
To save our sons.

351
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,103
To save Joe, to save William.

352
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,687
He has a son.

353
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,943
I'll make sure he suffers too.

354
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,460
Slade.

355
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,622
Do it.

356
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,706
Slade!

357
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,502
Slade!

358
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,221
That was a little too convincing.

359
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,639
We gotta go.

360
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:45,974
Come on.

361
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,205
- There's no way out.
- Let's make our own way. Come on.

362
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,258
I'll send out the dogs.

363
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,847
We've got the op.

364
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,390
That's where they'll be.

365
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,052
You sure?

366
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,972
That my father would try
to stop us?

367
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,648
That's what fathers do.

368
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,310
And that's why I'm gonna kill him.

369
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,950
Before they captured me,
I saw what Kane was going after.

370
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,623
Attacking the water supply, it's a
death sentence for half the country.

371
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,618
If we move now, we might
be able to stop them.

372
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,332
If that's what you want.

373
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,337
I spared your life back there.

374
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,297
I know.

375
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,384
Back there, it didn't feel like an act

376
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,471
the same way it did with Chase
back on Lian Yu.

377
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,351
Because when I saw my son,

378
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,066
I was tempted.

379
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,820
I would have done anything
to keep us together.

380
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,572
But when you mentioned William,

381
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,199
I realized that's not my boy.

382
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,697
It's Kane.

383
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,535
And what I fear is there's
only one way to stop him.

384
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,369
Slade.

385
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,966
There are other ways to deal with this
that don't involve killing your son.

386
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,920
Deep down, he's your boy
so you have to reason with him.

387
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,096
And I swear, he will listen to you.

388
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,846
But I didn't tell you what happened
after Lian Yu.

389
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,517
I went home to my son and I promised him

390
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,223
I would stay and never leave.

391
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,108
And I broke that promise.

392
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,436
You broke the promise
because of the Mirakuru.

393
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,317
The Mirakuru faded for a while.

394
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,611
But when it came back,
it was like a storm

395
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,032
I could not control.

396
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:05,455
And that monster is what my son
is trying to emulate.

397
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,247
But it's not Mirakuru with Joe.
It's anger and resentment.

398
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,876
And I don't know
how that can be redeemed.

399
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,378
Well, I didn't think that
you could be redeemed.

400
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,510
But I'm here, miles from home,

401
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,132
miles from my son,

402
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,298
trying to help you save yours.

403
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,260
And I can do that because I knew
the man that you were

404
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,719
before the Mirakuru.

405
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,647
That is who your son needs to see.
He needs to see his father.

406
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,645
The man you are right now, tonight.

407
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,204
Father?

408
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,680
Drop your weapon.

409
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,104
No. Not until you tell me
what you're doing.

410
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,980
They were trying to stop me.

411
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,523
What the hell are you talking about?

412
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,560
Stop you from what?

413
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,524
Keeping my promise.

414
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,749
Stay out of my way.

415
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,886
He doesn't show up on traffic cams.
He doesn't leave a paper trail.

416
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,262
Ricardo Diaz is good.

417
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,640
How's the research on
his old associates going?

418
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,892
Going lousy. Everybody mentioned
in his arrest records

419
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,189
is either missing or dead.

420
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,102
Explains why no one's willing to talk
to the department about Dragon.

421
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,110
I've got something.

422
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,814
Diaz's address. His base of operations.

423
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,149
How the hell did you get that?

424
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,405
It's a contact. That's all I can say.

425
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,485
Got it.

426
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,575
Thermal imaging shows a lot
of activity inside.

427
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,872
Got to figure Diaz is in there.

428
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,371
Even if he's not, we can
still disrupt his drug operation.

429
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,123
Let's take this guy down.

430
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,496
Suit up.

431
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,816
Green Arrow has found us,
and his friends too.

432
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,144
Clear out our stash.

433
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,442
Nothing gets confiscated.

434
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,114
Go, go!

435
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,749
Stop!

436
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,216
We gotta move!

437
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,929
Arrow, let's go.

438
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,202
Arrow, let's go!

439
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,433
- Where are we?
- All charges are set.

440
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,183
- Looks like it should be you.
- I hired you to pull the trigger.

441
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,236
Move out! Get to a safe distance.

442
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,647
Semtex makes for a pretty big bang.

443
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,945
- You're not coming with?
- I want a good view.

444
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,485
You're crazy. I love it.

445
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,279
Don't forget what you said
about the Semtex.

446
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,411
I knew you'd show up.

447
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,459
I think it's time we had ourselves
an honest talk.

448
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,728
Trust begins with honesty.

449
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,273
That's what you said to me.
But you lied.

450
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,067
You know life is not that simple, Joe.

451
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,822
That's not my name.

452
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,027
How could you forgive Oliver Queen
after what he did to you?

453
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,696
Because he forgave me for far worse.

454
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,956
Sins that I have to carry to the grave.

455
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,080
A curse I didn't want to pass on to you.

456
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,912
All of this anger and resentment.

457
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,248
It's time to bring it to an end, son.

458
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,332
No.

459
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,002
This is just the beginning.

460
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,374
You used to be ruthless. What happened?

461
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,289
What you saw was the Mirakuru.

462
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,419
Stop lying!

463
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,756
I saw you kill before the Mirakuru.

464
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,427
Milford Sound.

465
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,553
That little father-son trip.

466
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,351
The one you promised

467
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,020
would be all about you and me.

468
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,319
I saw what you did to that Chinese spy.

469
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,412
I was on a mission for ASIS.

470
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,073
Well, here's something you don't know.

471
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,791
Something Mother never told you.

472
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,077
I have a brother.

473
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,213
His name is Grant.

474
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,420
Mother didn't want him in this world.

475
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,417
But me,

476
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,628
I'm my father's son.

477
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,382
I made my first kill six months
after our camping trip.

478
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,092
I slit his throat,

479
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,015
just like you did.

480
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,976
I wanted to be exactly like my father.

481
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,066
Like Deathstroke.

482
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,159
I'm not Deathstroke

483
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:04,949
anymore.

484
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,499
Then you're not my father anymore.

485
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,373
You're just in my way.

486
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,428
Don't move. Slade, you all right?

487
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,881
Oliver, lower your gun.

488
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,227
I wish that you'd stayed dead.

489
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,023
He's gone.

490
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,870
Thank you.

491
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,838
Spoke with our friend, the Warden.

492
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,588
Jackals are in custody,
and he is very relieved.

493
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,047
You all right?

494
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,841
My son.

495
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,394
He saw me kill a man
before the Mirakuru.

496
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,188
Before Deathstroke.

497
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,515
He followed in my path, Oliver.

498
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,603
No. Don't blame yourself, Slade,
it doesn't help.

499
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,903
You know why I do.

500
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,272
Never give up on family.

501
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,820
That's what you told me.

502
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,993
It's time for you to go home.

503
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,404
Where will you go?

504
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,457
I'm gonna keep searching for my son.

505
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,039
Both of them.

506
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,965
- I can't give up.
- You ever need my help again,

507
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,388
you don't hesitate to ask.

508
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,261
You have your own son to protect.

509
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,225
I'm not gonna put that at risk again.

510
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,977
You've seen what can happen.

511
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:56,985
Thank you, kid.

512
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,467
Hey.

513
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,307
I just saw a news report
on the lab explosion.

514
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,718
Looks like you took down his operation.

515
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,062
With plenty of collateral damage.

516
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,730
Yeah, well, that part was all Diaz.

517
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,441
He was willing to blow up the works.

518
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,644
Kill all of his men.

519
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,773
So, you didn't mean to
destroy the drugs?

520
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,490
Uh...

521
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,615
I planned to take
as much as I could carry.

522
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,828
When I realized I was losing
the very thing

523
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,533
that allowed me to put on
that hood,

524
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,084
I wanted to run straight into
the explosion.

525
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,247
Johnny.

526
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,048
I was a hypocrite and I am sorry.

527
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,750
I'm sorry.

528
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,047
Don't be sorry.

529
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,006
Be safe.

530
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,134
Be okay.

531
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,760
I'll try.

532
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,857
Hey!

533
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,476
Come here, you.

534
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,440
I missed you.

535
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:25,987
I missed you, Daddy.

536
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,291
I have, uh, one more stop tonight
with some other people,

537
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,341
deserve an apology,

538
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,461
an explanation.

539
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,422
Okay.

540
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,811
- I'm going to win.
- No! I almost got you.

541
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,019
- Yes! Yes!
- No!

542
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,063
Rematch? Rematch.

543
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,114
- All right.
- I got you on this one.

544
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,533
- Hey.
- Hey.

545
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,234
Hey, buddy.

546
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,236
Come here.

547
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,082
- Okay. You weren't gone that long.
- I know. I know.

548
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,620
Well, I'm happy to see you,
it's allowed.

549
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,416
So, what happened with your friend?

550
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,836
He found his son.

551
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,668
- That's good.
- So what did I miss?

552
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,754
Well, Raisa made me clean my room.

553
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,839
Felice and I ate
ice cream for dinner.

554
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,552
And I got an A on my science project.

555
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,633
You got an A?

556
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,343
- Yeah.
- That's fantastic.

557
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,353
- Is it here, can I see it?
- Yeah, sure.

558
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,482
It's a bottle rocket, went 300 feet,
farthest in the whole school.

559
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,274
- Unbelievable. All right.
- I'll go get it.

560
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,440
Pretty cool!

561
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:48,032
I hope you don't mind that I'm here.
William said that he was kind of

562
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,154
getting sick of Raisa,
and the ice cream for dinner,

563
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,862
it was Rocky Road, so technically
the nut should count as protein.

564
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,326
- I'm so happy you're here.
- Me too.

565
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,827
Slade got his happy ending?

566
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,791
Not like that.

567
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,251
It's a long story.

568
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,629
It's a sad story.

569
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,126
Sensing a but.

570
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,211
I learned something.

571
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,095
I made the right decision
to not be the Green Arrow.

572
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,806
- For William and for me.
- Good.

573
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,353
If we can go up to the roof,
I can show you how it works.

574
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,810
- Yup.
- Yes.

575
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,585
The moment I hesitated,
even as the flames grew closer,

576
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,582
that was my rock bottom.

577
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,507
I should have told you all about
the tremor from the beginning.

578
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,631
- I'm truly sorry I didn't.
- So you're saying

579
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,385
the tremor started before
Black Siren showed her face

580
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,810
- in Star City?
- Yes.

581
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,108
And that's why, Rene, I owe you
the biggest apology of all.

582
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:07,649
You should've known what was going on
before we ever got to that bridge, man.

583
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,814
My pride almost got you killed.

584
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:11,607
I betrayed your trust.

585
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,700
Put your lives in danger.

586
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,162
All I can ask is that you forgive me,
but I understand if you can't.

587
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,331
Getting shot wasn't great.

588
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,909
But if I'm counting the times
you saved my life

589
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,710
against the times you almost
got me killed,

590
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:25,962
you're still ahead.

591
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,425
I, for one, am incredibly offended.

592
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,218
And you have every right to be, Curtis.

593
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,672
That you didn't come to me first
for help treating you.

594
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,557
I created a chip to help
a woman walk, people.

595
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,885
He's got a point, John.

596
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,352
Might be time to outsource
this little problem.

597
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,263
Yeah.

598
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,556
Yeah.

599
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,641
Outstanding.

600
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,147
So have you already had
an electromyogram?

601
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,274
Wait, what am I talking about? We need
to start off with an NCV test first.

602
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,028
Curtis, it's been a long night.

603
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,985
Is there any way we can do this
in the morning?

604
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,069
Sure thing.

605
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,321
It would be my honor.

606
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,624
- It would be my pleasure.
- Kiss-ass.

607
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,751
What the... I'm trying to...

608
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,508
You waiting on a special apology?
Because you deserve one.

609
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,004
No.

610
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,723
Just wanted to make sure you're okay.

611
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,346
- Really?
- Really.

612
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,144
Well, I'm gonna give you one anyway.

613
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,893
Dinah, I lied to you and I'm sorry,

614
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,432
but I'll make one more promise.

615
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,438
There'll be no more secrets
between you and me.

616
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:30,982
No more secrets.
