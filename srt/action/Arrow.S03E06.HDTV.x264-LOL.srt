1
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:03,816
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:05,354
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:07,790
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:09,971
to save my city.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,441
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:15,484
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,083
To the rest
of Starling City,

8
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,918
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,521
I am something else.

10
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,690
Previously, on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,192
My sister. She was murdered,
and I can't tell anyone.

12
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,695
See, before, Laurel, you were swinging
at your sister's killer.

13
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,297
Don't train for that. All
right, train for yourself.

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,833
Oliver: The serum that
you were exposed to,

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,669
it changes your body
but it also warps your mind.

16
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,237
You're not moving
very quickly this morning.

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,739
I just didn't sleep
much last night.

18
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:46,044
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,356
Oliver: Roy!

20
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,558
Where'd you go?

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,859
Sorry.

22
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,627
Get your head
in the game.

23
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,529
We're in position.

24
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,566
So is the Culebra cartel
and their gajillion pounds of heroin.

25
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,434
They all showed up
about 30 minutes ago

26
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,236
and they haven't moved
from your location.

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,571
Oliver:
Got it.

28
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,473
No sentries
outside.

29
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,708
If we're going to do this,
we need to do it now.

30
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,443
I've got north entrance,
Dig's got south.

31
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,778
- Roy...
- East.

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,446
The roof.

33
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,215
You're on
over watch.

34
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,117
The Culebras get their weapons
from the Bratva.

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,219
All military grade.

36
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,620
I've got your backs.

37
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,789
Let's do this.

38
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,926
South is clear.

39
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,596
Nobody's home.

40
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,201
Roof's clear.

41
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,040
North is empty, too.

42
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,307
That doesn't make sense.
They all showed up

43
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,709
half an hour ago
and never left.

44
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,011
They are in there somewhere.
[Beep]

45
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,894
Looks like somebody
beat us here.

46
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,563
There's at least a few million dollars
worth of heroin.

47
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,473
[Speaking Spanish]

48
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,309
He took Paco.

49
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,113
Whoever did this
ignored the drugs,

50
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,182
took a gang member.

51
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,884
This was personal.

52
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,087
Yeah, more than that.

53
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,589
Whoever did this was
trying to send a message.

54
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,960
I think I know
what it is.

55

57

Guilty. Well, yeah.

58
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,180
The Culebras are the bloodiest
gang in Starling.

59
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,982
Who's the second bloodiest?

60
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,884
Culebras have a long standing rivalry
with the Los Halcones.

61
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,552
Thought you said this was
personal, not business.

62
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,854
And Paco?

63
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,456
There are only 86,000
Pacos in Starling,

64
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,058
give or take 5,000
for a few nicknames.

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,726
Something tells me
that the Culebra's

66
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,262
long standing rivals will
narrow that down for us.

67
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,698
You know, when we find Paco,
he'll be too dead to say anything.

68
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,167
I'm not looking for him.
I'm looking for whoever did this.

69
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,720
I will handle this.
Take the rest of the night.

70
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:26,677
I'll back you up.

71
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,206
Not dead on your feet,
you won't.

72
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,675
I'm sorry. I know I've been a little
out of it recently.

73
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,677
Don't be sorry.
Be rested.

74
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,479
I wouldn't be
much of a teacher

75
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,850
if I let you get killed because
your reaction time is slow, ok?

76
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,587
Dig.

77
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,323
There are a lot of Halcones
members in Starling City.

78
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,026
How about I take
the ones north of Tenth Street.

79
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,502
Oliver: You know,
we've been waiting here an hour.

80
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,739
After walking around
the block five times.

81
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,074
We need to work
on your patience.

82
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,710
Where is this guy?
And more importantly,

83
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,946
how is he going to help us
find out what this...

84
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,881
China White person is--

85
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,150
- Chien Na Wei.
- Whatever!

86
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,153
How is he going to help us find out what
she's doing in Hong Kong?

87
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,389
Waller hasn't been
able to locate Chien Na Wei

88
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,725
because she avoids using any traceable
forms of communication.

89
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,294
So he's the target now?

90
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,362
He's her delivery guy.

91
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,364
Her courier. But
he's not a target.

92
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,832
Waller doesn't want
you to kill him.

93
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,702
That's refreshing.

94
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,671
They'll use
a dead drop.

95
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,073
Leave behind information
for Chien's network.

96
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,441
Information
Waller intercepts.

97
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,876
I see him.

98
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,050
Stay on Bluetooth.

99
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,819
I'll be right
behind you.

100
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,859
- Ahh!
- What was that?

101
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,428
Did he make you?

102
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,930
Yeah, I think he did.

103
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,915
He's gone.
Where is it?

104
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,683
- Where's what?
- The envelope.

105
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,619
The message.
We need it!

106
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,088
He must have stashed it somewhere
while you were chasing him.

107
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,723
I didn't see him
stash anything!

108
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,126
Yes, you did.
You just don't know it yet.

109
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,031
That's not bad.

110
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,733
Yeah. It's better than "not bad".

111
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,875
What the hell
was that?!

112
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,677
Today's lesson.
Fighting's about

113
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,047
being surprised and not getting rattled.
You look rattled.

114
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,582
Try angry.

115
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,617
Another lesson, then.

116
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,753
It's not about you
getting knocked to the mat.

117
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,454
It's if you get up.

118
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,858
Okay, fine.
Then let's go again.

119
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,694
Not tonight.
All right?

120
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,729
I got to
close up shop.

121
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,132
And you need to
get some rest.

122
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,701
Let those
muscles recover.

123
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,803
Make sure you get some protein
within the hour, all right?

124
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,539
Yeah, egg whites.
They're my new BFF.

125
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,675
Oh, that's disgusting.

126
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,044
No, no, no,
two blocks from here--

127
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,345
Korean tacos.

128
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,380
- Korean tacos?
- Trust me.

129
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,583
They're heaven.
Come on, I'm buying.

130
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,753
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

131
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,188
You just did.

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,856
Kidding. What?

133
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,658
You know how to do
a blood test, right?

134
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,094
I know just enough
to make me dangerous.

135
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,862
And, well,
me holding a syringe,

136
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,898
well, that makes me
more dangerous.

137
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,533
Why?

138
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,168
I need you
to test my blood.

139
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,704
For what?
And don't say STDs,

140
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,806
because that would
be crossing a line.

141
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,974
For Mirakuru.

142
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,910
I don't need to check you for
traces of Mirakuru.

143
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,545
You were cured.

144
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,879
I know, I--

145
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,748
If this is about
your sleep problems,

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,078
Mirakuru makes people
crazy strong and crazy crazy.

147
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,014
It doesn't make it hard
for them to get 8 hours.

148
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:03,100
Could you just...

149
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:04,934
Are you ok?

150
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:08,138
I mean, besides the whole
not sleeping thing.

151
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,908
Totally.
I'm fine.

152
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,311
I'm just looking for reasons to help
me sleep, you know?

153
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:16,746
Ok.

154
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,759
I'm looking for a crew member
named Paco.

155
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:31,428
- Emilio?
- Paco!

156
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,929
That's what
they call him, ese!

157
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,931
- Paco's his street name!
- Who?!

158
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,666
Emilio.

159
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,768
Emilio Ortega.

160
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,904
Thank you.

161
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:43,940
Felicity, I have a name.

162
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:46,276
Emilio Ortega.

163
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:48,478
Pinging his cell's GPS.

164
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,314
He's in the Glades.

165
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:52,882
Ninth and Hasen.

166
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:25,831
Why'd you kill
all those men?

167
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,632
What the hell are
you talking about?

168
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:28,833
What are you doing?!

169
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,067
Get out of here.

170
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,737
Oh, my God.

171
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:33,871
Now, Laurel!

172
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:35,473
No!

173
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:38,943
Ted didn't do this.
Ted's been with me

174
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:41,145
for the past two hours.
He trained with me,

175
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,014
and then we went for dinner.

176
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:44,849
And that...

177
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,385
He wasn't here when we left.

178
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,361
Ok, that is ten minutes of my life
I am never getting back.

Ahh, thank God.

Ok, you're acting like
I just told you

185
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,842
that the biopsy
came back negative.

186
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,544
What is going on?

187
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,646
It's--it's stupid.

188
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,515
You just had me
test your blood

189
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:19,717
for a serum you were
cured of six months ago.

190
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,686
I already knew it was stupid.

191
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:24,255
The reason I haven't
been sleeping

192
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,958
is 'cause I've been
having dreams,

193
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,160
and not normal ones.

194
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:31,762
It was like I was remembering
the time I was out,

195
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:33,097
you know?

196
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,299
When Slade ODed me
on the Mirakuru.

197
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:36,667
What do you remember?

198
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:40,338
Nothing much.
Just a feeling.

199
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,808
A feeling
of being...

200
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,910
not me.

201
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:49,647
And being strong
and out of control,

202
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,283
but here's the thing--

203
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:55,219
in those dreams...

204
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,622
I killed Sara.

205
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:01,659
This really had you worried?

206
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:04,762
Because the dreams,
they didn't feel like dreams, Felicity.

207
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,864
They felt like memories.

208
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:11,302
I actually remembered
throwing arrows into her.

209
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:13,004
Crazy, right?

Crazy.

So that's it?

214
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:25,149
I was with him
the whole time.

215
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,651
You can put me on the box
if you'd like.

216
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:29,787
If I wanted to give my
daughter a polygraph,

217
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,822
I'd have done it back when you
discovered beer.

218
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:34,859
So listen,
what's the story

219
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:36,594
with you and this guy,
anyway?

220
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,229
He's just my trainer.

221
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:40,798
- Who you went to dinner with?
- As friends.

222
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,967
But I know him, and he would never
do something like this.

223
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,602
Well, we've got
to hold him here

224
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,137
till the coroner's
official findings come back,

225
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,438
and then if they're
consistent with his story,

226
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,607
we'll cut him loose.

227

He didn't do it.

230
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,462
Why would a mass murderer

231
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,097
string up a body in his gym?

232
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:14,932
Ted caters to a pretty
rough clientele.

He runs afoul of one
every now and again.

236
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,841
He thinks someone
was trying to send him a message.

237
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:26,177
- Who?
- He says he doesn't know.

238
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,878
I want to talk to him.

239

About this case, or me?

240
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:33,150
Two weeks ago, I said
I wouldn't train you to fight.

241
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,186
Now you have a trainer.

242
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:38,289
Who's training me
to box, to let off some steam.

243
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,958
I think I have a pretty good reason
to have some.

244

Keep your eyes open
with this guy.

245

He didn't do this.

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,197
Just the same.

Because I need
to remember something.

00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,934
But this was hung
around the body

324
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:47,569
that was found in my gym.

325
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,304
The key is
to the storage locker.

326
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,473
He's leaving me
a trail to follow.

327
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:53,275
Who is?

328
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:55,744
Whoever's setting me up.

329
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:57,946
Look, I've never
killed anyone.

330
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:02,351
Except for that drug dealer that
you beat to death six years ago.

331
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:05,153
That was a mistake.

332
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,855
I may have avoided jail,
but I have lived

333
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,323
with the guilt
of that man's death

334
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,925
every single day
of my life.

335
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,227
I gave it all up
after that.

336
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:15,931
I locked this place up
and I swore I'd never open it again.

337
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,567
Who else knows
about the locker?

338
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,202
No one.

339
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,803
This is where
I kept my supplies.

340
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,839
A safe place separate
from my day job.

341
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,574
I'm sure you've got
one just like it.

342
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,042
Mine's bigger.

343
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:28,844
Look, we're both
trying to find out

344
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:30,646
who the hell's
doing this.

345
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:32,047
We could help
each other.

346
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,917
Laurel: His name
is Albert Mancini.

347
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,487
No criminal record, aside from a few
unpaid parking tickets.

348
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,289
Grant says he doesn't
know who this guy is.

349
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,624
- Oh, and now you believe him?
- I haven't decided yet!

350
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,860
Do you know that you're training
with a vigilante?

351
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:47,629
Former, apparently.
And no, I didn't.

352
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,831
- I didn't!
- So you also didn't know

353
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,868
that six years ago, he beat
someone to death?

354
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,404
How many more reasons

355
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,672
am I going to have
to give you

356
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,941
before you stay away
from this guy?

357
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:01,310
Ok, you know what,
are you guys just about finished

358
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,445
with your little
private chat?

359
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,714
The guy from your storage unit,

360
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,316
he has no criminal record.

361
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:09,985
He was a magician.
Magician's assistant,

362
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:11,920
more accurately.
He worked with a local act

363
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:13,722
before getting cut loose.

364
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,424
Mancini hasn't worked since.

365
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:17,626
Culebra cartel,
magician's assistant.

366
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:18,994
What's the connection?

367
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:22,064
Their act was
at the Sansa bar.

368
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:25,233
The Sansa bar's where's the drug
dealer was murdered.

369
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:26,768
You mean the person
you beat to death?

370
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,403
I told you--

371
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:30,939
whoever's doing this
is leaving me a trail to follow.

372
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:32,140
Then we follow it.

373
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:33,342
We need another minute.

374
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,477
How do you two
know each other?

375
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,881
We used to date.

376
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,355
You cannot be serious.

377
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:48,023
I am not on your team.

378
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:50,492
- I don't work for you.
- Exactly. You're untrained.

379
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:51,793
Oh, who's fault is that?

380
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,328
[Exhales]

381
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,731
Does he know?

382
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,933
What's driving you?

383
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,669
I told him...

384
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:02,237
That Sara's gone.

385
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,805
But does he know

386
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,708
that you want to follow
in her footsteps?

387
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,177
You're playing a very
dangerous game, Laurel.

388
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,013
I can handle it.

389
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,614
No, you can't.

390
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,250
Because you haven't realized

391
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:18,920
that it's not actually a game.

392
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:21,923
Let's go.

393
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:22,991
What about Laurel?

394
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:24,826
She's not coming.

395
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,135
Oliver has a 20
on our killer.

396
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,970
I thought Oliver
was tracking Grant.

397
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:36,238
Looks like things
have changed.

398
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,073
Suit up, he wants us
to provide back-up.

399
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,275
- Roy can't go.
- What?

400
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:41,677
I need to talk to you about
something important.

401
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,179
- It can wait.
- No, it can't. John?

402
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,182
I'll take care of it.

403
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:48,617
What the hell is that about?

404
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:49,785
We need to talk.

405
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:51,620
Yeah, you made that
pretty clear.

406
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,588
Before we buried Sara,
I scanned her body

407
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,924
using portable magnetic
resonance imaging.

408
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,693
Felicity, you're really
starting to freak me out.

409
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,861
I basically created
a virtual autopsy.

410
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:02,130
It's not as good as
a regular autopsy,

411
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:05,133
but like when I can use it to
determine things an autopsy would,

412
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:08,003
like angle of tack,
trajectory,

413
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,404
and the force
of the arrows.

414
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:12,174
Felicity, what are you saying?

415
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:13,542
There were certain
things about the forensics

416
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,110
that I couldn't
reconcile with,

417
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,845
specifically,
the angle

418
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,814
and the velocity of the arrows
were not consistent

419
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,148
with a normal bow
or archer

420
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,783
of normal height.

421
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:25,787
But if the arrows
were thrown with Mirakuru force...

422
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,558
What if there was some residual
Mirakuru in your system?

423
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,859
It would explain
the forensics.

424
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,761
The angle and the force
of the arrows.

425
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,863
But you said that
I tested negative for Mirakuru.

426
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,365
There isn't any in
your blood today,

427
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,367
but if one last
Mirakuru episode

428
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:41,536
burned down any remnants
in your system...

429
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,271
"Episode?"

430
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:45,006
You mean...

431
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:48,210
Me killing Sara.

432
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,591
I'm onsite.

433
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,993
Copy. Keep watching
the perimeter.

434
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:06,862
How many partners
do you have, anyway?

435
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,730
The Culebras.
The body in your gym,

436
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,398
the body in your storage locker.

437
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,867
Someone's gone
to a lot of trouble

438
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:13,368
to frame you for murders
and bring you here.

439
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,470
Why? What does all this
have to do with one killing

440
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:17,305
six years ago?

441
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:19,407
Hello, Ted.

442
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,243
I see you got my messages.

443
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:26,381
Arrows.

444
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:28,049
Brass knuckles.

445
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:30,752
I never knew why we couldn't just use
a gun the way they did.

446
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,755
Because we're better
than they are.

447
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:35,257
At least we're
supposed to be.

448
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:37,626
That's almost ironic,
coming from you.

449
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:39,060
I trusted you!

450
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:45,267
[Siren]
SCPD!

451
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:48,937
Ted Grant,
you are under arrest

452
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:50,639
for multiple counts
of homicide.

453
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:52,407
Officer: Don't move!

454
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,976
What are you
talkin' about?

455
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:57,012
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah?

456
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:59,114
Tell that to the stiff we found
in your locker.

457
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,816
Let's go.

458
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,047
Sorry he got past me.
He knew an exit out of the building

459
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:11,348
that wasn't on any
of the blueprints

460
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,449
that Felicity
hooked me up with.

461
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:14,551
You had Ted Grant
arrested?

462
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,419
Your father's men
found him at a crime scene.

463
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,822
Another body was found
at a storage locker that he owns,

464
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:21,558
along with evidence
of past vigilantism.

465
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,193
- No. He's innocent.
- I know.

466
00:22:23,195 --> 00:22:25,128
I saw the person
who's doing this.

467
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,863
Who is it?
[Exhales]

468
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:29,833
He was wearing Ted's old gear.
Full face mask.

469
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:31,568
Let's go.

470
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,871
Clearly Grant knows
who's behind the mask.

471
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:36,673
Oliver.

472
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:38,608
Laurel.

473
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,610
What's up?

474
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:41,878
I have to--

475
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,080
Roy, don't. Let's just--

476
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,917
I need to tell you
something.

477
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,452
Ok?

478
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,288
I...

479
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:56,793
I killed Sara.

480
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:02,331
That doesn't...

481
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,101
You're not making any sense.

482
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:08,537
Why would you kill Sara?

483
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:09,705
It was the Mirakuru.

484
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:11,807
Roy had no memory
of the attack.

485
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,809
No real memory, at least.
But he's been recalling

486
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:17,813
fragments of his Mirakuru
exposure last year.

487
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,849
That, and suppressed
memories

488
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,184
often resurface in dreams.

489
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:25,054
This is insane.

490
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:28,024
Laurel, I am so
sorry. I'm really--

491
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:29,525
Don't!

492
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:35,965
Wait, Roy, where do you think
you're going?

493
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,367
Let him go.

494
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:48,978
I thought he was cured.

495
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,414
What we know about Mirakuru
is vastly outweighed

496
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,249
by the things
we don't know.

497
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:56,285
What does that even mean?

498
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:59,755
That Roy killed my sister
and it's not his fault?

499
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:03,526
The arrows that killed Sara,

500
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:05,094
we pulled DNA off of them,
didn't we?

501
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:07,029
I tested it against the sample
of Roy's blood.

502
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,230
It was the first
thing I did.

503
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:10,299
And?

504
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:12,702
The results
were inconclusive.

505
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:15,438
I can't process
this right now.

506
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,940
[Sighs]

507
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:20,176
Hey.

508
00:24:20,178 --> 00:24:21,510
Hey.

509
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:22,745
Look at me.

510
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:26,115
Focus on what you can process.

511
00:24:26,117 --> 00:24:27,650
Ted knows
who we're coming after.

512
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,819
I need you
to find out who it is.

513
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:32,455
I can't. I can't. If Roy
killed Sara, then--

514
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:35,491
If Roy killed Sara, then...

515
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:39,695
We will deal with it.

516
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:44,033
For right now, I need you

517
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:45,601
to deal with Ted.

518
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:47,903
Ok?

519
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:51,340
Ok.

520
00:25:03,187 --> 00:25:05,154
How sure are you?

521
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:07,890
There's other
forensic evidence.

522
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:10,626
A virtual autopsy,
in light of what Roy's described,

523
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:13,329
it sounds
incriminating.

524
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:18,033
That, and his trouble sleeping
started right when Sara was killed.

525
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:27,643
My husband says you
are having problems

526
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:30,246
remembering what you saw
earlier today.

527
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:32,348
That's the problem.

528
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,517
I didn't see anything.

529
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,685
You see and hear far
more than you think.

530
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,654
Hidden truths,

531
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:40,990
very deep in
your sub-conscious.

532
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:43,859
You saw something,
but your head is too busy.

533
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,761
You need
to quiet it.

534
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:49,899
Close your eyes.

535
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:56,205
Take a deep breath.

536
00:25:56,207 --> 00:26:00,376
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

537
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:03,512
In...

538
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:05,014
And out.

539
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:06,515
And again.

540
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:10,486
You're floating,
in nothingness.

541
00:26:10,488 --> 00:26:12,922
All that exists
is your breath.

542
00:26:12,924 --> 00:26:15,991
Any thoughts you
have are clouds.

543
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:19,094
They just
drift away.

544
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:26,302
I remember.

545
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:32,575
16 murders.

546
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:35,945
17, counting the one
from six years ago.

547
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:40,683
That's more than
the son of Sam, less than Bundy.

548
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:43,719
Probably worth a mini-series,
huh? Maybe a book?

549
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:49,191
You became
a defense attorney?

550
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,760
Can I talk to him
for a minute?

551
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:54,129
[Exhales]

552
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:01,237
You sure can
pick 'em.

553
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,547
You ok?

554
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:14,450
I'm not the one facing
a lifetime in prison.

555
00:27:14,452 --> 00:27:15,985
Who framed you?

556
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:18,721
I don't know.

557
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:22,358
I can't help you if you're going
to keep lying to me.

558
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,661
The Arrow saw you with him.
He knows you know who it is.

559
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:28,731
Hey.

560
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:31,600
If the D.A.'s office
refuses to seek an indictment,

561
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:33,936
the police have
to release you.

562
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:37,239
But first...

563
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,108
I'm going to need you to be
straight with me.

564
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,077
Who was the man
behind the mask?

565
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:46,715
His name's Isaac Stanzler.

566
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:51,654
Six years ago, the Culebras
ran the Glades.

567
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:54,390
I thought it would be a good idea
for families to be able to live there

568
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:57,192
without worrying
about their kids getting shot.

569
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:59,695
So I decided to do
something about it.

570
00:27:59,697 --> 00:28:01,497
You became
a vigilante.

571
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:03,832
Just like your friend
in the green hood--

572
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:06,802
without the green hood.

573
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:08,203
And what about
Stanzler?

574
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:09,705
You know the guy
the Arrow's been

575
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:12,174
running around with lately?
The one in red?

576
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:16,011
Stanzler was my guy in red.

577
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:17,813
I guess you can call him
my apprentice.

578
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:19,949
And one night,
we decided to go after

579
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:23,485
this drug dealer that was
pushing crank near the school.

580
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:27,222
We tracked him all the way
to this nightclub.

581
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:29,591
And what happened?

582
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:32,561
That drug dealer...

583
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:35,731
Isaac got to him first.

584
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:39,835
That murder from
six years ago...

585
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:42,871
That wasn't you,
that was him.

586
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:47,509
[Sighs] I hung it up after that.

587
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:49,845
What about Stanzler?

588
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:52,881
What happened
to Isaac Stanzler?

589
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:55,851
I told him to get
the hell out of Starling.

590
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,854
That I never wanted
to see his face ever again.

591
00:28:58,856 --> 00:29:01,690
I cut him loose.

592
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:07,730
That's why I've been
lying to you this whole time, Laurel.

593
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:11,967
Everything that's happening
is my fault.

594
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:15,971
No word from Laurel?

595
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:18,040
Not yet.

596
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:20,209
But according
to SCPD email traffic,

597
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:21,810
which I may or may not
have hacked into,

598
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:23,112
they are dropping the charges
against Ted Grant.

599
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:25,514
Oliver, let me go after Roy.

600
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,182
If he's experiencing
Mirakuru side effects,

601
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,817
we can't leave him
running around.

602
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,619
So you bring him in.

603
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,121
Then what?

604
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,889
Oliver,
this crusade of ours,

605
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:36,225
it's supposed to be about
justice, right?

606
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:38,127
So if that's supposed
to mean something,

607
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:39,895
we can have two sets of rules--

608
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:41,830
one for the bad guys
and one for us.

609
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:44,533
I'm the one who brought Roy
into this crusade.

610
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,969
And maybe it's time
for you to cut him loose.

611
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:49,438
Are you telling me
to abandon him?

612
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,974
Yes, Oliver.

613
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:54,910
If that's what it takes
to find justice for Sara.

614
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:04,319
So what do you think
Stanzler's next move is?

615
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:06,121
Well, framing me
didn't work.

616
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:08,223
I'm almost afraid to think of what he
might try to do next.

617
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,125
What I should have
done from the start.

618
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:15,931
After you abandoned me,
the Culebra family,

619
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:18,634
they wanted payback
for the man they lost.

620
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:22,504
They tortured me for months
before I escaped.

621
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:23,972
Isaac, I'm so sorry.

622
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:25,641
I didn't know.

623
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:27,743
You have every
right to hate me.

624
00:30:27,745 --> 00:30:29,745
But come on,
let's talk about this.

625
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:31,580
Oh, don't worry,
we will.

626
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,950
There's so much I have to say
before I kill you.

627
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:48,564
Where are we going?

628
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:49,965
Just drive!

629
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,433
Hey, your beef is with me.

630
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,069
Ok, you got me. Let her go.

631
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:56,305
Taking innocent people hostage?

632
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:57,939
Man, I taught you better
than that.

633
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,574
They're not people,
they're criminals.

634
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:02,210
Albert Mancini wasn't. You still

635
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:03,945
- strung him up in that nightclub.
- You taught me that

636
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,982
there are no innocents when
you abandoned me to the Culebras.

637
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:10,052
You gave me
direction, purpose.

638
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:13,188
And then when things got tough,
when I really needed you,

639
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,623
you weren't there.

640
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,492
[Cell phone vibrating]
It's Laurel.

641
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:19,673
Put her on speaker.

642
00:31:19,674 --> 00:31:21,441
Isaac: I hated you
so much for that.

643

00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,339
and when he was shooting
at my friends,

808
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,541
I should have
been so scared.

809
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:01,743
Rattled.

810
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,378
But I wasn't.

811
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,014
I saw what needed
to be done, and I did it.

812
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:07,683
Because you taught me.

813
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:10,285
I've just been teaching you how
to throw a proper jab.

814
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:13,088
And your pal Robin Hood
doesn't want me even doing that.

815
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,225
I want you
to give me the tools

816
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,327
to avenge my sister's death.

817
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:22,364
I want you to teach me to get
justice outside of a courtroom.

818
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:24,066
I took on
an apprentice once.

819
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,634
That didn't
work out so good.

820
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:27,436
Well, it's like you said--

821
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:29,705
it's not about how you get
knocked down to the mat.

822
00:41:29,707 --> 00:41:32,274
It's about whether you get up.

823
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:55,631
Who the hell are you?

824
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:01,603
I'm Cupid, stupid.

825
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:03,639
