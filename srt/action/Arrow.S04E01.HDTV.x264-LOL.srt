1
00:00:01,278 --> 00:00:02,845
Last season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:05,142
Was it worth it,
all the pain and misery

3
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:06,676
you brought back
from that island?

4
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,044
The reason I came back

5
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:10,580
was to try and save
the people of this city.

6
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:11,681
You've got the wrong guy.

7
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:12,749
Oliver Queen isn't
the Arrow.

8
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,950
I am.

9
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:15,084
Unh!

10
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:17,153
Everyone thinks
the Arrow is dead,

11
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:19,322
which means Oliver Queen
is innocent.

12
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:21,291
When I joined the League
I was conscripted with another man,

13
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:23,726
Damian Darhk.
Damian continues the League's ways,

14
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:27,397
but through his own organization
filled with a hive of agents.

15
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,364
John?

16
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,899
Something's wrong.

17
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,868
First let me assure you that
no harm will come to Lyla.

18
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,204
You didn't just lose
my friendship,

19
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,406
you lost my trust.
You lost my respect.

20
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:39,108
It was about making sure
that you and you were safe.

21
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,911
I had to keep the circle
as small as possible.

22
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:45,215
You opened up my heart
in a way

23
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:48,551
I didn't even know
was possible.

24
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:50,420
And I love you.

25
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,555
Can I say something
strange?

26
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:53,923
I'm happy.

27
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:14,143
How you doin'?

28
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:24,621
Hey.

29
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,324
Oh. Ok.

30
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:30,208
Hot--

31
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:31,232
Hot.

32
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,965
Felicity Smoak...

33
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,700
Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:40,203
You have failed this omelet.

35
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,338
Really?

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,740
Yeah.

37
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:49,178
You know, it's criminal
how easily cooking's come to you.

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,414
Well, I always wanted
to expand my horizons

39
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,416
beyond what I could do
on the island,

40
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:57,186
which was basically...
was cooked and uncooked.

41
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:58,288
How was your jog?

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,789
It was good.

43
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,457
I'm getting used to
running

44
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,558
without chasing
after someone.

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,793
Mm-hmm.

46
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:04,994
Kind of sweaty.

47
00:02:04,996 --> 00:02:07,664
I know.
It's amazing.

48
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,735
Why'd you get this one
removed?

49
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:14,871
I don't need it anymore.

50
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,175
So what do you have planned
for the rest of the day?

51
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,678
A business conference
with the Palmer Tech board,

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,316
who still question whether
I'm fit enough to inherit Ray's legacy.

53
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:27,817
Hey, how'd you like
the company back

54
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,619
as an early
Christmas gift?

55
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,721
You're doing a better
job of running it than I would.

56
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:33,156
It's flirting
with bankruptcy.

57
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:35,191
Exactly.
This is flirting.

58
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,426
Mmm.

59
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:37,493
I gotta go.

60
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:38,828
Where are you going now?

61
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,496
I have to get stuff
at the Farmers Market

62
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:41,864
for brunch tomorrow.

63
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,667
Right. The Hoffmans
are coming over. I forgot.

64
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,703
I'm never gonna get tired
of making plans

65
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:48,638
that don't involve
people shooting at me.

66
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:58,448
This is so cool!

67
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,651
We're really gonna have to work
on your definition of cool.

68
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:06,389
Get back.

69
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:08,057
This is so awesome!

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,101
Speedy, behind you!

71
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,936
Oh!

72
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:22,572
I thought I told you guys
to call me Red Arrow.

73
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:26,242
A Red Arrow just means
you can't make a left turn.

74
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:28,444
Whatever. I'm inside
the hijacked truck.

75
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:43,860
Canary, you're up.

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,781
They've got backup.

77
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:34,634
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Arrow 4x01 ♪</font>

Original Air Date on October 7, 2015

79
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:41,918
Anyone manage to get eyes
on that stolen cargo?

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,788
They look like
equipment containers.

81
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,757
Not equipment. Weapons.

82
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,325
Among other things,
Kord Industries

83
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,260
is one of the largest
arms manufacturers in the world.

84
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:53,596
They also make a really
awesome cell phone.

85
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,565
Yeah, but weapons
are more likely.

86
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:59,869
These ghosts, if that's
seriously what we're calling them,

87
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,304
are stepping up
their attacks.

88
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,306
Escalating.
People are so scared,

89
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:04,941
they don't even want
to leave their homes.

90
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,409
Unless it's to pack up
in the middle of the night,

91
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:07,777
get the hell out of town.

92
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,479
What do you want us
to do,

93
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:11,013
take our football
and go home?

94
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:13,683
No. We ask for help.

95
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,686
Oliver walked away.

96
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:19,989
That was before these guys
started taking over our city

97
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:22,191
and turning it into a war zone.
We're dealing with a crisis.

98
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:25,828
Which Oliver believed
we could handle, Laurel.

99
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,363
And he was right.

100
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:34,036
I spoke to Walter Steele
last night. He passed.

101
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:36,139
Well, does
that surprise you?

102
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,541
In 3 years we've had 3 mayors
and one candidate for mayor

103
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,810
who've all ended up dead.
Anyone with any common sense

104
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:42,345
is not gonna throw
their hat in the ring.

105
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,180
Can't we just go on
as we have,

106
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:46,115
running city hall by committee instead
of electing a mayor?

107
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:49,352
Maybe we should have you
focused on catching these Ghosts.

108
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:51,020
That's just what
the media calls them,

109
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,388
because they disappear
like ghosts.

110
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,357
Yeah, I didn't say
it wasn't cute.

111
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:57,727
The truth is, these guys
are hard to catch.

112
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,662
They're not your average
everyday criminals.

113
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:01,964
Average everyday criminals
don't have cyanide capsules

114
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:05,701
in their teeth so they can
off themselves rather than be interrogated.

115
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:06,936
I'm doin' the best
I can here.

116
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,804
We need you
to do better.

117
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:11,908
This city was dying before more masks
showed up to wreak havoc.

118
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,044
Look, we'll get these guys
eventually and things will turn around.

119
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:16,779
I mean, look,
we rebranded the city,

120
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,848
we got the new
tourism program,

121
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,583
we got the new high-speed
rail line to Central City.

122
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,552
Hopefully from
Central City.

123
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:25,788
Well, maybe we can have
a Flash day, just like them.

124
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,491
Bottom line, we need
an influx of people,

125
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:31,127
which means an influx of cash.

126
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:37,233
Oh, no, no.
Keep your seats.

127
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:39,802
Excuse me, this is
a private meeting.

128
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:40,903
Oh, excellent.

129
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:43,973
I despise interruptions.

130
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:45,374
Who the hell are you?

131
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:48,211
Me? I'm the man
you're looking for.

132
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:51,948
I'm the one who controls--
what do you people call them?

133
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,717
The ghosts?

134
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,420
So you're all fretting
about the city dying.

135
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:59,322
I'm here on behalf
of an organization

136
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,991
that wants you
to let it die.

137
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:03,226
See, death
is a beautiful thing.

138
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,894
We die,
we go into the ground,

139
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,063
our remains grow
into flowers.

140
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:11,267
It's only in the interval
after dying that new things can sprout.

141
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,868
And now,
get the hell out of--

142
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,504
Cities are like puppies.

143
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:18,507
You see them writhing
in agony on the streets,

144
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,842
you put them down.
You don't let them suffer.

145
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,077
I'm getting security.

146
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,946
Susanna, calm down.
Get down.

147
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:27,083
That's very rude behavior.

148
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:32,321
None of you seem
particularly likeable,

149
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:34,657
but if you do have
any friends

150
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,691
or anyone
who does love you,

151
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:38,527
I suggest you say goodbye.

152
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:40,296
My people will be in touch.

153
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,471
Mmm, mmm. Oh, Oliver,

154
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,805
these eggs are heaven.

155
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,741
Don't tell me you made them--

156
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:54,210
In the slow cooker.
The slow cooker you got us, yeah.

157
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,678
Aww.
I knew it. I knew it.

158
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,780
People are always
so hesitant to try them,

159
00:07:57,782 --> 00:07:59,715
but slow cookers
are absolute life-changers.

160
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:01,717
I don't know how that
is not a bumper sticker yet.

161
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,619
I know.

162
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,254
On the topic
of life-changers,

163
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:08,424
you guys really need
to get on the school situation here.

164
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:11,460
We could write you a recommendation
letter for our school's waiting list.

165
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:15,898
But--but wouldn't it help to
have kids first, or, I don't know, a kid?

166
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,134
Oh, it takes years
to get on that list.

167
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:20,970
And I'm sure kids aren't
too far down the line for you two.

168
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:22,938
Yeah, we haven't
talked about it.

169
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,041
Who wants more mimosas?

170
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:27,310
I need to see it.
Do you have it on you?

171
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,711
Shh, shh.
Honey--

172
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,346
You have it on you, right?
Do you have it?

173
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:31,881
Yeah.

174
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:35,551
Oh, it's stunning.

175
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:36,752
It's my mother's.

176
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,054
So, when are you gonna

177
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,288
pop the question?

178
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,556
Tonight.

179
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:41,290
What are you guys talking--

180
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,958
Whoa!

181
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,527
Dude!

182
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,662
Nice reflexes!

183
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,940
Back off, psycho.

184
00:08:57,942 --> 00:08:59,508
6 people have died

185
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,243
from the crank
you've been pushing.

186
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:02,778
4 of them were kids!

187
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,990
Aah!

188
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:29,905
You've certainly chosen
an unusual hobby, Mr. Queen.

189
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:31,874
He said he'd kill us all.

190
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:33,909
That was a hell
of a press conference.

191
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,911
These people needed
a strong reminder

192
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:38,280
that the city doesn't
bow to terrorists.

193
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:39,849
Susanna?

194
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:44,086
I thought that tasted funny.

195
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:47,022
Call 911!

196
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:50,126
John, we have a new problem.

197
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,128
The city's leadership
is being targeted.

198
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,262
They just poisoned
the district attorney.

199
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:54,897
I'm headed to my father.

200
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,166
I need you and Thea
and all the other two members.

201
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,438
Great.

202
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,809
I'm closest to the head
of emergency services.

203
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,944
Thea, I need you
at city hall.

204
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,049
Are you ok?

205
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:18,654
Can we get
a nurse over here?

206
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:21,290
Hey, listen, the district attorney
just collapsed.

207
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,159
Staffers think
it might be poison.

208
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,560
I need toxicology--

209
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,043
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

210
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,511
It's all right.

211
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:45,114
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

212
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,191
Just hold on.
I'll get you some help.

213
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:01,797
Unh! You ok?

214
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,237
Captain Lance,
you were warned.

215
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,522
Gaah! Unh!

216
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,429
Are you ok?

217
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,231
Oh, yeah,
it's just a flesh wound.

218
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:38,567
Captain Lance, the district attorney
was pronounced dead,

219
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,669
and reports are coming in
that the city comptroller

220
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,005
and the head of emergency
services have also been killed.

221
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,374
That's pretty much
the city's leadership.

222
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:48,577
Carries on like this,
there won't be a city left to lead.

223
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,041
So what's the occasion?

224
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,610
We need an occasion
for dinner?

225
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:56,734
No. Ever since
you discovered cooking,

226
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,470
life's been a never-ending
episode of "Master Chef."

227
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:02,174
But this isn't dinner.
This is a production.

228
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,541
Are we...
Celebrating something?

229
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:07,410
It sort of depends
on how dessert goes.

230
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,779
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm almost disgustingly full.

231
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:13,383
You are going to have
to try a bite or two of this souffle.

232
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:17,053
Oh, diet saved by the bell.

233
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,828
Uh...

234
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,063
You have visitors.

235
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,402
We probably should have
called first, but...

236
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:35,539
We really need your help.

237
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,173
The media has been calling
them the Ghosts.

238
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,608
They're like nothing
we'd ever seen before.

239
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,709
Well-trained, well-armed.

240
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,211
And committed.

241
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:42,579
Anytime we get too close
to one of them,

242
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,847
they off themselves
with cyanide.

243
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,181
What's their agenda?

244
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,816
At first we thought
they were thieves

245
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:49,352
because they were hitting
banks and jewelry stores.

246
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:52,022
Then we found out that they'd just been
building their war chest.

247
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:54,157
They've now been stealing
munitions and heavy arms.

248
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,859
And assassinating
people.

249
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:58,428
Hon...

250
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,896
Where are the police?

251
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:00,897
Overwhelmed.

252
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,232
Well, a group of this size

253
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:04,167
has to work out of
a central location,

254
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,769
a base of operations.

255
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,871
Which we haven't
been able to find.

256
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:10,941
Dig seems to think
we can handle it.

257
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:12,342
You disagree?

258
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:15,412
I think we're
in over our heads.

259
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:17,914
We need the Arrow.

260
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,056
The Arrow's dead.

261
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,058
We're hoping
that's not the case.

262
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,127
We're hoping that you can't change
who you are in your bones.

263
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,629
Come help us
stop these guys,

264
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:34,564
and then you can
come back to your--

265
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:38,401
your domestic life
of tranquility and souffles.

266
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,637
Huh.

267
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:45,008
You're
uncharacteristically quiet.

268
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,043
What should I say?

269
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:49,879
Our friends need our help.
We should already be in the car.

270
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:54,150
How did you find me?

271
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:55,652
The world's too small

272
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:58,555
for someone like Oliver Queen
to disappear.

273
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,825
Truth be told, I expected
to find you in Starling City.

274
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:04,127
I don't want to be
near my family.

275
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,029
Because of what
you did to Shrieve?

276
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:07,897
I read his autopsy report.

277
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,001
I knew you had a capacity
for the unfathomable,

278
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,603
but I actually
underestimated you.

279
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:15,305
What do you want, Amanda?

280
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:16,806
To help you.

281
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,909
You haven't returned home

282
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:21,811
because you feel
you're a monster.

283
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:24,514
You're trying to deny it,
channeling your killer instinct

284
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:26,683
into something productive.

285
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:30,020
But you can't change
who you are in your bones.

286
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:31,521
I don't need a therapist.

287
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:35,425
The hood and eye makeup
may suggest otherwise.

288
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:40,363
Stop trying to run
from your inner darkness.

289
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,565
Embrace it.

290
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:45,101
Let it run its course.

291
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:49,639
Oftentimes, the only way out
is through.

292
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:55,712
Through what?

293
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:08,224
Argus agents.

294
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:12,962
When you wake up,

295
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:16,032
just remember
that I'm trying to help you.

296
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:20,570
Here I thought that my days

297
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:23,440
of riding in the back
of limos was long gone.

298
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:28,344
Ah--one of the perks of being
Palmer Technology's CEO in absentia.

299
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:31,081
Now that I'm back, they might actually
expect me to do stuff.

300
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:35,351
I wouldn't worry.
We're not going to stay long.

301
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:38,655
Jeez.

302
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:43,193
It's tough not to look
out this window with wonder.

303
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:45,762
Wonder what?

304
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:48,465
What did we really
accomplish?

305
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,634
Felicity and I have a lot
to catch up on,

306
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:54,137
so maybe take us through
all the evidence the team has gathered.

307
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,172
That's easy. Nothing.

308
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:58,174
Ok, so maybe we'll go
through all the encounters

309
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,009
that you've had
with the ghosts,

310
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:02,879
everywhere they've hidden,
and places you can cross...

311
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,915
John...

312
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,617
We should have discussed this.

313
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:08,818
Thea and I did.

314
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,554
We need him.

315
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:15,258
I'm not expecting you
to welcome me back with open arms.

316
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,228
What I did to you
is not easily forgiven.

317
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,096
I'm here to help you
with your problem,

318
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:21,531
and then I'm gone.

319
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,066
Oliver, we don't need
your help.

320
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:24,601
And if we did,
we'd probably choose someone

321
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:26,703
who didn't kidnap my wife
and endanger my child.

322
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:29,806
And no one is asking you
to pretend like that didn't happen.

323
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:31,741
But we're in trouble.
The city is in trouble.

324
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,711
Laurel, I don't need you
to remind me of that.

325
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:37,347
I just can't go into battle
with a man I don't trust.

326
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:40,884
Understood. But things
are a little worse than you guys thought.

327
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:44,220
I hacked into Kord Industries computers
just to see what the Ghosts stole.

328
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:46,956
Cluster bombs.
Sensor fused and high yield.

329
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,838
Any more powerful and they'd
have to be nuclear.

330
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:51,795
What do you want to do,
John?

331
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:53,196
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes

332
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:54,631
to save my city.

333
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,732
Weapons need targets.

334
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,868
These had to be stolen
for a reason.

335
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,837
Felicity, hack into Kord
Industry databases.

336
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,053
I want to know everything there is
to know about these explosives.

337
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:08,787
Laurel, we want to start
a dialogue with your father

338
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:10,389
and make a list
of potential targets.

339
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:13,892
Dig, Thea, hit the streets,
see what we can find.

340
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,097
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

341
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,798
Old habits.

342
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
It's probably
not a bad idea

343
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,268
to give your father
a heads-up.

344
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,437
Copy.

345
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,005
John, look--

346
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:29,475
I have a wife and a toddler
to get back home to.

347
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,410
Felicity, will you let me
know if you find anything?

348
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:34,513
Will do.
Say hi to Lyla for me.

349
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:37,182
He'll come around.

350
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:38,617
I'll go hit the streets.

351
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:42,621
Well, I have to say
it feels good to be at a keyboard

352
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:44,256
for something other
than a teleconference.

353
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,125
I need a map with a list
of all the spots

354
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:49,294
the ghosts have hit, including where
they encountered the team.

355
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:51,330
And if we get lucky,
maybe we can--

356
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:53,632
Triangulate and determine
the point of origin

357
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,067
of where the ghosts
are operating out of, yes?

358
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:56,835
Yeah.

359
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:59,972
All right, here's the rest
of all their heists and attacks.

360
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,039
That was fast.

361
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,209
Yeah? Yeah, like
riding a bike?

362
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:06,111
First spot they hit
the Larson Credit Union?

363
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:07,446
No, no, no.
It was Starling National.

364
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:08,680
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?

365
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:10,382
How'd you know that?

366
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:12,651
Sam way you knew
about Larson.

367
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:13,506
Felicity.

368
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,221
Want to play a game?

369
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,455
What game am I playing?

370
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,090
Playing the reason
that you know so much

371
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,691
about the ghosts is because

372
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:23,061
you've been helping
the team behind my back game.

373
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:28,500
These guys have got cluster bombs now?
You gotta be kidding me.

374
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:30,869
Well, that's why I'm here, to see
if you're aware of any potential targets.

375
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,838
The only thing
that I'm aware of

376
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,473
is that I want you to stay as far away
from this mess as possible.

377
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:36,074
Dad, I thought
we'd moved past this.

378
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:37,476
We've moved past
a lot of things,

379
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:39,311
and I am glad, really.
But I don't want you

380
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:41,079
mixing it up
with these psychos.

381
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,382
Even after what happened
to the leadership?

382
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:46,084
I mean, honestly.
I thought that you would be happy

383
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:47,119
to have our help.

384
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,253
Do I look happy?

385
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:50,856
Dad, the Ghosts were
dangerous before

386
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:52,658
they go their hands
on experimental explosives.

387
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,194
How are you gonna feel
when they take out a city block,

388
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:56,562
knowing you didn't
do anything to stop it.

389
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:03,435
Have you heard of anything
going on that's a potential target?

390
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:05,871
Landmarks, Starling General,
et cetera.

391
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:08,607
What about city events?
Any dignitaries coming to town?

392
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:09,908
A few ballgames, concerts.

393
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,577
Not that there's anyone
to buy a ticket.

394
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,378
Train station's getting
reopened tomorrow night

395
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,013
for that new rail line.

396
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,716
And Starling General
is having a canned food drive.

397
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:21,386
People don't come
to Star City anymore, Laurel.

398
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:23,088
They want to leave.

399
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,858
Who is the cutest?

400
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,460
Who is the cutest,
ever, ever?

401
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:32,130
Playing with her like that,
I'm pretty sure it's you.

402
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,967
It's amazing how everything
else can just melt away

403
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,736
except for her.

404
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,905
What's melting tonight?

405
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,407
I know it's been
a rough few months.

406
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,109
These men
you're dealing with.

407
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:46,311
Tonight it's just one man.

408
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:48,580
Oliver's back.

409
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,382
That didn't take long.

410
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,184
If you knew he was coming back.
Why didn't you warn me?

411
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,785
What's the saying?

412
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:55,621
"Only the dead have
seen the end of war."

413
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:57,189
Oliver's not a soldier.

414
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,190
Isn't he?

415
00:19:58,192 --> 00:19:59,558
That's pretty forgiving,

416
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,994
considering he kidnapped you
6 months ago.

417
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:03,896
You know why he did.

418
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:07,132
You have to let go
of it sometime. I have.

419
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:08,567
That's because
you're better than me.

420
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:11,436
That's one of the reasons
why I love you.

421
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,305
It was war, Johnny.

422
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,207
Maybe not against a country,

423
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,175
but it was war.

424
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:19,878
And in time of war,
we do what we have to do.

425
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,979
Really, Lyla?

426
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:23,348
I mean, that include
lying to me?

427
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,450
Lying to Felicity?

428
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:27,219
What was the point?

429
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:30,656
Oliver did what he thought
he had to do to defeat Ra's.

430
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:32,925
I'm not saying
he made the right choice.

431
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,360
But if Oliver Queen
always made the right choice,

432
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:37,329
he wouldn't need you.

433
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:42,434
I used to think that
yelling Oliver was scary.

434
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:44,836
I'm starting to think
that silent Oliver is a lot worse.

435
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:46,672
I'm just going over the past
5 months in my head.

436
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,474
When you got food poisoning
when we were in Thailand...

437
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:51,610
Yes. I might have been
secretly working with the team,

438
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:54,046
but I didn't exactly lie
about the food poisoning.

439
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:55,714
Laab moo is extremely
hard to digest.

440
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:59,051
What about when you
missed our boat, missed in Positano?

441
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:01,720
Ok, that one was
a little fib.

442
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,822
Bali?

443
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,391
Felicity, you said
there wasn't even email in Bali.

444
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:07,626
I know!

445
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,428
But we both know
I'm just that good.

446
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,463
I don't understand.
The whole point of starting over

447
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:13,198
was to get away
from all of this,

448
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,967
and we were both right there together
leading that charge.

449
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,970
I know. And I thought
that's what we needed.

450
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,671
And the first few months
were great, really great.

451
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:21,173
But then when you
and Laura Hoffman

452
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:22,507
started exchanging
cooking tips,

453
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:24,710
I secretly wanted
to gouge out my eyes.

454
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,678
I thought you were happy.

455
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
I was. Deliriously
happy with you,

456
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:31,316
but bored
with everything else.

457
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:32,188
I missed this.

458
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:35,871
I missed saving the city
and helping people.

459
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:39,224
It gives my life purpose.

460
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,860
And I wish I got
the same thrill

461
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:43,929
from picking between
the dimpled flatware or the scalloped,

462
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:45,897
but I just don't.

463
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,967
Hey. I don't care
that you lied to me.

464
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:50,102
I don't care.

465
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:52,070
I care that the entire time

466
00:21:52,072 --> 00:21:54,940
we were supposed to be
away together,

467
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:57,009
part of you was still here,

468
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,212
I love every moment
that I'm with you,

469
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:01,613
no matter where we are.

470
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:05,651
What's that?

471
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:07,314
I hacked Kord Industries
to check their design schematics

472
00:22:07,315 --> 00:22:07,969
for their bombs.

473
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,751
Turns out they have
a GPS tracker built in.

474
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,556
Can you find out
where it is?

475
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:13,091
At least where they've been.

476
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:14,693
GPS is offline now, but
their last location was...

477
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:16,595
Admiral Transport
interchange.

478
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:18,597
It's a truck depot
outside Pennytown.

479
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,298
Closed up shop
two months ago.

480
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I'll call Thea.
You get Laurel and Dig.

481
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:24,069
This might be a good time
to tell you that Cisco

482
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,605
worked up a little something
before he knew you were leaving.

483
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:28,040
A new suit.

484
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,709
We're not staying long enough
for a new suit.

485
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,616
I knew there were places
like this.

486
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:40,519
Owners must have left when
the city started tanking.

487
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:44,356
Well, our new friends
seem to have found a use for it.

488
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:46,425
Gentlemen, the world's a--

489
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:47,759
it's a funny place.

490
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:49,227
It resists change.

491
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:50,729
It fights progress.

492
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:53,598
And so the only way
to move things forward

493
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,934
is to fight back.

494
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,937
And you men are here today
because you understand that.

495
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,173
But our cause
is only as strong

496
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:03,942
as our weakest man.

497
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:07,446
Mr. Alvarez,
please step forward.

498
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:12,284
You commanded the hijacking
the other night,

499
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:14,352
the cluster bombs
from Kord Industries.

500
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,388
Yes, sir.
We encountered some resistance,

501
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,623
but we handled it.

502
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,593
Hand--hand--

503
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:23,695
Well, I guess my definition
of "handled"

504
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,163
is a little different
than yours.

505
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:27,866
You see, when I "handle"
a problem,

506
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,701
the problem dies.

507
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:30,802
Sir, we got away
with the bombs--

508
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:31,970
Shh!

509
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:34,873
You know, I love this town
in the fall.

510
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,142
I mean, yes, it looks
pretty much the same

511
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:38,910
as it does in the other
3 seasons,

512
00:23:38,912 --> 00:23:41,213
but I admire consistency.

513
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:45,517
I respect dependability.

514
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,219
And you've shown me
neither.

515
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:50,689
So now, allow me
to show you something.

516
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:53,291
It's another kind of beauty.

517
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:57,162
It's the manipulation
of primordial energies.

518
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:59,664
No? Over your head? Yeah.

519
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,399
The grazing of the levers

520
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:04,002
that God uses
to move the world.

521
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:06,505
No? No?

522
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:09,775
This.

523
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:14,179
Oh, my God.

524
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,714
What the hell is that?

525
00:24:19,353 --> 00:24:20,752
Move!

526
00:24:48,582 --> 00:24:51,349
Hey, speedy!

527
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,890
What are they gonna do with
the explosives?

528
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:00,091
Train...

529
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:01,393
Tell me!

530
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:04,095
They're gonna destroy
Star City station.

531
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:11,002
We got to go.

532
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:13,071
We got to go.

533
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:28,843
Oh, I remember that look.

534
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:30,144
That is not a good look.

535
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:31,912
We found out what they
had planned, at least.

536
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,248
They're gonna use the explosives on
the new train station.

537
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,318
Ah, pretty sure
I had that one in the office pool.

538
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,019
Too soon?

539
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:40,521
They're probably planning the attack
for tomorrow night,

540
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:42,489
celebrate the re-opening
of the new rail line.

541
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:44,725
Are we not gonna talk about
what just happened?

542
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:47,561
That dude just killed
that guy by touching him.

543
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:49,396
Wait, we're dealing
with a metahuman?

544
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:50,598
Like we didn't have
enough problems?

545
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,899
He wasn't a metahuman.

546
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,634
Oliver, what that man did
was not natural.

547
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,003
I know.
It was mystical.

548
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:58,772
How can you be
so sure?

549
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,175
Because I've seen things.

550
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:04,278
There's things that
can't be explained,

551
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,579
even by science.

552
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:06,880
I suppose you aren't
going to tell us

553
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:08,248
about these things
you've seen, Oliver.

554
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,317
We need to focus on finding
the cluster bombs.

555
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,685
Can you activate
the GPS?

556
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:13,287
Eventually.
But I'm pretty sure

557
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,788
the train station's
gonna be blown up by then.

558
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,692
Fine. So we do this
the old-fashioned way.

559
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:21,261
So this is the
old-fashioned way?

560
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:23,697
Can we maybe discuss
last night?

561
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,734
It's pretty amazing,
right?

562
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:29,470
But how could you
ever want to give up that rush?

563
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:30,871
Extremely easily.

564
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,673
It's--it's not what
I'm talking about.

565
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,742
You seemed a little
out of control.

566
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:36,577
This coming from the guy

567
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:38,946
who used to use
criminals as target practice.

568
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:42,216
I'm amazed by how far
you've come in 5 months,

569
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:45,486
and I'm under no illusions
that this isn't a violent life.

570
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:48,422
I just, I want you
to remember that it's restraint

571
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:50,824
separating us from them.

572
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:55,496
Well, you've managed
to be back, what, 24 hours

573
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:56,864
before giving me
a lecture.

574
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,233
Think I owe Laurel
50 bucks.

575
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:01,135
I'm being serious.

576
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:03,170
How long has this been
going on for?

577
00:27:03,172 --> 00:27:05,072
Nothing is going on.

578
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:08,475
Ok, I've just--just
become a better fighter.

579
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:11,779
A better fighter remains in control
when they fight.

580
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,681
Is everything ok?

581
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:15,916
It's not ok.

582
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:18,986
My brother can't seem to
stay out of my business.

583
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:24,291
Any luck?

584
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:26,393
No.

585
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,229
Does Thea seem
a little off to you?

586
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,898
No, she's fine.

587
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,367
Just a little too
aggressive maybe.

588
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:36,704
Remember, you were
the same way when you started out.

589
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:39,540
Saw that you took my advice on the
identity concealment.

590
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,675
Oliver, man,
what are we doing?

591
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:42,976
Pretending
everything's normal,

592
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,578
that we are normal?

593
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,879
I'm looking for a way in.

594
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,247
I was furious to think
that you trusted

595
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,249
Malcolm Merlin more
than you trust me.

596
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,418
But then I realized that
I'm not angry at you,

597
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,787
I'm angry at myself for
thinking you're someone

598
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:55,189
that you clearly aren't.

599
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:57,091
I don't know
what that means.

600
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,426
Oliver, after everything
we've been through, man,

601
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,429
I couldn't fathom why
you didn't trust me.

602
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,465
But then I realized
you couldn't.

603
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,600
It's not who you are.

604
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,304
You don't trust.
You don't love.

605
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,840
You were able to fool
Ra’s and join the League

606
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:15,943
because inside you are
every bit as dark as they are.

607
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:21,281
Thank you
for coming.

608
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,483
Responding to
a bomb threat's

609
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:24,251
kind of in the SCPD
job description.

610
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:26,420
You know what I mean.
I'm glad we're working together.

611
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:28,956
It seems like you're working
with a lot of people these days.

612
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,124
What's that supposed
to mean?

613
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,625
Excuse me.
Dad.

614
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,428
Prodigal Arrow returns.

615
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,662
Captain Lance.

616
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:37,064
I thought that was you
last night,

617
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,899
some mask over your head.
Felt like old times.

618
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,334
Only trying to help.

619
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:42,102
That were true,
you wouldn't have come back.

620
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:44,671
This town started going to crap
the moment you put on that hood.

621
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:46,306
You brought madness
into all of our lives,

622
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,309
and the monster you were
inspired monsters.

623
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,279
Maybe.

624
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,314
But I'm not a monster
anymore.

625
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,317
Then what are you?

626
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:12,866
Nice nap?

627
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:15,836
I wasn't napping.
I was drugged.

628
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,104
Where's Waller?

629
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:19,406
Back in Coast City
sleeping off the scotch.

630
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:20,641
Wake her up.

631
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:21,842
I want to know what
I'm doing here.

632
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,310
Director Waller
has asked me

633
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:26,146
to thank you for agreeing
to take on this mission.

634
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:29,817
I didn't agree
to take on any--

635
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:31,351
Sorry. We're in a bit
of a clock here.

636
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,986
Now, you're getting
off this plane.

637
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,354
You can do that with
a chute on your back

638
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,323
or a bullet in your head.
Your call.

639
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,600
Why is Waller
doing this?

640
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:47,968
Guess she likes you.

641
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,770
I didn't think Waller
could like anybody.

642
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:51,572
Plus, you know the terrain.

643
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:52,739
What terrain?

644
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:55,242
Your job is to infiltrate
the area,

645
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:57,377
assess the threat,
and report back.

646
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:01,081
You have AES-encrypted
communication gear in your pack.

647
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:05,018
Now, according to
our Intel,

648
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,421
your target may be
radar capable,

649
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:09,423
so you'll have to HALO in.

650
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:12,226
So when you think
you're about to splat,

651
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,995
only then do you pull
the shoot.

652
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,035
Wait, is that--

653
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,403
Uhh!

654
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,877
Uh-oh.
You have mopey face.

655
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:32,246
Were you worried
after 5 months of happiness

656
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,981
that you weren't going to be able to
make it anymore?

657
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:35,649
I ran into Lance.

658
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,585
And he gave you
a hug because he missed you?

659
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,221
Yeah, well,
it's not just Lance.

660
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:44,625
Thea. There is something
wrong with Thea.

661
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:46,526
She doesn't want my help
and neither does Diggle.

662
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,763
We should never have
come back here.

663
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,999
Let's go.
Let's go home.

664
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,600
You don't want to go home.

665
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,336
I love our new home.

666
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:58,906
And I love you.

667
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,407
But I also love it here,

668
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:02,109
and you can't honestly
tell me that you don't.

669
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,811
Yeah, no, of course
I miss aspects of it.

670
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:08,315
The sense of purpose,
the idea of helping people.

671
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,150
But Lance was right.

672
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:11,718
About what?

673
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:15,589
A few months ago
he told me

674
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:17,457
that all I brought
back from the island

675
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:21,461
was pain, misery,
and darkness.

676
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:25,565
Of course I knew
that the moment we came back here,

677
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,601
that darkness would
be waiting for me.

678
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,369
Well, he's wrong.
Dead wrong.

679
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:31,738
You didn't bring the darkness back
with you from Lian Yu.

680
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,106
But, Felicity,
I'm telling you that

681
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:35,676
the only way I know
how to fight the darkness

682
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:38,912
is to be darkness.
That is why I left.

683
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:42,149
And I don't want to
be that type of person anymore.

684
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,519
Maybe you just need to be
a different kind of person.

685
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:50,157
And you're not doing this
alone anymore.

686
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,825
Train station
was a bust.

687
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,327
No incendiaries
on the platform,

688
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,329
on the tracks,
or inside any of the trains.

689
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,897
Yeah, but if there's no bomb
in the station,

690
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,700
then how did
they expect to blow it up?

691
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:02,369
You didn't bring
the darkness here.

692
00:32:03,472 --> 00:32:04,972
The bombs aren't
at the station

693
00:32:04,974 --> 00:32:06,073
because they're
bringing them in.

694
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,507
On a train.

695
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,909
When's the reopening
ceremony scheduled for?

696
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:10,644
9:58, to coincide
with the arrival

697
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,379
of the first high speed train
from Central City.

698
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:13,547
Let's suit up.

699
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,182
You should suit up, too.

700
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,583
What?

701
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,498
Get me closer.

702
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,999
I'm trying.

703
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,907
Everybody
get out of here.

704
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:07,175
It's not safe.

705
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,717
Out of the way,
out of the way, out of the way.

706
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:23,158
Whoa. You're
really strong.

707
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,326
Go.

708
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:25,760
This is SCPD.

709
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:30,131
Everyone quickly
and quietly evacuate the station.

710
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,891
Everyone move calmly
towards the exits. Calmly.

711
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:39,908
The train is 10 minutes out.

712
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,244
6 minutes till
safest blast radius.

713
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,660
Oof!

714
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,099
Situation report.

715
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:08,870
Mr. Slater.

716
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:12,707
Sorry. He had to get off
at an earlier stop.

717
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:17,112
You can't be the Arrow,
he died. So who are you?

718
00:34:17,114 --> 00:34:19,214
You're about to
find out.

719
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:23,118
Stop the train.

720
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,586
No, I don't want to.

721
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:26,821
Even if I did,
I couldn't.

722
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:29,424
I destroyed the braking system
20 miles ago.

723
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:32,093
Willing to die to destroy
a train station?

724
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,561
No, that would be
ridiculous.

725
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:35,597
Then how are you planning on
getting off the train?

726
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,799
Oh, you don't know
who I am, do you?

727
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:42,637
I'm Damian Darhk.

728
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:05,126
Whoo!

729
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,129
Is that all you got?

730
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:13,635
Ahh!

731
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:18,506
It seems you've much
in common with the Arrow.

732
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:19,974
You're both dead.

733
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,345
Oh!

734
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:32,754
Thank you.

735
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:37,392
We need to stop the train.

736
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:38,460
Got any ideas?

737
00:35:38,462 --> 00:35:41,162
Yeah, blow it up.

738
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:58,980
Ooh.

739
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,742
So what are you
gonna call yourself now?

740
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:08,677
Everybody thinks Roy
was the Arrow.

741
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:11,947
He won't need a code
name if he's headed back to Ivy town.

742
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:18,086
Well, then I guess
I need a code name.

743
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:21,423
Felicity and I,
we have missed this.

744
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:22,991
We've missed all of you.

745
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:26,361
And the city is far
worse off than we thought.

746
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:27,596
What are you talking about?

747
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:29,431
The man leading the
ghost is Damian Darhk.

748
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,200
Darhk left Star City
months ago.

749
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:32,434
Why would he come back?

750
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:33,769
Did Rra's tell you
anything about Darhk

751
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:35,337
that would give us
any idea about his agenda?

752
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:39,475
He said that Damian Darhk had a
hive of operatives

753
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:40,476
at his disposal.

754
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:41,677
A hive?

755
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,479
That was the exact word
he used?

756
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,447
Yes. Why?

757
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:47,716
Does it mean
something to you?

758
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:49,184
Who would want to kill Andy?

759
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:53,055
Don't know their names,
just an alias.

760
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,456
HIVE.

761
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,792
No.

762
00:36:57,962 --> 00:36:59,261
No, nothing.

763
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:00,596
You all right?
Yeah, yeah.

764
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,464
I'm fine, man.
I'm just beat.

765
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:05,067
Plus, I have a little girl
to tuck in.

766
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:07,135
John.

767
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:08,270
John.

768
00:37:08,272 --> 00:37:09,471
Listen, I'm, um,

769
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:11,607
I'm not quite there yet,
Oliver,

770
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,375
so let's not do this
right now.

771
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:15,344
No, I know.
I get it.

772
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:18,080
But there is something we do
need to do.

773
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:21,350
Captain, new problem.
Seriously?

774
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:23,485
Someone's hacked into
the emergency broadcast system.

775
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,287
They've taken over
all the networks.

776
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,123
6 months ago, the Arrow died.

777
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:31,293
But what he stood for didn't.

778
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:35,931
It lived on in the heroes
who took up his mantle.

779
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:38,267
People who believe
that this city

780
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:41,103
should never descend
into hopelessness.

781
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:44,306
Who believe although light
is full of darkness,

782
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:48,110
that darkness can be
the key to find light.

783
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:51,647
And tonight,
I am declaring my intention

784
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,482
to stand with them,

785
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:56,818
to fight for this city,

786
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,156
to be the symbol of hope
that the Arrow never was.

787
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:09,765
I am the Green Arrow.

788
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,150
Who are you?

789
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,485
Answer me.

790
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:09,391
Kanjigar septum
vohnostrum.

791
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:23,839
You have
a visitor.

792
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,616
Sorry about the arm.

793
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:36,985
Unnecessary subterfuge
to prevent anyone

794
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:39,621
from suspecting
your involvement with the HIVE.

795
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:40,722
What do you want?

796
00:39:40,724 --> 00:39:42,257
Well, I'm a little
disappointed

797
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:44,393
the train station isn't
a smoldering pile of ash.

798
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:47,562
I'm not.
Mass murder, killing innocents.

799
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:48,864
I didn't sign up
for this.

800
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,465
You signed up to follow
my instructions,

801
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,067
to do my will.

802
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:53,902
I want to know everything
about this Green Arrow,

803
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:55,303
where he lives,
and who he loves,

804
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:56,738
and I want him off
the boards by the time

805
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,073
my associates arrive.

806
00:39:58,075 --> 00:40:00,475
And if I don't help you?

807
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:01,910
Well, then I would
be surprised.

808
00:40:01,912 --> 00:40:04,246
'Cause I think I made it
abundantly clear

809
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,715
you don't have
a choice.

810
00:40:10,554 --> 00:40:13,055
So my guilt
for displacing Thea

811
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:15,891
is only slightly
outweighed

812
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:19,294
by how amazing
this place is.

813
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,631
Thea's actually been
living with Laurel

814
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:23,965
for the past few months.

815
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,167
Oh.

816
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:28,103
Ra's stabbed her
right over there.

817
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,104
Oh.

818
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:30,505
We can get a rug.

819
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:32,974
You know, I'd hate
to disappoint you,

820
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:36,311
but that speech
is pretty hopeful.

821
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:37,913
Why would that
disappoint me?

822
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:40,449
Oh, you know how you
said you didn't know

823
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:43,118
how to be a hero
without the darkness?

824
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,656
And I know how you hate
being wrong.

825
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,847
Sorry I missed
the funeral.

826
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:15,150
Zoom?
Yeah.

827
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:16,985
There was a time I would have
thought this was my fault,

828
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:20,055
that I brought this
darkness upon us.

829
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:22,090
Now I know it's not
my fault.

830
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:23,825
It's my responsibility.

831
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:26,328
Responsibility
to do what?

832
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,764
To end it.

833
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:29,998
I'm gonna kill him.

834
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,200
Is there anything
I can do?

835
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:34,669
I want to be left alone.

836
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:36,071
Ok.

837
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:05,231
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

838
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,996
Greg!
Move your head.
