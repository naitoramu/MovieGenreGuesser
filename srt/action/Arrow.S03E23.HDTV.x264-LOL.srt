Start talking!

216
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:42,775
The reason that I have

217
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:44,443
kept Malcolm close
for the past several months

218
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:46,646
is because he had
critical Intel on our enemy.

219
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:49,282
He knows Ra's.
He knows the League.

220
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:51,784
And he knew that if I was
appointed his successor,

221
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:54,520
that meant Starling City
was marked for death.

222
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:56,989
The only way that we were
going to defeat the League

223
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:58,724
was from the inside.

224
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:01,594
I had to get close enough to Ra's
to find out how he was

225
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:02,962
going to destroy
the city...

226
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,264
And stop him.

you did the two people closest to you!

John, it wasn't
about trust!

229
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:12,772
It was about making sure that
you and you were safe.

230
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:15,775
I had to keep the circle
as small as possible.

231
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:18,144
How did you expect to repair all this
once you got back?

232
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:20,379
I didn't.

233
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:23,382
I flew with Ra's
and the virus to Starling

234
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,718
and I sabotaged the plane.

235
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,555
The plan...

236
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,490
was to kill Ra's
and destroy the virus.

237
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:32,925

238

You never expected
to have this conversation.

You were planning
on dying.

242
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,641
So that was your big plan.

243
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,031
Sacrificing yourself
to take out Ra's.

244
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:58,311
It's the only way.

that it didn't work,

246

to contact her father.

If Ra's is here
with the virus,

268
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,158
why hasn't he
used it yet?

269

Where are we?

270
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:31,928
Nowhere. Ra's
is old school.

Every way I have
of finding him is new school.

Oliver, maybe we need
to change the way we're looking for him.

273
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,202
If we're trying to find
a sub that's gone dark,

274
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,370
we should look
for what's out

of the ordinary
in the water.

276
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,339
So we look
for what's unusual

277
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,908
and maybe
that points us

278
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,143
to how or where

00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,459

my employer unawares.

[Cell phone vibrating]

328
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,197
It's just my phone.

329
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,072
Ra's: Hello, Al Sah-him.

330
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,908
Apparently both our plans
did not go as we'd hoped.

331
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,610
I'm going to find you.

332
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,446
It was a bold gambit,
hoping to leverage Mr. Darhk,

333
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,281
but one which had
done you no good.

334
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,650
I set in motion
the death of your city

335
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,452
10 minutes ago.

336
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:47,090
The Alpha Omega shall be
disseminated by means of four vessels.

337
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,792
Four instruments of death.

338
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:52,929
And I doubt that you and your friends
will have time to stop all of them.

339
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,098
Unlike you,
Oliver Queen,

340
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,200
I'm a man of my word.

341
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,803
And I swore that
you would see your city perish.

342
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:08,941
I told you I needed
the DD-5 for the Andreyko case

343
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:12,281
on my desk, and unless
I recently went blind, they're not here!

344
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:13,611
Now what--

345
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,146
I got to put you
on hold for a second.

346
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:18,482
Won't be long.

347
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,984
I thought you and I agreed

348
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,486
to give ourselves
some space.

349
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:23,954
Not when the city's
in danger.

350

[Scoffs]
I don't have time for this.

351
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,891
Wait. Do you remember
that chemical spill

352
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:29,426
in Hong Kong
five years ago?

353
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:31,628
It turns out, it was
a biological attack

354
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,775
and that bioweapon--

355
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,799
Let me guess.

356
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,233
This is coming
from your buddy Queen, right?

357
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:37,300
The city's under attack?
Must be May?

358
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,402
What do--

359
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:40,770
You still keep it in
the middle drawer?

360
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:41,510
What?

361
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:43,174
The bottle?

362
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,809
I'm going to bet
that it's scotch.

363
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,014
It's not what
you think it is.

364
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:52,716
Don't.

365
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,219
If you want to drink,
then drink.

366
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,623
But don't just stand
there and lie to me right to my face.

367
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,224
Doesn't feel good, does it?

368
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:02,859
It makes you thirsty.

369
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:05,629
I love you.

370
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:08,765
No matter what happens between us,
that'll never change.

371
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,600
You can hate me
for lying;

372
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:12,402
you can blame
Oliver for Sara,

373
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:14,905
you can even blame me.

374
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,940
But falling off the wagon,
that's on you.

375
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,308
I got it under control,
all right?

376
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,710
It's two drinks
a day and that's it.

377

We're alcoholics,
dad! Drunks!

378
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:24,814
There's no such thing
as two drinks a day.

379
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:27,784
And now you have
a choice.

380
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:29,886
You can keep drinking
and keep being angry

381
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:31,688
at me and Oliver
or the rest

382
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,390
of the world,
if you want.

383
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,626
Or you can make both
of your daughters proud

384
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:40,063
and throw away
the bottle and help save the city.

John, Malcolm, and Nyssa
are on their way back.

386

What happened with Darhk?

387
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,841
He was gone.

388
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,776
Man that I found
was a cut-out.

389
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:56,280
Ra's plans to release the virus
at four points across the city.

390
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,181
I worked out a containment
system that can safely neutralize the virus,

391
00:20:58,183 --> 00:20:59,849
if we can get
our hands on it.

392
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,685
Well, we need
four of them,

393
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:03,620
and a way to spread
the inoculant if this gets out of control.

394
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:05,755
I scrubbed through all the information
that Malcolm gave us

395
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:07,424
on the Hong Kong attack
five years ago.

396
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:09,227
The Alpha Omega virus
gave off a low level

397
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,194
emission from its RNA,
almost like radiation.

398
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:12,796
If you can hack
the keyhole hexagon satellite,

399
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:14,531
you can tune the quadband
to search for it...

400
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,032
Which you've been
doing for the last five minutes.

401
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:18,068
We need probable
locations

402
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,302
where he would
release the virus

403
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,569
as soon as you can get them.

404
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,594
Mm-hmm.

All I know...

409
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,322
is I wasn't strong enough

410
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,424
to save my son.

411
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:45,629
Or to do what Oliver did.

412
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:48,098
What Oliver did
was horrible.

413
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,201
He allowed himself
to become a monster.

414
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:53,770
No more of a monster
than I am.

415

without a soul, Tatsu.

417

Only if you
abandon your wife

418
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,947
when she needs you
the most.

419

Every time...

420
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:10,287
I look in your eyes...

421
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,256
I see my son's.

422
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,925
I see my failure.

423
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,394
I love you.

424
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:20,130
I'm not worthy of that love.

Where's he going?

426
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:32,976
Somewhere we
cannot follow.

427
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:43,320
I know I said I would never,
ever bring you coffee again,

a bioweapon attack

430
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:50,427
seemed like
a valid exception.

431
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:57,601
So your plan to take out
Ra's by dying...

432
00:22:57,602 --> 00:23:01,137
We should talk about that.

433
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:03,273
Every night since
the mountain,

434
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:04,841
I've had the same dream.

You are pleading
with me not to go face Ra's,

436
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,746
and I listen to you.

437
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,815
Sometimes the dream
still ends badly;

438
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:15,452
I end up with this
sword in my chest.

439
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:17,821
But most of the time,

440
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:19,489
we escape.

00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:24,127
And we're just driving.

442
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:27,497
And all this seems...

443
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:30,166
it seems so far away,

444

that's not possible,

he only realistic best case scenario.

Both those men tried and both
those men failed.

your best efforts,

that's a weakness; It's not.

It's your key

00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:40,224
I want to be with you.

647
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:44,195
You told me that I have
become someone else,

648
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:47,098
and I would like to...

649
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,569
maybe discover a little more
about that person.

650
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:54,238
If you'll come with me.

651
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,307
With you where?

652
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:58,376
Um...

653
00:35:58,378 --> 00:36:01,245
Some place
far away from here.

654
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,381
Even without me,

655
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:06,384
Starling still has heroes
to watch over it.

656
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:10,254
John...

657
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:12,757
I'll talk to him.

658
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,584
Wow.

659
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:20,799
Yeah.

660
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,201
That's the word I've been
saying over and over in my head.

661
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:28,106
So, does that mean I'm going
to have to find

662
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:30,742
a new vice president?

663
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:33,211
I think so.

664
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:36,414
I hope that you find someone
who makes you happy, Ray.

665
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:40,084
You deserve that.

666
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:46,930
John?

667
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,994
I'm happy for you, Oliver.

668
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,528
Despite our issues,

669
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,804
you deserve to be happy.
You and Felicity.

670
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:56,092
And you're right,
the city's in good hands.

671
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:57,057
Including yours.

672
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,578
I'm no superhero.

673
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:01,113
You're a hero.

674
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:03,581
For three years,
you've been a rock.

675
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,850
The city's rock, my rock.

676
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:08,386
For three years,
you have been the person

677
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:11,235
I can count on.

678
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:12,702
I'm still counting on you.

679
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,593
Oliver, I don't know
if I can get past

680
00:37:15,594 --> 00:37:17,327
what happened
between the two of us.

681
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:20,097
I'm not asking you to.

682
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,199
I'll think on it.

683
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,634
Ok.

684

[Elevator dings]

685
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:32,409
John.

686

[Clears throat] If you're going
to keep going,

687
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:37,381
you may want to find
a way to conceal your identity

688
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,683
when you're out there.

689
00:37:39,685 --> 00:37:42,986
I'll think on that, too.

690
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:45,088
[Elevator dings]

691
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,669
You be well, Oliver.

692
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:48,693
You, too.

693
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,032
Oliver: Where will you go?

694
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:57,267
Tatsu: Kumamoto.

695
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:58,902
There's
a monastery there

696
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,871
near my childhood home.

697
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:03,340
I had always hoped
to show it to Akio

698
00:38:03,342 --> 00:38:05,909
when we returned to
Japan as a family.

699
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:08,345
I'm so very sorry, Tatsu.

700
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:12,649
And where
will you go?

701
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:14,718
Back to
Starling City?

702
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,887
No, I...

703
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:21,124
I tortured Shrieve
for hours.

704
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:25,028
I don't want that darkness around
my mother or my sister.

705
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,864
What of your father?

706
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:28,832
You told me about
his message.

707
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,969
His hope that you would
save your city.

708
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:35,739
I'm not the man
my father thinks I am.

709
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:37,908
Even if I was, I...

710
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,677
I should be alone.

711
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:43,013
I need to be alone.

712
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,656
Be well, Tatsu.

713
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:06,904
He's upstairs,

714
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:08,939
packing.

715
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:11,675
I'll be leaving
Starling as well.

716
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:16,079
Try to imagine
my profound disappointment.

717
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:18,015
Thea, I love you.

718
00:39:18,017 --> 00:39:20,317
I know my actions
always haven't shown that.

719
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,820
But I am your father.

720
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,390
And whatever you need,

721
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,191
I will always
be there for you.

722
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:31,028
Yeah, well, don't
wait by the phone.

723
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,097
But, a year ago,

724
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:38,702
you told me that you could
teach me to be strong.

725
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:41,838
You've made good
by that promise.

[Footsteps on stairs]

727

God, are you sure
you really want to do this?

728
00:39:49,548 --> 00:39:51,715
As sure as I was
the last five times you asked me.

729
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:52,883
[Sighs]

730
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,485
Be safe out there, ok?

731
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:59,389
As safe as anybody
with a mask on can be.

732
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:03,594
But, actually,
I was thinking, um,

733
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:07,698
maybe I'll call myself
the Red Arrow?

734
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,633
Hmm.

735
00:40:09,635 --> 00:40:12,536
I think I already told everyone
to call you Speedy.

736
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,605
[Chuckles]

737
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:27,718
As we agreed.

738
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:33,690
We've come a long way,
you and I.

739
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:37,561
I've always looked
at you as a son, Oliver.

740
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:40,897
And I'm glad we got
to work together

741
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,766
to trust as we did.

742
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:46,870
I will never
forgive you

743
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:49,840
for what you did
to Sara.

744
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:53,343
And my sister.

745
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:55,646
Ever.

746
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,748
Does that mean
we're enemies once more?

747
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,151
That depends on what you do
with your end of the bargain.

breakthrough

751
00:41:19,772 --> 00:41:21,638
while repurposing
nanotechnology

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,807
for anti-viral
dissemination.

753
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:26,576
With the proper
modifications,

754
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:29,546
the nanotech can be applied
to the miniaturization of key components

755
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:32,149
of the suit.

756
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:36,787
This will be miniaturization
test number one.

Execute.

758

Why can't anything
ever work the first try?

00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:46,496
Hmm?

760
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:17,761
At least admit this was
your goal all along.

761
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:21,531
My only aspiration was to free myself
of your father's grasp.

00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:25,469
A feat we both
managed to achieve.

763
00:42:25,471 --> 00:42:28,171
I don't see how it was
possible in your case.

764
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,140
When I was your father's captive
three months ago,

765
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:32,776
he tortured me
with his blade.

766
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:36,079
And you survived because my father
chose to release you.

Funny thing,

Fate and my father
have shown you mercy.

I will not.

770
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:45,021
You took Sara from me,
and I will have justice.

You are
welcome to try.

to save my city.

And I did.

779
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,026
I became a hero
who helped people.

780
00:43:23,028 --> 00:43:25,317
But now it is time
for me to be someone else.

781
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:28,652
It is time for me
to be...something else.

782
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:35,993
So, where are we going?

783
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:38,863
I'm thinking a state
that can annul
