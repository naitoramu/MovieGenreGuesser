HOSTESS:
Hi.

7
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,526
Welcome to Endless Pasta Week
at Tony Cicero's.

8
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,070
Where the fuck am I?

9
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,488
You're at Tony Cicero's.

10
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,657
No, no.
What fucking city am I in?

11
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,283
Uh, Fort Wayne.

12
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,993
The fuck?

13
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,746
You got a bit of paper,
something I can write with?

14
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,039
A pen, anything.

15
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,874
(muttering):
Ah, fuck it.

16
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,168
(indistinct chatter)

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,963
NEWS ANCHOR:
Yesterday, it closed

18
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,173
at ten percent below
its record high,

19
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,551
set last month.

20
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,178
Federal authorities have
initiated a multistate manhunt

21
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,682
for William Butcher
for allegedly murdering

22
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,184
Vought Vice President
Madelyn Stillwell

23
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,437
as well as endangering
her infant son, Theodore.

24
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,107
Law enforcement officials
have set up a tip line

25
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,693
and are urging anyone
with information

26
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,154
regarding the suspect's
whereabouts to come forward.

27
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,157
Police are also asking...

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,083

"Boy, girl."

31
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,231
I am sorry.

32
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,066
I do not understand.

33
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,659
All right, I'm off.

34
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,912
-HUGHIE: Where you going?
-Going to meet a contact.

35
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,622
Who?

36
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,416
Someone who can help us find
this Supe terrorist cunt.

37
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,626
Who is the contact?

38
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,669
What is their actual name?

39
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,757
-You'll love it.
-No, I won't.

40
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,717
I won't love it.
I never love it.

41
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,093
I never fucking love it!

42
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,639
Noted.

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,182
Not a word from him.

44
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,851
He left us for dead, and now
it's like nothing happened?

45
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,151
You're right.

46
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,153
I am sorry.

47
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,073
Sorry that I trusted this lot
was smart enough

48
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,992
to save themselves like they've
done a hundred times before.

49
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,369
Okay, well, where you been?

50
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,788
Well, technically,
I called him back.

51
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,957
He blew up Madelyn Stillwell.

52
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,585
I told you. She was already dead
when I blew her up.

53
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,963
Oh. Great. Cool.

54
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,632
Totally. We're just gonna
pretend like this is normal?

55
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,258
Like we're fucking lemmings?

56
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,480
Well, who else
they gonna follow?

57
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,572
Right.

58
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,624
(birds chirping)

59
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,501
(grunts)

60
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,462
(laughs softly)

61
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,090
Hey. You know, my dad,

62
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,051
he had a ball
from the '56 World Series.

63
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,970
Signed by Don Larsen himself.

64
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,972
Pitched a no-hitter in Game 5.

65
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,598
Really?

66
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,268
Pretty cool, huh?

67
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,438
Ooh. That's okay. Uh...

68
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,648
You'll, uh,
you'll get the next one.

69
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,525
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

70
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,152
RYAN:
Yeah, I'll get the next one.

71
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,905
(sighs)

72
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,741
Okay.

73
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,036
Ryan. Use your powers.

74
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,328
What do you mean?

75
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,502
RYAN:
Huh.

76
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,795
I can't do that.

77
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,923
Yes, you can. You're my son.

78
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:46,472
Has anyone told you
what you're capable of?

79
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,516
No.

80
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,396
Well, then it's about time
you found out.

81
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,274
BECCA:
Hey, Ryan? Come on.
Math time, buddy.

82
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,901
Chapters 12 and 13
in your workbook.

83
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,486
(exhales)
Yeah.

84
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,571
Math, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

85
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,573
BECCA:
It's your favorite.

86
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,325
Be in in a minute, okay?

87
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,993
HOMELANDER:
You know, when I was his age,

88
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,080
I was breaking
the sound barrier.

89
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,290
He can't even throw a fastball.

90
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,958
We thought it was best
that he have

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,503
as ordinary
of a childhood as possible.

92
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,505
We?

93
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,381
-Who's we?
-Look,

94
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,093
I just want my kid to be normal.

95
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,430
Well, then,
it's a good thing I'm here.

96
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,599
'Cause my son
is the furthest fucking thing

97
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,602
on this planet
to a normal little boy.

98
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,438
How long are you planning
on staying?

99
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,609
Becca, we had a deal.

100
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,986
A deal that is alive and well

101
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,573
and-and running around
as free as a goddam bird.

102
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,035
So, let's just

103
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,829
try and be civil, shall we?

104
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,724
Did I get 'em right?

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,603
There's...

106
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,773
There's no correct
or incorrect answer.

107
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,525
Oh.

108
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,821
What is missing here?

109
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,076
DEEP:
Uh...

110
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,207
Deep, how do you expect to be
welcomed back into The Seven

111
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,293
if you can't be honest
with yourself?

112
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,379
Carol, if I'm being honest,

113
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,339
I don't know
what the fuck you want from me.

114
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,465
(door closes)

115
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,552
Hey, guys.

116
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,845
How's it going?

117
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,889
Can I have a word?

118
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,809
I don't mean to be negative,

119
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:00,022
but his operating perspective
is functionally nonexistent.

120
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,232
(whispering): I don't think
there's a path here.

121
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,443
Leave it to me.

122
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,861
(tea kettle whistling)

123
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,821
EAGLE:
See, you're just inhibited

124
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,240
by suppressive energy,
that's it.

125
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,492
Just got to realign things.

126
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,494
What is it? Shrooms?

127
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,372
Last time I did shrooms was
at a Goo Goo Dolls concert

128
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,209
with some poli sci chick
from Oberlin.

129
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,713
I guess I'd call it more
of a gateway.

130
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,054
(coughs sharply, chuckles)

131
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,766
Wait.
Are you not gonna drink any?

132
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,603
No. Deep, this is your journey.

133
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,903
STARLIGHT:
Who's revving up the girl power
in The Seven?

134
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,947
Keep watching, WDCS,

00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,158
Cleveland's first

Quiet, please.
Going again. On the bell.

137
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,578
-(bell rings)
-MAN 2: Rolling.

138
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,372
Where should I start?
Are you ready

139
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,123
to meet the newest member
of The Seven?

140
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,125
See it here first, WFAK.

141
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,794
KMFT. WDCS.

142
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,462
-WOMAN: Cut!
-(bell rings)
-Quiet please. Still rolling.

143
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,130
She's the newest member
of The Seven,

144
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,007
and she's taking America
by storm.

145
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,509
From Portland to Seattle.

146
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,552
Watch what comes next, KMFT.

147
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,888
ASHLEY:
Amazing.

148
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,390
Do you need to take a break,

149
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,891
or can we power
through the rest?

150
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,643
Let's just power through.

151
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,812
-(camera shutters clicking)
-(cheering, indistinct chatter)

152
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,107
WOMAN:
Hey, over here!
Give us a shot! Gorgeous!

153
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,484
-(camera shutters clicking)
-Starlight! Oh!

154
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,570
-Stormfront, over here!
-Stormfront, show us
what you got!

155
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,823
-We're ready!
-(reporters oohing)

156
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,075
-(whooping and cheering)
-(laughs)

157
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,910
ASHLEY:
Okay, ladies,

158
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,371
we have a big day--
domestic outlets until noon,

159
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,581
ten minutes each,
foreign until 2:00.

160
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,376
Round tables until 4:00,
print one-on-ones until 6:00.

161
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,169
Jesus,
if she vibrates any faster,

162
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,380
-that stick up her ass
is gonna explode.
-(laughs)

163
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,132
-(phone buzzing)
-We really should
be powering through.

164
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,758
We don't have time.

165
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,969
Hello?

166
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,725
What?

167
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,768
When?

168
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,523
Okay. Thank you.

169
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,358
ASHLEY:
We're going positive,
we're going female,

170
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,943
thoughtful but upbeat.

171
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,862
-Where... What?
-MAEVE: I gotta go.

172
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,698
-What? No.
-I'm sorry. Family emergency.

173
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,116
-Is everything okay?
-Maeve,

174
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,118
we've never had three women
in The Seven before.

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,871
This is a moment. Girls get it
done. You are not...!

176
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,292
I have a family emergency, too.

177
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,129
PASTOR:
A reading
from the Book of Revelations.

178
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,007
"And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes,

179
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,633
and there will be
no more death."

180
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,011
Today, we say goodbye
to Susan Raynor.

181
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,432
For though her body rests, her
soul lives on for all eternity.

182
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,601
And one day,
you will think of Susan

183
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,103
with joy as well as sadness.

184
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,106
They are two sides of a coin
you will carry forever.

185
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,611
And you are blessed
to have your family

186
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,821
and your friends
to help you carry it.

187
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,157
In the name of Christ. Amen.

188
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,161
(two beeps)

189
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,291
(sighs)

190
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,919
You think you can surprise me?

191
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,089
I literally taught you this one.

192
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,511
Hello, Grace.

193
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,513
You promised
I'd never see you again.

194
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,224
I promised...

195
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,518
not to come to your house again.

196
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,940
A subtle
but important distinction.

197
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,067
I assume
you sent the edible arrangement?

198
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,527
Deluxe Bereavement Bouquet

199
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,779
with white chocolate-dipped
pineapple doves.

200
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,115
Raynor would have loved that.

201
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,620
Oi, where you going?

202
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,539
There are about
two dozen federal officers

203
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,374
in the church next door.

204
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,127
I'm gonna turn you in for the
murder of Madelyn Stillwell.

205
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,754
Oh, come off it, Grace.
You really think I done that?

206
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,589
You really want me
to answer that?

207
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,467
Grace, I know who killed Raynor!

208
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,682
Who?

209
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,017
Okay, well, uh,
I don't specifically,

210
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,563
technically have the answer to
that, but I know how to get it.

211
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,359
We think Vought killed her for
getting too close to something.

212
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,652
Getting too close to what?

213
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,070
Something to do
with a Supe terrorist

214
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,697
smuggled into Jersey
a couple of nights ago,

215
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,991
-and that is where we start.
-(laughing): Honestly,

216
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,702
it's like asking a cockroach
to not be a cockroach.

217
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,287
It's just your nature.

218
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,038
I know what she meant to you,
all right?

219
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,124
We find this terrorist,
and we're one step closer

220
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,584
to finding out who offed her.

221
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm not getting back in.

222
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,378
And if I were, which I'm not,

223
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,005
it sure as shit wouldn't be
for you.

224
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,591
Oh, I ain't asking you
all the way back in.

225
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,634
Just dip in a little toe, yeah?

226
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,762
Maybe two.
Not for me. For Raynor.

227
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,598
You never gave a shit
about Susan.

228
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,141
You're only here
because you're desperate,

229
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,934
fucked, and you want something.

230
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,896
All right, fuck it.
Grace? Grace!

231
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,191
Grace, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

232
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,151
I'll level with you, okay?

233
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,862
(exhales)
Just hear me out.

234
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,906
(panting)

235
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,828
(singing along): ♪ I just want
you to know who I am ♪

236
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,247
-♪ I just want... ♪
-MALE VOICE (muffled): Hey.

237
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,833
♪ To know who I am ♪

238
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:16,004
♪ I just want you
to know who I am ♪

239
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,381
-Hey.
-♪ I just want you... ♪

240
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,300
(music stops)

241
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,010
Eagle?

242
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,804
-Hey!
-(gasps)

243
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,266
In here. Open up.

244
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,229
(breathing heavily)

245
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,532
Bro, we got to talk.

246
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,203
-No, you got to look at us.
-(quietly): No.

247
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,997
Look at us!

248
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,416
(breathing deeply)

249
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,463
(quietly):
Okay.

250
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,007
Remember Melissa Dabrowski,

251
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,635
the kindergarten teacher
you fingerbanged backstage

252
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,929
at the VH1 Educator Awards?

253
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,264
So what?

254
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,641
You were supposed to present her
with Teacher of the Year,

255
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,978
but you bailed while she was
pulling her panties back on.

256
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,188
Yeah, because she laughed at me.

257
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,523
Okay, bullshit.

258
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,066
She just put her hands
on your chest.

259
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,776
You never even unzipped
your suit.

260
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:20,902
She would have laughed.

261
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,737
Because that's what you do.

262
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,074
You imagine women will laugh at
us, so you humiliate them first.

263
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,784
No, that's-that's not true.

264
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,288
You can't accept your own body,
so you violate theirs.

265
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,790
(stammers)
Shut the fuck up.

266
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,625
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

267
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,628
(panting)
Hey. Hey. Hey.

268
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,880
(chuckles)

269
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,591
-You can't swim from us forever!
-Let me out!

270
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,093
You shut the fuck up,
you ugly pieces of shit.

271
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,095
I have nothing else
to say to you.

272
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,306
-We won't let you shut us up
anymore, Kevin!
-(whimpering)

273
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,725
Hey. Hey! Hey!

274
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,977
Let me out, man.
Just let me out!

275
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,314
-Eagle!
-(door rattling)

276
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,690
-Let me out, man!
-(slams against door)

277
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,317
Ride it, brother.

278
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,360
(siren wails in distance)

279
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,796
(sighs)

280
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,551
What are you doing here?

281
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,306
Apparently, your work...

282
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,726
still has "Maggie Shaw"
as your emergency contact.

283
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,687
Ah, shit. Sorry.

284
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,731
That's okay.

285
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,902
Where else would I score
this sweet jelly?

286
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,945
(Elena laughs)

287
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,449
I thought it was bad unagi.

288
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,035
Turns out,
my appendix was about to burst.

289
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,288
Well, there are easier ways
to get my attention.

290
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,876
I kept thinking you'd call.

291
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,214
Yeah. Me, too.

292
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,050
-You want me to call your mom?
-(laughs)

293
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:10,428
Definitely not.
(groans)

294
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,641
Someone else,
like a girlfriend, or...?

295
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,893
Seriously, thanks for coming,

296
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,020
but I'm sure you have
more important places to be.

297
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,981
Hey, you could die
from something like this.

298
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,651
But I didn't, so I guess
you don't need to save me.

299
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,529
Yeah, well, I still want
to see the doctor.

300
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,573
Maeve, I'm fine, I promise.

301
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,080
(Elena sighs)

302
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,874
You know, watching Botched
doesn't make you

303
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,794
-a fucking medical expert.
-(scoffs)

304
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,630
I'll wait a while
and just see, okay?

305
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,675
Can we get this middle chair out
of here, please?

306
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,093
Yeah. Somebody?
Thank you. Thank you.

307
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,761
Can we get the two on the side
just smushed together?

308
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,805
We lost one of them.

309
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,724
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Okay,
resetting; one background.

310
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,600
-All right, people,
quiet on the set.
-Rolling.

311
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,519
Well, Stormfront,
congrats on The Seven.

312
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,438
Are you as excited to be here
as I am?

313
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,565
I don't know!
I don't think so!

314
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,483
(chuckles)
Can you tell us a little

315
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,901
about how girls get it done?

316
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,902
REPORTER 3:
...girls get it done?

317
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,987
REPORTER 4:
...girls get it done?

318
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,155
REPORTER 5:
...girls get it done?

319
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,197
Let's dish boys.

320
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,907
Starlight, single?
Or, uh, spoken for?

321
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,200
Uh, single, single.

322

Uh, single.

323
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,163
Definitely single.
(chuckles)

324
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,874
Tell us how fun it is
to have all this girl power.

Can you repeat that but say

326
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:27,130
"strong is the new pretty"
right at the end?

327
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,423
Do girls make better heroes?

328
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,425

I-I get you have
your talking points,

332
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,350

heroes have a dick or a vag?

333
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,228

all just, you know, be competent

334
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,772
at our jobs?

335
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,940
I-I don't think
girls do anything better.

336
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,942
I think chicks and dicks
are in it together.

Sorry, Ashy.

341
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,246
Vought won't let me have pockets
in this thing.

You can see every crease
in my ass.

You can practically see

344
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,585
You want to talk
about girl power,

345
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,420
let's talk
about getting some pockets.

347
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,423
Starlight,
your teammate, A-Train,

348
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,425
has been out of the public eye.

349
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,011
-Mm-hmm.
-Vought recently revealed

350
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,931
that he was on a top secret
mission in Kandahar.

351
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,265
Are you worried about him?

352
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,017
(clears throat)
Yeah, of course.

353
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,019
I pray for him every night.

354
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,605
(inhales)
America really is lucky

355
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,024
to have such a brave hero
fighting for them.

356
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,859

357
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,402

493
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,353
So, in short, do not waste
your hard-earned cash

494
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,438
on this shitty,
big-titted hunk of plastic

495
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,357
that'll probably end up
in a manatee's belly

496
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,485
when your kid chucks it
in the garbage.

497
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,445
Hey. Um...

498
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,031
I just got to say,

499
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:35,618
I really like everything that
you've been saying about Vought.

500
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,994
Yeah, okay, cool.

501
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,412
No, I mean...

502
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,164
I agree with you.

503
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,500
You wearing a wire or something?

504
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,043
What? What does that have to...

505
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,671
Look, I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

506
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,048
but I don't need
some fucking Vought Spy Barbie

507
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,092
sniffing around to see
whether I'm a team player.

508
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,552
What? That is

509
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,097
not at all what I am.

510
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,515
I used to be a fan.

511
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,267
But look at you.

512
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:03,312
You're like the Voughtiest
Vought in all Vought.

513
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,029
I think, uh, cyclops dude's
trying to get your attention.

514
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,699
(quietly):
Fuck.

515
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,617
What happened to your eye?

516
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,786
Oh, Vought is testing
a new volumizing

517
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,788
dry shampoo for eye irritation.

518
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,540
As if you give a fuck.

519
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,750
Here.

520
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,794
I brought you a sample.

521
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,257
Are you kidding me?

522
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,883
I can't take this right now.

523
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,260
I can't get away
from this press junket.

524
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,887
I literally have no pockets.

525
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,222
You wanted the V, here it is.

526
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,849
If you threaten me again,
I'm gonna make sure

527
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,642
that everyone knows
that you're the one who took it.

528
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,686
Uh...

529
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,650
-A-TRAIN: You're tight
with Gecko?
-Hey.

530
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,695
Yeah, it--
From Capes for Christ,

531
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,780
back in the day. Yeah.

532
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,449
Yeah.

533
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,034
What'd you just put
in your boot?

534
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,369
What? Nothing.

535
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,540
'Cause it looked like you
just put something in your boot.

536
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:08,836
Why don't you tell me
what's in my boot?

537
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,271
(exhales)

538
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,483
Maybe... you shouldn't
be hitting the Cristal

539
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,486
with your buddies quite so soon.

540
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,904
Come on.

541
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,073
Let's finish dick-tickling
these half-wits

542
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,617
so we can finally do
our real job.

543
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,080
Shall we?

544
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,835
BECCA:
All right, kiddo.

545
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,295
Here we are.

546
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,713
Have a great lesson.

547
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,507
Yeah.

548
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,302
Okay, I'll be back in an hour.

549
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm gonna go have coffee
with Ms. Bird.

550
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,932
Yeah. Um, thanks.

551
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,475

I understand this is upsetting.

571
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,015
I was told I would never have
to see him ever again,

572
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,892
that he would never know
about Ryan or me.

That was the deal.

Homelander is quite upset
that this information

575
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,188
was concealed from him.

576
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,439
Corporate has made a decision

577
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,982
not to antagonize him further.

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,237
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan

581
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,655
and I'm gonna run,

582
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,033
and you'll never fucking find us
ever again.

583
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,119
I think we both know
that that's not possible.

584
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,041
You have to protect us.

585
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,375
You have...

586
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,294
You have to move us, please.

587
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,213
I'm sorry.
Now that he knows,

588
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,757
there's just no putting the
toothpaste back in the tube.

589
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,050
You should probably
be getting back.

590
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,718
Piano lessons are almost done.

591
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,386
Just keep him calm.

592
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,721
Our best guess--

593
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,348
he'll get bored and move on.

594
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,768
You-you don't know that.

595

You don't.

596
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,322

MAEVE:
Maybe.

598
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,700
What will you trade me for it?

599
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,746
I will let you
take me out to dinner.

600
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,834
Right.

601
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,295
I forgot.
We'll need to order in,

602
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,798
keep it low-pro.

603
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,801
Maeve, what are you doing here
if nothing has changed?

604
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,971
(laughs):
Oh, Christ.

605
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,641
The last thing that woman needs
is another nose job.

606
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,102
Okay. We've done
this dance, thanks.

607
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,438
-Elena...
-It's time to go.

608
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,692
(takes deep breath)

609
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,250
Homelander and I went
to this Oscar party

610
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,294
for 12 Years a Slave.

611
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,213
There was this producer,
he swapped place cards

612
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,007
so he could sit next to me.

613
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,925
And he chatted me up all night.

614
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:28,137
Two days later,
there's a fire in his office.

615
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,599
They found his head
in one room...

616
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,351
and his torso in another.

617
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,521
What are you saying?

618
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,692
I don't want him
to do that to you.

619
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,028
Who?

620
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,159
Homelander?

621
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,163
You think Homelander did that?

622
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,789
The things...

623
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,833
that I've watched him do...

624
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,173
...the things
that he made me do...

625
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,014
If he ever finds out
about you...

626
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,516
(takes deep breath)

627
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,062
Why are you telling me this now?

628
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,863
I don't want you
to hate me anymore.

629
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,533
Cool.

630
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,702
-Thank you.
-(chuckles)

631
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,287
You're welcome.

632
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:38,248
It's crazy you don't have one
already, actually.

633
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,876
I don't really have anyone
to call, though.

634
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,211
(sighs)

635
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,587
You could call me.

636
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,133
You know, Ryan, um,

637
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,970
when I was your age, I didn't
have many friends either.

638
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:55,557
Mom says being lonely
makes you know yourself better.

639
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,892
Well...

640
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,395
that's not wrong, I suppose.

641
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,982
Can I tell you a secret?

642
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,527
Man-to-man, you know?

643
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,740

644
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,452
(chuckles)

645
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,331
My dad and I...

646
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:23,252
we never played catch in the
yard with a World Series ball.

647
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,463
Truth is...

648
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,924
I never had a dad.

649
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,760
Or a mom.

650
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,472
Wait, you... you didn't?

651
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,187
See, sometimes it's hard, Ryan,

652
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,523
being...
(sighs)

653
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:47,109
superior to every single
other person on the planet.

654
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,319
It's-it's... isolating.

655
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,488
And gods...

656
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,909
should not have to feel
that kind of...

657
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,828
yeah, pain.

658
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,372
Because that...

659
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,751
is what we are, Ryan.

660
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,213
You and me.

661
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,135
We're gods.

662
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:21,393
Son, we can do anything we want.

663
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:24,229
And no one can stop us.

664
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:27,399
Now, that..

665
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,027
that's a good feeling.

666
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,279
A really good feeling.

667
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,825
And now you...

668
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,161
and me...

669
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,997
can share it together.

670
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,960
I...

671
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,588
I-I should probably go
to bed now, you know?

672
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,590
Sure.

673
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,342
(pats Ryan)

674
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,437
I love you, son.

675
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,983
You know, you can say it back.

676
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,069
Um, I...

677
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,695
love you, too.

678
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,489
(sighs)

679
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,407
This is nice.

680
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,420
-Your turn, Mom.
-You need to leave.

681
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,465
Excuse me?

682
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:36,134
You need to get the fuck
out of my house.

683
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,560
What happens one day

684
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:49,231
when Ryan asks to go
to a baseball game,

685
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:52,568
swim in the ocean,
or eat at a Burger King?

686
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,655
How do you think he's gonna feel
when he finds out

687
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:59,658
that you've lied to him
his whole life?

688
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,329
You think he's gonna be happy

689
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:08,125
that you kept him
in this pretty prison?

690
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,421
Or...

691
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,382
do you think
he'll fucking despise you?

692
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,093
Hmm?

693
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,138
Let's go ask him.

694
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,724
Don't.

695
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,272
You were right.

696
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:33,942
I'm not gonna get bored
and move on.

697
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:36,194
I'm not going anywhere.

698
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,531
So feel free to tell Dr. Park
to go fuck himself.

699
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,956

Halothane shot.

702
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,759
I only got two of these.

703

Hmm, Homelander?

750
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,276
No. Pippi Longstocking.

751
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,571
Pippi Longstocking.
She's a nine-year-old girl.

752
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,198
Lived in a house all by herself.

753
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,408
Pet monkey. Could lift
a horse with one hand.

754
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,410
You-you haven't read
Pippi Longstocking?

755

I guess not.

756
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,622
Hmm.

757
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:24,417
Okay, well, uh, I used to dress
as her every Halloween,

758
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,586
and all the girls dressed
like Disney sluts

759
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,505
would make fun of me,
and you know what I thought?

760
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,049
I thought, "Who fucking cares?"

761
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,133
Pippi didn't care.

762
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,386
She never cared
about being polite.

763
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,346
Or cute.

764
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,098
Look.

765
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:42,769
Fuck this world
for confusing nice with good.

766
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,646
Be a bitch if you want.
Be whatever.

767
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,649
Just drop the mask
once in a while.

768
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,942
Feels good.

769
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,111
You can finally breathe.

770
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,742
Oh, and if someone sticks
a dick in your mouth,

771
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,911
bite it off.

772
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,790
Pippi Longstocking
would bite a "D."

773
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,875

779
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,997

780
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,750

off.

00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,472
Are you telling me

794
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,225
that her family
is worth more to you

795
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,476
than you seeing your own?

796
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:49,896
No, I'm not.

797
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:54,526
But Kimiko is one of us.

798
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,529
I'll find another way.

799
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,739
I suppose you agree, don't you?

800
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,033
Since your tongue
is halfway up her ass.

801
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,035
Jesus. It's like

802
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,830
Hughie's infected you both
with a raging case of vagina.

803
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,304
Becca's alive.

804
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,306
What?

805
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,895
She's alive. Vought's
holding her captive somewhere.

806
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,897
-Butcher, if you...
-No.

807
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,274
I'm not stark raving, all right?

808
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,234
I fucking saw her.

809
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,365
She had a little boy
with her. Uh...

810
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,034
The spitting image
of Homelander.

811
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,246
I thought he just wanted
to humiliate me,

812
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,248
show me what he'd done
to my girl

813
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,167
before he gave me the good news.

814
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,710
Then I woke up

815
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,712
three hours later
in a Tony fucking Cicero's.

816
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,755
God knows why.

817
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,722
I got to find her,

818
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,184
and I got to get her
the fuck out of there.

819
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,605
And I need your help to do it.

820
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,232
Are you fucking with us?

821
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,234
I find the terrorist
for Mallory,

822
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,236
she finds Becca for me.

823
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,613
That's the deal I made.

824
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,531
I know what I done t-to you.

825
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:24,991
All right?

826
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:28,411
And by rights,
you should tell me to fuck off.

827
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,996
But still...

828
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,624
I'm asking.

829
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:50,350
When you...

830
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,435
When you disappeared
that night...

831
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:55,146
I'm sorry.

832
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:56,523
We were supposed to watch out
for each other

833
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,399
and then you were gone.

834
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:08,076
Shining Light sent me here.

835
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:12,622
Put the needle in my spine

836
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,708
and filled me full
of the blue poison.

837
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,964
I should have found you.

838
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:25,343
No. I'm the big sister. I should
have come back for you, but...

839
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,517
...they made me into...

840
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:37,730
...a monster.

841
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,275
(chuckles, sniffles)

842
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:44,112
If that's true,
we're both monsters now.

843
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,825
Did it hurt?

844
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,077
I wanted to die.

845
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,541
Me too.

846
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,877
They had one dose left

847
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,255
and they knew it worked on you

848
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:05,800
so they figured
it would work on me.

849
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,685
I'm sorry.

850

in here? Get out.

863
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:34,263
This is not how it looks.

864
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,849
Okay? It's just
a misunderstanding.

865

Homelander
should have charred your ass

866
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,271
as soon as he found out
that you were fucking Hughie.

867
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,690
Hughie saved your life.

868
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,108
We both did.

869
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,485
Your mistake.

870
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:50,363
Okay, if you just give me
a minute, I can explain.

871
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:53,533
You know, I just want you
to think about me

872
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,368
when you're getting the skin

873
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,705
peeled off your face, bitch.

874
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,754
You're not gonna
tell anyone anything.

875
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,175

876

877
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:15,555
You're not gonna do shit.

878
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,849

879
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,561
'Cause you killed
your fucking girlfriend.

880
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:27,275
That's what you told Hughie,
right? That you killed Popclaw?

881
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,072
You can't prove anything.

882
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,116
Did she suffer?

883
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:40,496
Did you look
into her big, sad eyes

884
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,123
while you did it?

885
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,543
Fuck you.

886
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:49,464
Yeah, see, I looked
at the Vought forensics report,

887
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,841
and...
(exhales)

888
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,259
Wow.

889
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,386
All those needles
jammed into her arm

890
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:57,221
at the same time?

891
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,224
I mean, one of them
actually shattered the bone.

892
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,810
Did you know that? Would someone
really do that to themselves?

893
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:05,646
I mean, doesn't look
like an accident to me.

894
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,191
I mean,
Vought's happy to bury it,

895
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:11,778
but, you know, say, if...

896
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,530
Sports Illustrated found out...

897
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,118
If you do that,

898
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,121
I'm gonna take you down
right with me.

899
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,540
And then we'll both be dead.

900
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,542

901

They'll keep you safe too.

908
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,804
Or we can go home.
Back to the village.

909
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:23,850
There is no village anymore.

910
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,227
What?

911
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,229

This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

915
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:38,781
Destroyed the camp. And all
the villages around it, too.

916
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:42,159
There were bodies everywhere.

an old woman in half?

922
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,885
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,261

in their cribs
