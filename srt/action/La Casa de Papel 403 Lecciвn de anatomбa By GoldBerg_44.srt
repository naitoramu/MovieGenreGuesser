because he's abnormally egocentric.

299
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,240
He'll respect the hierarchy.

300
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,790
He would respect it if the heist
was two hours, or three, or one night.

301
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,910
We're talking about multiple days,

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,750
and he'll be under
higher pressure than usual.

303
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,370
- I can keep Martín under control...
- You can't!

304
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,410
- Because I've been doing it for years.
- You can't control him. He's an egomaniac.

305
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,330
He's obsessed with being in charge.

306
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,830
And that can only mean one thing.

307
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,910
If it's not him in charge, he'll do
anything he has to do to take control.

308
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,750
And he won't care if he has to execute,
betray or create chaos.

309
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,790
He's obsessive, egocentric,
trusts his instincts and is a true genius.

310
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,750
Like you.

311
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,370
If you prefer mediocre people,

312
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,790
you'll find plenty here.
They'll follow you like sheep.

<font color="#138ce9">PROFESSOR:</font> Don't you understand
that being a genius complicates things?

314
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,950

because we won't know what he'll do.

315
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,500
Listen to me. You're my brother.

316
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,500
I would put you in charge of any heist
without a shadow of a doubt.

317
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,290
But him...

318
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,500
You're wrong about trusting me
and not him. I'm much less reliable.

They have an oven.

335
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,790
They likely used it
to get rid of evidence.

336
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,750
I'll take it for analysis.

I'm gonna separate the melted parts.

340
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,750
I think I found something.

341
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,620
What's wrong?

342
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,910
Nothing.

343
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,040
So a Maserati, huh?

344
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,450
You've gotta be fucking kidding.
Is it out in the newspaper already?

345
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,660
It's totally fine.

346
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,300
- I can give you a ride, if you want.
- What the fuck are you saying, Tokyo?

347
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,160
No big deal.
Just a little ride. That's all.

348
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,250
That's all?

349
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,790
Then we push a button, erase the tape,

350
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,950
destroy the evidence,
and there's no record of anything.

351
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,290
Mónica dumped me.

352
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,080
I'm a free man.

353
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,160
So I don't need to erase
any fucking black box.

354
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
I'll take the Maserati,
stick my foot on the pedal,

355
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,450
and I'll start doing 360s
till the tires burn off...

356
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,100
without a care in the world, beautiful.

357
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,040
Oh...

358
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,870
- a reckless driver?
- So reckless.

359
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,450
So reckless you better be careful,

360
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,910
or you'll have to take the car to the
mechanics and change the suspension.

361
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,700
And wait until you see what I do
to the chassis.

362
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540

I bet it was put there on purpose.

365
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,350
By the way it was hidden
and melted at the back of the oven,

366
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,200
it's impossible
it was put there on purpose.

367
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,290
So then?

368
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,700
The plastic from the chip
has a recorded number of up to 19 digits,

369
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,120
unique to each SIM card.

370
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,500
- Hm-mmm.
- This disappeared during the combustion,

371
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,410
but it seems that during the process,
it bent and touched the metallic chip,

372
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,580
and it imprinted seven numbers on it.

373
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,040
We crosschecked it
with data from several phone carriers,

374
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,660
and we came up with 354 cards
matching those end numbers.

375
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,580
One of them was bought three months ago
and has only made one call,

376
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,450
and it was made during the heist.

Bingo!

379
