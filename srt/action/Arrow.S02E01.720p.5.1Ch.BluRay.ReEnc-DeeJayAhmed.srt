1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,571
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,401
If I only knew
how you were spending your nights.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,530
Why should I trust you?

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,447
Oliver.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,610
- It's past time we talked.
- About what? You being a serial killer?

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,968
Start with Laurel. You're
still in love with her.

7
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:19,714
So are you.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,884
Lord knows I am guilty of a lot of things
between us...

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,805
but not you and her.
She chose you.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,761
My name is Moira Dearden Queen.
I'm the CEO of Queen Consolidated.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,721
I have been complicit in an undertaking
with one horrible purpose.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,002
To destroy the Glades and everyone in it.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,683
But you need to know that the architect
of this nightmare is Malcolm Merlyn.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,451
You can't beat me, Oliver.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,082
Because you don't know, in your heart,
what you're fighting for.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,521
- Is Laurel safe?
- Yeah, you saved her.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,286
Tommy? It should have been me.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,726
Felicity, if you're so scared, why
did you insist on sitting up front?

19
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,191
It was the only
seat with a seatbelt.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,921
Which will come in handy
when we hit the water at 180 miles an hour.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,846
Which will not happen.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,323
I think that means we're here.

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,410
Lian Yu.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,084
You said the parachutes
were just in case.

25
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,786
Yeah, just in case
we made it here.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,286
- Come on.
- No.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,531
All right, Felicity, on three.

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,842
- I don't think I can do this. I can't...
- One.

29
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,841
Thanks for waiting until we touched down.

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,929
My pleasure.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,329
Let's move.

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,160
- Shh.
- What is it?

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,049
Thought I heard something.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,291
Dig?

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,931
Don't move.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,360
It's a land mine.
I'm gonna try to disarm it.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,324
You can't.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,569
Diggle, back away.

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,488
Felicity, don't move.

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,282
- God, you're really sweaty.
- You're a hard man to find.

41
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,886
You shouldn't have come here.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,291
Would have e-mailed,
but this isn't exactly a Wi-Fi hotspot.

43
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,448
This was where you lived
when you were here?

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,688
I mean, the first time you were here.

45
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,283
For some of it.

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,847
Could you at least pretend
like you're glad to see us?

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,482
Dig and I spent weeks tracking you down,
we've traveled halfway across the world.

48
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,212
And this morning we flew
in a plane so old I'm

49
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:01,833
pretty sure I was safer
once I jumped out of it.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,480
You could at least offer us a water.

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,764
Or coconut.

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,244
Fresh out of coconuts.

53
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,811
I am happy to see you.

54
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,208
But I know why you're here.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,124
I'm not coming back to Starling City.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,162
I can't. My mission, my father's list,
it was a fool's crusade...

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,488
and I failed.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,409
Malcolm Merlyn destroyed the Glades.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,325
Tommy died.

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,087
And the Hood couldn't stop it.

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,884
So don't ask me to put it on again.

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,163
Ever.

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,650
This isn't about you being the vigilante.
This is about you being Oliver Queen.

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,689
Your mother's in prison, Oliver.
Her trial's coming up.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,729
Thea's out on her own.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,126
Your family needs you.

67
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,930
So does the family business.

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,920
All the bad press after the Undertaking
left Queen Consolidated ripe...

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,229
for a hostile takeover by a
Stellmoor International.

70
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:09,313
They've gutted every company
they've taken over.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,166
Once they gobble up Queen Consolidated,
30,000 employees are gonna be out of a job.

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,331
Including one very blond IT expert.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,641
Listen, I get why you had to leave, Oliver.
Probably better than anybody else.

74
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,450
I've been there.

75
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,644
And after what happened,
nobody can blame you for leaving.

76
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,769
But it's time to come home.

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,889
You're not the first man to learn the
hard way women are a distraction.

78
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,683
You've come very far in a few months.

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,129
- Don't beat yourself up.
- Well, uh, apparently that's his job.

80
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,722
And I love my job. Not that I wouldn't
trade it for a way off this island.

81
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,049
While you two were playing with each other,
I was hunting.

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,005
There's nothing more attractive
than a woman who can hunt.

83
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,851
When I was marooned here,
my first meal was a pheasant.

84
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,247
Your father cooked it for me.

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,811
He was an awful cook.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,525
- Yeah.
- But a great father.

87
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,848
I'm looking at the proof.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,091
Let's eat.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,604
What's that?

90
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,802
That's Fyers' proximity detector.

91
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,646
We salvaged it from the wreckage
of the soldiers' camp.

92
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,605
Picks up anything moving
outside our safe zone.

93
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,606
It's been five months since we stopped
Fyers. He and all of his men were dead.

94
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,164
- So maybe it's an animal.
- Here's an imaging interface.

95
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,649
Those are not animals.

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,444
We're not alone on this island.

97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,926
Who's Blood?

98
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,081
An alderman from the Glades trying
to save the city.

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,769
Fill your shoes.

100
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,566
Here's everything
on Stellmoor International.

101
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,291
Vice President of Acquisitions
is a woman named Isabel Rochev.

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,929
She looks angry in every photo.

103
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,963
So where to? Office?

104
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,570
Home. I wanna check in on Thea.

105
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,242
- Uh, she's not at your house, Oliver.
- Where is she?

106
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,489
- I only have a second.
- That's all right.

107
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,760
- My boss has been all over my ass anyway.
- Ha, ha. She sounds like a real...

108
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,205
Ow.

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,041
You have got to be kidding me.

110
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,164
Come on, I don't wanna fight.

111
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,407
Clearly you do.

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,040
Since you keep on taking on every street thug
or drug dealer you can get your fists on.

113
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,407
It's not like that.
The Glades are worse than ever.

114
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,645
I know, but you already saved a busload of
people and managed not to get buried alive.

115
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,650
I mean, how much more of a hero
would you need to be?

116
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,081
It's like you have a death wish.

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,926
And guess what. It's going to come true.

118
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,202
Yeah, well, someone has to do something.

119
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,562
And stand up for what's right, like he did.

120
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,291
The vigilante?

121
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,371
Who hasn't been seen since the earthquake,
which means he did get buried alive...

122
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,086
- and isn't coming back.
- I'm back.

123
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,124
Ollie.

124
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,922
You remember my friend Roy.

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,407
- Still here?
- Always.

126
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,962
So how was Europe?
You never texted, no postcards.

127
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
Almost like you were on
the island all over again.

128
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,801
Yeah, sorry. I was kind of distracted.
Snow skiing, water skiing.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,047
A lot of skiing.

130
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,811
I hear rumors that my club
is under new management.

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,810
Uh, it's my club now,
and you're not getting it back.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,971
- You're not old enough to drink.
- But I am old enough to run a bar.

133
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,804
Have you made it to Iron Heights?

134
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,163
To visit the woman who dropped a city
on 500 innocent people?

135
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,520
- No, thank you.
- Thea.

136
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,685
That's not what Mom did.

137
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,961
Right.

138
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,049
She had no choice.

139
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,841
But guess what. She did.

140
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,691
A choice not to be a mass murderer.

141
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,162
And I have a choice too.
So I choose not to be her daughter.

142
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,601
But I am so happy you are home.

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,832
Look, I need to deal with
our liquor distributor

144
00:09:48,857 --> 00:09:50,906
who shorted me on
yesterday's delivery.

145
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,651
And one of my bartenders called in sick.

146
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,808
So... What?

147
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,842
Nothing. It's nice to see you like this.

148
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,727
Like what?

149
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,164
Together.

150
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,443
Central City says construction

151
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,483
on the S.T.A.R. Labs
Particle Accelerator...

152
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,682
should be completed by Christmas.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,801
And in local news, billionaire Oliver Queen
has returned once again to Starling City.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,925
With his mother's upcoming trial
and his father's company in free fall...

155
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,170
analysts are asking what the Queen
family scion has planned next.

156
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,360
Wasn't our country founded
on a brand of vigilantism, Mr. Donner?

157
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,650
The revolutionaries at the Boston Tea Party
were certainly choosing justice over law.

158
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,890
I'd hardly compare our founding fathers
to the Hood, Mr. Mayor.

159
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,651
Or these twisted copycats who have risen
in his wake.

160
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,604
Miss Lance.

161
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,370
What do you think about vigilantes?

162
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,829
I'd be foolish to
disagree with my new boss.

163
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,669
I knew I was smart to hire you.

164
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,571
I'd heard you'd joined
the District Attorney's Office.

165
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,966
It was time for a change.

166
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,253
Still, I'm sorry that
you and your colleagues

167
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,234
at CNRI won't be opening
your doors again.

168
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,440
- There were no doors left to be reopened.
- Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor.

169
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,641
They're playing my song.

170
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,565
Good evening.

171
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,889
It has been a very difficult year
for Starling City.

172
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,447
Our losses have been incalculable.

173
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,847
Our grief unimaginable.

174
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,442
But with the generous donations
you people are making tonight...

175
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,244
we will come back from this tragedy...

176
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,365
You have failed this city, Mr. Mayor.

177
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,370
The Glades descended into hell
on your watch.

178
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,884
You swore to protect all the citizens
of Starling, not just the wealthy.

179
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm very sorry about this, folks. Uh, we'll
have this sorted out in just a minute.

180
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,084
Mr. District Attorney.

181
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,724
We are the Hoods.

182
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,562
And what was taken from us,
we will take back.

183
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,368
All units be advised...

184
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,206
Laurel.

185
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,646
Dad, I'm fine.

186
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,081
You've got one very brave daughter there,
sir.

187
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,567
Yeah, one daughter.
I can't stand to lose another.

188
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,410
I still can't believe this happened.

189
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,444
The Hoods' attacks have strictly been
limited to the financial sector...

190
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,325
trying to redistribute wealth
in the Glades at gunpoint.

191
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,126
Yeah, well clearly that's not getting
the result they're looking for, is it?

192
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,921
Did you get a good look at any of them?

193
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,089
Hard to focus on anything other
than the gun barrel pointed at my face.

194
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,648
- Well, tattoos, distinguishing marks.
- What do you think you're doing?

195
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,608
Interviewing the witness is the job
of the detective, Officer Lance.

196
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,406
This is my daughter.
She was nearly killed tonight.

197
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,605
Well, as a parent,
you're welcome to stay.

198
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,868
But as a beat cop, you're
more than free to go.

199
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,399
You know, one of the downsides
of being demoted, I don't

200
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:11,544
get to witness his sunny
disposition on a daily basis.

201
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,251
- Dad, give me a sec.
- Yeah.

202
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,764
I didn't know you were back in town.

203
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,884
I just got back a little while ago.
And I was gonna call...

204
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,730
but then I saw you on TV...

205
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,561
so I thought that I would come
and make sure you were safe.

206
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,603
Just four hooded gunmen.

207
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,883
Nothing a few self-defense classes
couldn't handle.

208
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,044
- Take a walk?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,364
Sorry I left.

210
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,480
Believe me, I get it.

211
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,049
After the funeral, I think we both
needed time to figure things out.

212
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,321
On our own.

213
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,727
I didn't get very far on my own.

214
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,570
And you?

215
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,569
Figure anything out?

216
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,084
That I made a mistake.

217
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,930
When I slept with you.

218
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,088
I know it wasn't exactly cheating...

219
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,368
because Tommy had broken up
with me.

220
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,726
But he only did that because he thought
that you and I should be together.

221
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,561
All I know is that I feel
like I betrayed him.

222
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,688
And now he's gone.

223
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,610
And there's nothing I can do
to make it right.

224
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,291
I know how that feels.

225
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,411
When I brought your sister
on the Queen's Gambit.

226
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,560
I betrayed you.

227
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,244
Your father.

228
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,442
There's no forgiveness
for what I led Sara into.

229
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,203
I would give anything to...

230
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,247
To go back.

231
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,170
Yeah.

232
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,567
But we can't go back.

233
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,687
Diggle. I don't like being played.

234
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,166
I'm not sure what you mean.

235
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,511
It's why you came to the
island and brought me

236
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,548
back to Starling City,
these Hood copycats.

237
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,801
And what if it was?

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,651
They're just doing what
you did last year,

239
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,716
terrorizing 1 percenters
into cleaning up their act.

240
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,042
Except they don't have
your restraint, Oliver.

241
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,083
- Or your honor.
- I'm done being the vigilante.

242
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,722
- Maybe this town still needs a vigilante.
- Now it has four of them.

243
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,160
How's that working?

244
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,200
Please take me home.

245
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,405
I've got a big day at the office tomorrow
trying to save my family's company.

246
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,443
Absolutely.

247
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,802
Mr. Queen.

248
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,727
And in local news, billionaire Oliver Queen
has returned once again to Starling City...

249
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,843
Unbelievable.

250
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,001
We off the mayor on live TV,
and what's the local news keep showing?

251
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,124
Oliver Queen.

252
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,182
Why?

253
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,672
Because he's taking
over the family business.

254
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,684
- We've been going about this wrong.
- What do you mean?

255
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,245
If we want real payback...

256
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,161
we gotta take the fight to the name
that did this to us.

257
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,169
- Queen?
- Yeah.

258
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,647
He's just some useless brat.

259
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,568
The Applied Sciences Division
of Queen Consolidated...

260
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,643
built the earthquake generator.

261
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,970
If we want real justice...

262
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,682
then that family has to pay
for the suffering it's caused us.

263
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,604
In full.

264
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,010
Hello? Earth to Queen?

265
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,362
Did you drop a Vertigo
when I wasn't looking?

266
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,164
Just distracted.

267
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,966
About what your brother said?
About your mom?

268
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,406
Eavesdrop much?

269
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,960
What I lack in height,
I make up for in wicked good hearing.

270
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,245
Heh. Well,
don't keep me in suspense, Harper.

271
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,046
What's your take on the matter?
Though, keep in mind...

272
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,607
I do control your paycheck
and your sex life.

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,563
Well, both my parents weren't worth a damn.
Either of them.

274
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,086
You never talk about them.

275
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,248
You got nothing nice to say, right?

276
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,403
Still, I'd be glad to see them.

277
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,087
And talk to them, if I could, but...

278
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,802
Look, you already lost your dad.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,890
Your mom, she's still here
and I'm sure she'd love to see you.

280
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,327
Sure she's dying to.

281
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,362
Just like a lot of mothers in the Glades...

282
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,723
who won't ever get to see
their kids again...

283
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,522
because my mother helped kill them.

284
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,003
I'm not going to that prison.

285
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,646
It's the only way I know how to hurt her.

286
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,645
You might want to consider
how much it's hurting you.

287
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,485
Queen Consolidated,
how may I help you?

288
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,083
They're in the conference room.
Just FYI, no one is eating the bagels.

289
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,411
- Isabel Rochev.
- Oliver Queen. Sorry I'm late.

290
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,967
For this meeting or a career in business?

291
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,090
I didn't realize hostile takeovers
were filled with so much hostility.

292
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,021
Not at all, I'm actually
in quite a good mood.

293
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:26,625
Really?

294
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,770
- So destroying companies agrees with you?
- Winning agrees with me.

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,684
You haven't won yet.

296
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,200
Since you majored in Dropping
out of College, let me

297
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,332
put this in terms that are
easy for you to understand.

298
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,165
You control 45 percent
of Queen Consolidated stock.

299
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,761
I control 45 percent,
leaving 10 percent outstanding.

300
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,884
But in two days, the board will
release the final 10 percent.

301
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,082
And I'll buy it before you do.

302
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,248
With what money?

303
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,040
I doubt your trust
fund is that large.

304
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,065
And no angel investor will
go near the company...

305
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,641
that built the machine
that destroyed half the city.

306
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,571
Companies rise and fall, Mr. Queen.

307
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,603
Your company has fallen.

308
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,565
Oliver Queen!

309
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,243
You've failed this city.

310
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,521
Get down!

311
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,731
Fall back!

312
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,251
Oliver, go! Go, go, go!

313
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,084
Get Queen!

314
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,688
Queen's getting away. Go, move!

315
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,244
- Miss Rochev. I'm sorry about this.
- Because they were after you?

316
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,245
Because what happens in this building
is my responsibility.

317
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,006
Only for the next 48 hours.

318
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,448
Still can't get used to you
in that uniform, Detective Lance.

319
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,769
It's "officer" now. I'm
just glad it still fit.

320
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,564
They hurt you?

321
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,762
Thanks. I'm okay.

322
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,602
You, uh, heard anything
from our mutual friend lately?

323
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,169
Nope.

324
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,330
In fact, I keep waiting for him to show up.

325
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,089
- You could've stopped those guys.
- Yeah, not without giving Isabel Rochev...

326
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,567
and the Hoods a pretty good
idea what I'm capable of.

327
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,521
I think what Felicity's wondering is
whether you avoided taking those Hoods on.

328
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,183
And Oliver, she's not
the only one wondering.

329
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,987
I told you. I did not come
back to Starling City...

330
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,050
- to be the vigilante.
- But they came after you, Oliver.

331
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,369
- You could've taken them out.
- No, I couldn't, Diggle.

332
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,451
Look, there's a part of being the Hood
that neither one of you are considering.

333
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,405
The body count.

334
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,803
And excuse me for saying this,
but so what?

335
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,201
Since when do you care?

336
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,088
Since Tommy.

337
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,170
After he found out my secret,
you know what Tommy called me?

338
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,645
A murderer.

339
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,564
He was right.

340
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,885
My best friend died thinking
that I was a murderer...

341
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,881
and anyone that I kill
dishonors his memory.

342
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,166
So don't.

343
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,361
It's not like you've killed
every guy you've faced.

344
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,244
I could've.

345
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,927
Because when I put on the hood,
it's kill or be killed.

346
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,130
That is what kept me alive.

347
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,763
So I should've stayed on the island.

348
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,720
Is that where you're going now?

349
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,241
The two of you won't help me
save my family's company.

350
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,091
I'm gonna talk to somebody who will.

351
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,322
Someone's definitely out there.

352
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,562
They're moving closer.

353
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,407
- Where do you think you're going?
- Flanking position.

354
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,728
If they get the drop on you,
you'll want some backup.

355
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,288
She's teaching you Chinese. How sweet.

356
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,448
I'm sure she'd be happy
to teach you too.

357
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,206
Shado!

358
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

359
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,649
- I'm sorry I didn't make it here sooner.
- No. No, no.

360
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,604
Please, Oliver.

361
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,282
There are gonna be enough apologies
with me apologizing to you...

362
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,450
- for the rest of my life.
- You don't have to.

363
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,043
You saved hundreds of lives.

364
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,083
And killed hundreds more.

365
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,762
- Including Tommy.
- That was Malcolm.

366
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,084
Your sister doesn't see it that way.

367
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,684
And my attorney is thrilled.

368
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,360
If my own daughter can't forgive me...

369
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,248
she's not too optimistic
about 12 strangers in a jury box.

370
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,724
All right, enough of that. How has
it been going at Queen Consolidated?

371
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,083
- Yes, we do get the news in here, Oliver.
- Right.

372
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,049
You know, if I'd known the key...

373
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,443
to you taking your rightful place
at the company was its demise...

374
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,087
I would've declared bankruptcy
a year ago.

375
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,284
I don't know if I'll get
to run it for long.

376
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,244
Stellmoor.

377
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,647
Their VP is coming after us hard.

378
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,167
- Isabel Rochev.
- Yes.

379
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,649
Do not trust that woman, Oliver.
She is dangerous.

380
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,650
Mom, everywhere I look,
there are no good options.

381
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,730
I don't know what to do.

382
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,484
You don't have to do it yourself.

383
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,523
This is a family business.

384
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,202
Heh. I love Thea. I don't think
that she wants anything to do with it.

385
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,926
I wasn't talking about Thea.

386
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Table 7 needs bottle service and I need
a round of martinis on the three-top.

387
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,565
You go see your mom yet?

388
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,485
- Ugh, I thought about what you said.
- And?

389
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,328
And I'll go see her when you stop going out
at night looking to clean up the streets.

390
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,719
What does one thing have
to do with the other?

391
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:07,545
I guess they're both things
that are never gonna happen.

392
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,089
We're looking for Oliver Queen.

393
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,809
He's back in town. He owns this dump.

394
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,248
Where can we find him?

395
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,891
Okay, then, plan B.

396
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,050
I'm gonna start shooting people
until Mr. Queen...

397
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,050
grows a pair.

398
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,366
Roy!

399
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,289
Back off, hero.

400
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm just as happy to kill this Queen
as her brother. Let's go!

401
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,850
Roy, help! Help!

402
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,731
- One of the guys was missing a hand.
- What's going on here?

403
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,003
Most of it, anyway. He still had sutures.
- It was the Hoods again.

404
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,851
They came here looking for you.
They took Thea instead.

405
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,702
Where?

406
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:30,431
I'm sorry. I really tried
to stop them, but...

407
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,924
Queen. Oliver.

408
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,564
We'll get your sister back.

409
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,722
I'm just gonna check something
downstairs.

410
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,206
- Anything else?
- That's all I got.

411
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,880
I've made a few improvements
down here...

412
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,522
just in case, you know,
you decided to come back.

413
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,766
- We need to find these guys.
- I've been trying ever since you got back.

414
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,440
Figured you'd come around eventually.

415
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,925
I kept that. Heh, I liked
watching you do that.

416
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,130
Thea's boyfriend said one of them
was missing part of his hand.

417
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,685
Maybe a veteran?

418
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,227
Check hospital records,
any males that have had

419
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:33,353
surgical amputations
on their extremities.

420
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,410
Cross-checking by race and age.

421
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,251
Got one.
Jeff Deveau, African American, late 30s.

422
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,602
What else can you get on him?

423
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,810
- Ex-Marine.
- Would explain how he could handle himself.

424
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,447
- Did he lose his hand overseas?
- No. In the earthquake.

425
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,251
Says here he and his wife were trying
to make it across the 52nd Street Bridge...

426
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,484
when it collapsed. She didn't make it.

427
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,605
Phone records, please.
I wanna know who he's in contact with.

428
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,166
He's made a lot of calls
to a church in the Glades.

429
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,203
Something called "Standing Strong."

430
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,210
A support group
for those who lost loved ones in the quake.

431
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,325
Great place to meet three other guys as
angry as you looking for a little payback.

432
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,648
Get me an address, please.

433
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,602
You're gonna need this.

434
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,682
I had it custom-made.

435
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,562
How'd I do?

436
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,610
It's perfect.

437
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,325
You were right. Once I signed on, I stopped
thinking about all the bodies you dropped.

438
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,601
Because I knew that being the Hood
meant occasionally being a killer.

439
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,046
Maybe there's another way.

440
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,647
They have my sister.

441
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
What other way is there?

442
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,203
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna save her.

443
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,809
Listen, kid. You are not
the only one who cares for her.

444
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,486
But there are a lot of them.
Wait for my signal.

445
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,967
Where are the graves?

446
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,441
Where are the graves?

447
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,609
I don't know what you're talking about.

448
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,804
Tell me.

449
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,765
Damn it.

450
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,727
Oliver, no!

451
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,691
Oliver!

452
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,888
So, what do you wanna do with her?

453
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,327
We could knock her out,
drop her off somewhere.

454
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,569
Why don't you just buy her
a new pair of Pradas while you're at it?

455
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,046
She's seen our faces.

456
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,686
Look, offing Oliver Queen's one thing,
but his sister?

457
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,481
She's not much older than my sister was
when she was killed in the earthquake.

458
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,927
Your sister wasn't killed.
She was murdered.

459
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,088
By her mother.

460
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,251
What we're doing here is justice,
which makes us the heroes.

461
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,329
She didn't kill anybody.

462
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,891
My mother didn't kill anyone.

463
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,048
Malcolm Merlyn destroyed the Glades.

464
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,641
With Mommy's help.

465
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,810
Merlyn killed my father.

466
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,970
She thought he killed my brother too.

467
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,928
She was afraid of him.

468
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,405
She must have been so afraid.

469
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,126
Just like my wife...

470
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,527
when our house collapsed on top of her.

471
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,325
Get away from her!

472
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,404
- Help!
- Let's go.

473
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,090
- Please!
- Move!

474
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,090
- Go, move!
- Please!

475
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,730
Stop!

476
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,206
Let her go.

477
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,447
You want to save her?

478
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,044
There was no justice for people like the
Queens till you showed us how to get it.

479
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,641
You showed us.

480
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,931
Go!

481
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,723
You shoot me, we both die.

482
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,251
You'll drop me anyway.

483
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,248
I know you. You're a killer.

484
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,246
Keep it under 40 next time.
Have a good evening.

485
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,587
Do you know who they are?

486
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:42,747
I think the Hoods gives
me a pretty good idea.

487
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,002
Bring them in.

488
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,781
Where you been? Typically
when I bring in guys that

489
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:49,709
you've gone after, they
were a little more dead.

490
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,644
I'm trying another way.

491
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,968
I didn't mean to disturb you.

492
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,130
I didn't know you were here.
I was just...

493
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,089
I come here a lot.

494
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,366
- I can go.
- No, it's...

495
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,370
You don't have to. It's, uh...

496
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,289
Laurel, I understand.

497
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,850
After everything that's happened...

498
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,168
I understand why we can't be together.

499
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,529
But I still need you in my life.

500
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,884
We've been through too much
for it to be any other way.

501
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,770
I feel like I betrayed him too.

502
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,846
Before the Hood, we didn't have things like
earthquake machines or copycat vigilantes.

503
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,610
Laurel.

504
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,291
Malcolm killed Tommy.

505
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,086
He was killed in the crossfire
between two archers.

506
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,086
And now that Malcolm's dead,
there's only one archer left.

507
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,449
And I'm gonna help my boss catch him.

508
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,251
That outfit with your coloring.

509
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,330
Isn't that cruel and unusual punishment
or something?

510
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,046
I've done my best to avoid mirrors in here.

511
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,891
- So...
- How've you been?

512
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,526
Don't worry about me.
I want to hear about you.

513
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,689
How are you doing?

514
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,488
Are you still seeing, uh...?

515
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,967
Roy was his name, wasn't it?

516
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,446
Sweetheart, I'm fine, really.

517
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,083
It's not that.

518
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,090
I...

519
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,687
- I almost died last night.
- What?

520
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,566
- Thea, what happened?
- It doesn't matter.

521
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,169
When I thought it was over...

522
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,761
I kept thinking that if...

523
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,248
If I died...

524
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,964
you would spend the rest of your life
thinking that I hated you.

525
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
I don't want to hate you.

526
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,500
I really tried to.

527
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,165
But I can't.

528
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,840
I can't, Mom.

529
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,969
However long I am in this place,
you have freed me.

530
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,723
If I hug you, are they gonna shoot us?

531
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,165
I'm willing to risk it if you are.

532
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,691
You can't win this.
I now own 50 percent of the stock.

533
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,249
By tomorrow I'll have the outstanding 5
percent and I will control your company.

534
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,001
Any attempt to fight me will lead to
litigation and leave you penniless.

535
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,091
And trust me, poverty isn't as glamorous
as Charles Dickens made it look.

536
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,926
What if I found someone to invest
new equity capital?

537
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,406
A white knight?

538
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,042
With all due respect, your last name
is now associated with mass murder.

539
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,130
- Even you don't have that good a friend.
- You're right.

540
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,449
I have family.

541
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,650
Mr. Steele, it was my understanding
that you had resigned as CEO.

542
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,887
I did.

543
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,522
I'm now chief financial officer
of Starling National Bank.

544
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,725
And my institution has committed
rescue financing for Mr. Queen.

545
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,050
We bought the remaining
shares of Queen Consolidated

546
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:21,544
when they were
released this morning.

547
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,227
Now I know I majored
in dropping out,

548
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:25,464
but I'm sure that makes us
partners going forward...

549
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,889
so I guess we will be seeing
a lot of each other.

550
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,240
You aren't at all what
people say about you.

551
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,926
Most people fail to see the real me.

552
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,646
Thank you, Walter.

553
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,488
Thank you for reaching out to me.

554
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,001
Whatever's happened between
your mother and me...

555
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,090
I'm gratified that you know
you can still count on me.

556
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,484
Your father would have been
very proud of you, Oliver.

557
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,211
- Ms. Smoak.
- Mr. Steele.

558
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,407
You did it.

559
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,566
Not bad for someone who got a D
in 10th-grade algebra.

560
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,760
If it's online, I can find it.

561
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,369
Uh...

562
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,567
Well, it was just like a good friend
once told me.

563
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,521
I had to find another way.

564
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,686
We're not alone.

565
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,963
Question is, where did they come from?

566
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,567
Hey, what's up?

567
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,650
- Just came back from visiting my mom.
- Really?

568
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,605
- Good for you.
- So, what do you say?

569
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,280
You ready to start spending your nights
safe with me?

570
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,606
Absolutely.

571
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,725
- Stop it!
- Come on, baby.

572
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,885
I'm gonna pick us up some
Big Belly Burger right now.

573
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,242
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

574
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,445
We just want to be friendly.

575
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,205
What, we scare you or something?

576
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,880
Yeah, I think you do.

577
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,651
Me, though, not so much.

578
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,171
Run.

579
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,167
Is that all you got, man? Huh? Is that it?

580
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,762
Where the hell did you come from?

581
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,564
Well, looks like Starling is back down
to only one man in a hood.

582
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,967
Then the three of us are back
in the archery business.

583
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,400
No.

584
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,485
I spent the past year trying
to avenge my father.

585
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,201
If we're gonna do this,
it has to be about honoring Tommy.

586
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,042
I need to become the man
he hoped I could be.

587
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,120
You two have helped me take the first step.

588
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,251
So, what's step two?

589
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,728
I'm game for anything
as long as it doesn't involve skydiving.

590
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,242
And I'm pretty down on landmines now too.

591
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,088
The city still needs saving.

592
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,801
But not by the Hood.

593
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,966
Not by some vigilante
who's just crossing names off a list.

594
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,964
It needs...

595
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,529
something more.

596
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,726
It needs a hero, Oliver.

597
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,843
Too bad the Hoods kind
of ruined your nickname.

598
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,481
No, it's good. I never...

599
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,882
I don't want to be
called the Hood anymore.

600
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,530
Okay.

601
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,724
So, what do you want to be called?
