00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:15,465
I realized that maybe the world
can't be saved.

323
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,467
What is it?

324
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,269
I just don't
believe who's here.

Queen.

326
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,581
I thought I told you
this party is 21 and over.

327
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,516
No worries.
I came prepared.

Laurel, how are you?

00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,889
I'm handling.
How's school?

331
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,725
Straight "A"
student.

332
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,127
I'm going to go
grab a drink.

Not alcoholic,
I swear.

Isn't this past
your bedtime?

337
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,437
Maybe I just need a little
something to keep me awake.

Holy crap.

343
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:23,466
You're Oliver Queen.
You're supposed to be dead.

People are going to believe--

Stay away
from my sister.

346
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:31,708
How'd you like
to be dead again?

How many people
are in this prison?

350
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:55,899
Maybe there's somebody
we can call for help?

351
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,267
Well, Slade
killed the guard.

352
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,968
There's one
other inmate.

He's not going
to be helpful.

354
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:02,939
Then how are we supposed
to get out of here?

355
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:06,376
This is a Chinese prison retrofitted
by eight A.R.G.U.S. technicians.

00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:08,211
There is no getting
out of here.

357
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:10,513
So what, we're just supposed
to sit here and starve to death?

358

That's your plan?

00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:20,424
- What?
- Wilson.

363
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:23,026
When he said that you were
still hiding something.

[Sighs] He's insane.

365
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:27,764
Yeah, I picked up on that.
I also picked up on how

366
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,232
you reacted when he said

367
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:32,302
that you were
keeping secrets from me.

368

Was he telling the truth?

369
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:38,775
I don't think that this is
the right time.

370
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:43,246
Actually, I think time is something
that we have a lot of right now.

371
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,316
Why didn't you
tell me about Sara?

- Come on, Thea...
- No, now that I know

373

about your secret, everything has become
a whole lot clearer.

374
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:54,724
And I can tell when you're hiding
something from me.

375

Like you are doing right now.

to stop treating me

like this tiny,
fragile, little object?

and I get killed,

then I lose any chance
I've ever had

of fixing all of the things
that I broke.

General Matthew Shrieve.

646
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:20,729
You've done your country
quite a service today,

647
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:22,130
Mr. Queen.

648
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:23,965
That said,
I've got some news

649
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,700
you're not going
to want to hear.

650
00:36:25,702 --> 00:36:28,203
Well, General, I'm used
to that by now.

651
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:30,405
We're going to need
to debrief you.

652
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:33,074
Back in China.

653
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:36,344
Once that's accomplished

654
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:39,514
and the Omega's secured,

655
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:42,751
I'll make sure you go any place
in the world you want to go.

656
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,955
Sound fair?

657
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,865
[Laurel laughs]

658
00:36:56,867 --> 00:37:00,168
Tommy Merlyn.

659
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,836
Are you stalking me?

660
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:03,638
Just checking on you.

661
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,707
Things with your
father seemed, uh,

662
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,308
they seemed tense.

663
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,310
Your roommate
told me

664
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:11,012
you were taking
a job here.

665
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:12,881
I said that
couldn't be true,

666
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:15,750
that you were going
to work for a white shoe firm.

667
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:17,852
Ah, I was.

668
00:37:17,854 --> 00:37:21,222
And then someone reminded me
why I became a lawyer in the first place.

669
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:23,992
You want to tell me
about it over dinner?

670
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:27,996
Hey, hey, hey,
it is just dinner.

671
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,499
How many girls have you used
those three little words with?

672
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,903
Those are the only three
little words I say.

673
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:38,907
Fine.

674
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:40,141
Just dinner.

675
00:37:40,143 --> 00:37:42,410
- Let's go.
- Maybe drinks.

676
00:37:42,412 --> 00:37:45,046
- Maybe.
- Ok.

677
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:09,103
Dad.

678
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:12,140
I didn't know that you were
going to be here.

679
00:38:12,142 --> 00:38:14,809
Where else would I be?

680
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:18,980
Got to think about a way
to tell your mom about this.

681
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:21,616
Um...

682
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:24,252
She already knows.

683
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:28,923
You weren't worried
about her heart giving out, then.

684
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:31,092
You know, if you were going
to drink tonight,

685
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:32,527
you would have
done it by now.

686
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:34,462
Really?

687
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:36,664
Are you going to get your mask
and your Billy club

688
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,399
and take it away
from me, huh?

689
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:41,102
- Black Canary?
- Dad!

690
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:42,470
When does your shift start,
huh? Shouldn't you be

691
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:43,638
running around
on rooftops by now?

692
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,607
Hey! Do you remember

693
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:48,109
when I was going to take
that corporate job in San Francisco?

694
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:50,411
Do you remember
what you said to me?

695
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,814
You were mad because I wasn't
choosing a life

696
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:54,282
where I was going
to help people.

697
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:56,684
It's like you knew.

698
00:38:56,686 --> 00:38:58,753
Already, even then.

699
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,357
You knew that my life was always
headed towards that mask.

700
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:05,326
Do you think that's what
I'm all torn up about?

701
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:11,733
The reason why I want
to open up this bottle

702
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:14,702
and want to crawl inside it is because
of what you did to us.

703
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:17,272
I loved your sister,
I loved your mom.

704
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:20,675
So much like each other,
and you know, these wild spirits.

705
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:22,377
But you and I,
we had something more,

706
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:24,379
'cause we were the ones
that were alike.

707
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:26,548
And we had a trust
and we had a bond,

708
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,483
and you broke it.

709
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:32,954
And I don't know
how you could do that to us.

710
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:37,058
Look, I'm going
to survive this.

711
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,663
I mean, I got to,
it's my baby girl.

712
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:44,799
But what you've done,

713
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,968
I don't know how
I'm going to live through this.

714
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,237
Daddy, I think we should
go to a meeting.

715
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,005
Yeah.

716
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:54,509
I'll go to the one
on Broxton.

717
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:57,011
You go to the one on Fourth.

718
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:16,898
[Thea inhales and exhales]

719
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:23,905
I need a shower.

720
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:25,940
I need ten showers.

721
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:28,142
Thea.

722
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:29,577
I'm fine.

723
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,713
I would be really,
really worried

724
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:33,014
if that were true.

725
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:35,817
What do you want
to hear?

726
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:37,585
Nothing.

727
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:40,421
And I don't want you
to tell anyone about this,

728
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:42,624
especially Laurel.

729
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:44,125
And why is that?

730
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,628
Because she loves you
like a sister,

731
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,563
and it would hurt
the both of you too much.

732
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:54,602
Does she know
about Malcolm?

733
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:56,604
No.

734
00:40:56,606 --> 00:41:00,208
No, that would
complicate things,

735
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,445
and despite everything
that he has done...

736
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,648
We still need him.

737
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,283
Malcolm: I agree.

738
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:11,753
I guess A.R.G.U.S. is
looking for a few guards

739
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:13,955
to volunteer
for island duty.

740
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:19,093
You almost
got us killed.

741
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:21,295
I simply had more faith
in you and my daughter

742
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:23,531
than you obviously
have for yourselves.

743
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:25,199
How could you
do that?

744
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:27,235
To challenge you,
to see if you both could work--

745
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:29,270
How could you
make me kill a friend?

746
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:31,939
He should not have
told you that.

747
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:33,408
I trusted you.

748
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,545
I let you
into my life.

749
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:41,749
How could you have
done this to me?

750
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:44,385
Because you are my daughter,
Thea, and I care about you.

751
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:45,887
Oh, God,
that's sick.

752
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:47,655
And not even
remotely true!

753
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:49,157
You do not understand

754
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,459
the danger we face
from Ra's al Ghul!

755
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:54,962
Just stop!
Stop using him as an excuse.

756
00:41:54,964 --> 00:41:58,566
The only person that I'm afraid of
right now is you.

757
00:41:58,568 --> 00:42:00,635
- Please, do not do this...
- Please, stop.

758
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:04,272
I will work with you
to stop Ra’s.

759
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,508
Because that's what my brother
says we need to do.

760
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,744
So I will be
your student.

761
00:42:09,746 --> 00:42:13,347
I'll be your partner.

762
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,083
Even if I have to,

763
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,185
I will be your soldier.

764
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,789
But never again will
I be your daughter.
