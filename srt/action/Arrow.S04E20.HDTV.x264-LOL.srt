1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:02,377
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,386 --> 00:00:03,918
After 5 years in Hell,

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,134
I returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:07,671
to save my city,

5
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:09,271
but my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:11,140
I had to become someone else.

7
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:12,308
I had to become

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,310
something else.

9
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:17,012
I had to become
the Green Arrow.

10
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:18,847
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:20,816
Those little
yellow pills you swallowed,

12
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,785
they do a few
interesting things,

13
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:25,754
including making
you cooperative.

14
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:27,256
Thanks to the algae
we engineered

15
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:29,024
from Star City bay,
the air down here

16
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,793
is now perfectly breathable.

17
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:32,428
Genesis is
almost ready.

18
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,796
We're much too close
to play games.

19
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:35,230
Do you remember
what I promised you?

20
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:36,498
A new beginning.

21
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,467
And you will have it

22
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,070
once we've brought
this world to its end.

23
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,405
Andy's working for Darhk,
has been the entire time.

24
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:45,140
Andy!

25
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:46,375
Your brother's way
beyond reach, Mr. Diggle.

26
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:47,476
If I'd listened
to you instead

27
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:48,677
of trusting
my brother,

28
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,712
Laurel would be
alive right now.

29
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:50,879
If Darhk wins,

30
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,114
Laurel died
for nothing.

31
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,515
He feels
unstoppable.

32
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:54,783
Because of his magic.

33
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:55,918
It's too strong.

34
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,186
You always find a way,

35
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:59,321
and you have to find
a way now.

36
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:04,460
Now is not the time
for panic.

37
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,395
We let him rot
in prison.

38
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:08,097
Clearly,
you overestimate

39
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,466
Damien Darhk's
capacity for forgiveness,

40
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:12,234
which is to say
that he has any.

41
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:14,169
Should Damien prove
to be unreasonable,

42
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:17,706
I have implemented
contingencies.

43
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,742
My buddies.

44
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,643
Long time, no see.

45
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:23,912
I brought my posse.
Hope you don't mind.

46
00:01:23,914 --> 00:01:25,381
What happened
to Ian and Judy?

47
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,216
They come down
with that nasty, little flu

48
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:28,484
that's been
going around?

49
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:30,753
Some were wary
of this meeting given that--

50
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,255
You all abandoned me
to my imprisonment?

51
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:34,723
I visited.

52
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:36,725
Someone should teach
this evil organization

53
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:39,228
a lesson in helping
their fellow man.

54
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,063
I'm sure it's all just a simple
misunderstanding.

55
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,098
After all, why
would I rely solely

56
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,500
on the word
of Malcolm Merlyn?

57
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:46,802
He can be so
underhanded.

58
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:47,936
Cute.

59
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,338
And our
illustrious council

60
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,240
has worked together
for such a very long time.

61
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:53,409
I'm glad that
we still have your trust.

62
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:55,210
Of course.
I had a lot of time

63
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:57,913
to reflect while
I was in prison,

64
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,115
mostly about religion
and bundt cake,

65
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,885
but after much thought,
I realized that--

66
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:05,054
oh, almost forgot.

67
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:08,624
Did my little incarceration
delay Genesis at all?

68
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:09,958
Uh, of course not.

69
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,096
Genesis is much bigger
than just one person.

70
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:17,399
Heh heh heh heh.

71
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:20,069
Gold star for you.

72
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,937
Where was I?
Oh, that's right.

73
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,639
My jailhouse epiphany.

74
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,208
If I could escape prison
without your help,

75
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,744
what do I need
any of you for?

76
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:35,584
Milo, you really have not been
paying attention, have you?

77
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,920
Unh!

78
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:40,322
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Unh!

79
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:43,358
Anyone else care to do
something stupid?

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
No takers?

81
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:47,162
Pity.

82
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:51,567
Ladies and gentlemen
and recently deceased,

83
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,737
it is time to begin
the final phase of Genesis.

84
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:05,647
Milo Armitage.

85
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:07,649
SCPD found him
in an alley

86
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:08,951
outside Ellendale,

87
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:11,687
and across town...

88
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:12,821
Phaedra Nixon.

89
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:14,056
Ok. So what
am I missing?

90
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:15,691
They were both HIVE.

91
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,059
You probably don't
recognize Phaedra and Milo

92
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,260
now that they're dead,
or maybe you were

93
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:19,628
too busy running
for your life, but--

94
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,296
They were with Darhk
when he held us hostage.

95
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:22,865
And now
they're dead.

96
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,500
What, so you think
crazy-pants Lonnie Machin's

97
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,034
back in town?

98
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:27,469
No. His grudge
is against Darhk, not HIVE.

99
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:29,471
You think Darhk
is cleaning house?

100
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:31,273
Well, HIVE didn't lift a finger
to break him out of Iron Heights.

101
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,674
That was all
Andy and Merlyn.

102
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,042
Ok. Well, if Darhk
is settling scores,

103
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:35,444
then now might be
the time to hit him.

104
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:37,646
We have seen how
powerful he is

105
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,114
I can't risk losing
anyone else.

106
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:40,549
We can't just sit on
our hands, Oliver.

107
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:41,850
We're not just sitting
on our hands,

108
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:43,452
but before we do
anything,

109
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,786
we need to know that
we can counteract his magic.

110
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,655
Well, is that
even possible?

111
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:48,457
I think it might be.

112
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,526
I was finally able
to get in touch with Constantine.

113
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,494
He put me on to
someone who he thinks

114
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:55,764
may be able to teach me how to defend
against Darhk's magic.

115
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,699
Ok. Well, I'm not
just saying this

116
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,067
because I love
"Harry Potter,"

117
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,637
but why are we not
all taking those lessons?

118
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,205
Well, it is easier
said than done

119
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:06,608
and apparently
quite dangerous.

120
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,179
So I have to go
to Hub City for a day or two.

121
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,346
Ok. In that case,

122
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:13,582
can I take the weekend
with Alex?

123
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:16,218
Kind of wants to go
away, clear our heads.

124
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,519
That sounds like
a good idea.

125
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:19,054
I think that--
actually, I think

126
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:20,923
everyone should take
a little time.

127
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:22,457
Lay low but stay
available,

128
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:26,361
and we will deal with Darhk
when I get back.

129
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,729
Ok.

130
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,036
Let him in.

131
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,742
Mind stepping out?

132
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,377
Hey, you.
How you holding up?

133
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,579
Mmm.

134
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:46,415
You've, um,
looked better.

135
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,250
Oh! Considering I've
spent two weeks

136
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,185
in a bomb-proof,
tungsten-encased bunker,

137
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,753
I think I look
pretty good.

138
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:52,921
Hmm.

139
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:54,623
You hungry?

140
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,925
Mmm. How long have
those been there?

141
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:58,227
That was lunch.

142
00:04:58,229 --> 00:04:59,494
Might have even
been today's.

143
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,096
Yeah. I think
I'll pass.

144
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:04,099
Oliver is leaving tonight on some
magical mystery tour,

145
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,768
wants me to stay put
and do nothing

146
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,970
until he comes back.

147
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:09,137
Magical mystery tour?

148
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,572
Yeah. It's a long story,

149
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:13,775
but the point of it is
is that he thinks

150
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:15,911
it's too dangerous to go
after Darhk or Andy

151
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:18,013
until he gets the right
magical know-how.

152
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,881
I can see you're
thrilled about that.

153
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,783
If you think
you have it bad,

154
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:23,051
try remembering
you're not the one

155
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:24,686
being held prisoner
in a metal box.

156
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,189
Oh, sweetheart.

157
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,657
We've talked
about this.

158
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,525
Andy has been
inside of Argus,

159
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:32,561
he's been inside
of our home.

160
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:33,829
It's too dangerous
for you to be

161
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,397
either place
right now.

162
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,201
I don't want you
any other place either.

163
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:46,942
Oh, I got you, baby,
I got you. Mmm.

164
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:48,977
Let my agents see
what they can find.

165
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:50,812
- Yeah.
- And as much as you

166
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:52,814
don't want
to hear it,

167
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,150
Oliver has a point.

168
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,652
HIVE is too
dangerous for you

169
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,153
to go off
half-cocked, John.

170
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:00,555
Oh, it's always serious
when you call me John.

171
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:03,458
Well, John, why don't
you make yourself useful

172
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,527
by grabbing some
diapers while you're out?

173
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,196
We're running low and I hate asking
my people to get them.

174
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:11,667
You got it.

175
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,001
Back in a hour?

176
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:14,036
Or less.

177
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:18,640
Say, "bye, daddy."
Say, "bye-bye. Bye-bye."

178
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,225
You've been living
down here.

179
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:39,895
Ahem. It seemed to
make the most sense.

180
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,263
Where's all your stuff?

181
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:42,531
It's in storage.
You know me.

182
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,699
I don't need much.

183
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,200
Maybe, like, a plant,

184
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:47,202
like a...Fern
or something.

185
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,904
They thrive
in places like this.

186
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:50,205
How could I forget?

187
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,241
Come to see me off.

188
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:54,843
You were pretty stingy
on the details

189
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,546
about this "magic tutor"
Constantine referred you to.

190
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,314
It is sort of
my M.O.

191
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:02,551
Don't talk to me
like I'm other people.

192
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:04,286
What has you
so worried?

193
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:07,689
Darhk's idol, the type of magic
that he's using,

194
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:10,859
I've seen it take
good people

195
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:13,762
and turn them dark,
soulless,

196
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,430
almost inhuman.

197
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:17,299
And you're afraid
that's gonna happen to you?

198
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,101
There's an argument
to be made that I'm already there.

199
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,870
-That's not funny.
-I am not joking.

200
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:26,041
There is no length
that I will not go to

201
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:28,844
to avenge Laurel,

202
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:32,481
to stop Darhk from hurting anyone
ever again,

203
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:35,817
and I honestly don't
know where that path will lead.

204
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,052
I'm coming with you.

205
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:40,122
Felicity--

206
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,556
just because we're
not together

207
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:43,625
doesn't mean you have
to do this alone,

208
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,093
and I've already chartered
the company jet.

209
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:47,095
Mr. Dennis is furious,
and I booked us a room--

210
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:50,399
rooms...with points.

211
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,467
Should I even try
and talk you out of this?

212
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:53,568
No. You met
my mother.

213
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,138
Heh. Same DNA.

214
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,600
Did you see
anyone else here?

215
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,002
Which way?

216
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:29,070
Get out of here now.

217
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,283
What the hell?

218
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:44,953
Sorry, man...

219
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,521
But I'm not playing
anymore!

220
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:50,559
Hoo! You still got those
quick reflexes, John.

221
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,294
Too bad they couldn't
save your partner.

222
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,995
Don't you dare say
anything about her!

223
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:55,163
Well, you've got a gun.

224
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,531
Make me!

225
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:18,087

227
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,999
Hey, honey.
It's a little tough

228
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,234
for me to talk
right now!

229
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,402
You'll want to
hear this.

230
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,270
Satellite track
just picked up Andy.

231
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,905
Unh!

232
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,540
Let me guess.
He's somewhere south of Main

233
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,841
between Grammercy
and Addison, right?

234
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,310
How do you know that?

235
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,844
Because I'm trading
shots with him right now.

236
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,780
- Johnny.
- You can yell at me later.

237
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,014
Just send backup.

238
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,916
He's at the Grammercy
Power Plant.

239
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,285
How soon can
your men get here?

240
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,653
5 minutes, 10 tops.

241
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,255
That's too long.

242
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,756
Johnny, you need to wait.

243
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,792
You have no tactical
advantage in there.

244
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,894
Lyla, I can't wait.
If I do, he gets away.

245
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,028
I can't let that happen,
not again.

246
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,430
Your judgment
is compromised.

247
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,065
Maybe it is,

248
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,334
but it doesn't mean
I'm wrong. Get here!

249
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,737
Johnny!

250
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,905
Johnny!

251
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,478
So what exactly are
we looking for?

252
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,380
High roller room.

253
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,581
When you said that you'd found
someone  to teach you magic,

254
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,650
I was thinking, like,
a mountaintop

255
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,885
or a hidden temple,
not Hub City's

256
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,655
premier underground
casino.

257
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,645
Well, with Constantine,

258
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:27,685
I have learned to
expect the unexpected.

259
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,495
I'm betting on Fortuna.

260
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,000
Now he was a little bit
vague with the specifics.

261
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,434
He just said...

262
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,337
"Pitch game,
first base, mate.

263
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,639
See if you're worthy."

264
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,942
Wow. Ok. Pitch game,
Blackjack.

265
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,410
Uh, dealer using
up to two decks.

266
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,945
Mm-hmm.

267
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,147
First base, first seat
on the dealer's left.

268
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,082
I think we're
in the right place.

269
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,652
I'm not so sure that
finding this guy depends on gambling.

270
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,421
It's not gambling
when I play.

271
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,202
Alex?

272
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,489
Hello?

273
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,024
Alex?

274
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,234
Alex?

275
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,969
Hey. Morning.

276
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,839
And here I thought you were
gonna sleep past breakfast.

277
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,376
I--I almost did.

278
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,479
I'm so foggy.

279
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,947
Yeah. You were
exhausted.

280
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,616
You passed out 5 minutes after we
left the city.

281
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,786
Oh. Guess I was
really tired.

282
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,355
See? It just proves
how badly you needed this trip.

283
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,824
We both did.

284
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,027
You ready for some
famous eggs Benedict?

285
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,795
You poached eggs?

286
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,497
Hey. I'm not just
a cutthroat political operative.

287
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,733
I contain multitudes.

288
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,736
Mm-hmm, and you also
wear a very mean apron.

289
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,271
Well, you should see
what I have on underneath.

290
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,773
Mmm. Ha ha!

291
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,011
I forgot how good
you were at this.

292
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,180
Oh, like riding
a bike.

293
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,016
Rough beat.

294
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,651
Indeed. I should
probably head home soon

295
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,453
before they take
my shoes.

296
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,921
Oh. Well, you never know
when your luck's gonna change.

297
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,357
Trust me.

298
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,060
That's so kind.
Muchas gracias.

299
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,394
De nada.

300
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,532
Oh, boom!
Come to mama!

301
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,468
Ahem. I mean...What?

302
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,070
I'm starting to think
that this guy's

303
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,672
gonna be a no-show.

304
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,709
It's because he's
not a guy, amor.

305
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,078
Esrin Fortuna.

306
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,348
Tell John Constantine
he still owes me money.

307
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,162
Stay right where you
are, you son of a bitch.

308
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,429
It's funny.

309
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,400
I was gonna tell
you the same thing.

310
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,835
Unh!

311
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,305
Ugh.

312
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,940
Bravo, John.

313
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,109
You played the script
out perfectly.

314
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,644
What the hell are
you talking about?

315
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,978
Oh, don't worry
about it.

316
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,281
I'll explain
everything

317
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,282
after you wake up.

318
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:50,481
I'm sorry this place
isn't as fancy

319
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:53,517
as the cage you kept
me in for 3 months.

320
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,986
Where the hell am I?

321
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,821
You got
bigger worries.

322
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:59,690
Mr. Darhk is
on his way.

323
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,325
To do what?

324
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:03,394
Well, he's not coming
here to play gin rummy.

325
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,195
I'm supposed to
prep you.

326
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:15,873
Glad to see you're picking up your
psycho boss' old habits.

327
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,975
I'm sorry,
but is the man

328
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:20,411
that locked me up in a cage
and beat me half to death

329
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:22,312
questioning
my savior's orders?

330
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:24,081
Damien Darhk is
no one's savior.

331
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,883
He's a liar
and a monster.

332
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,651
The Romans said
the same thing about Jesus.

333
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:30,154
Just do whatever you're
gonna do, man.

334
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:32,089
Do it!

335
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:35,325
Wow. There's that
temper I remember.

336
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:36,927
You know, it's
a good thing that Sara's

337
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,696
not gonna have to grow up
with it like I did.

338
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:40,898
Keep my daughter's name
out of your mouth!

339
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,335
How could you do this
to everyone again for a second time?

340
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:48,439
Oh. Oh, I know
what you're doing.

341
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:54,044
You're referring
to my former wife and son.

342
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:58,082
I left that life
a long time ago, John.

343
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,983
You can't even say
their names.

344
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:03,454
Carly, Andy Jr.

345
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:06,423
They were your family.

346
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:07,958
They still are.

347
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,093
My family...

348
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,730
is HIVE.

349
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:15,499
Unh!

350
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,702
Argggh! Gaaah!

351
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:23,741
Ok. So since Oliver
doesn't seem to want to ask it, um--

352
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:26,410
Why is an immortal shaman
playing Blackjack

353
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,479
in Hub City's
premier underground casino?

354
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:30,581
Excuse me?
Immort--immortal?

355
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,416
You see any wrinkles
on my face?

356
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,318
And shaman.

357
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,786
A shaman is someone
who has influence

358
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:38,489
in the world of good
and evil spirits.

359
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:41,258
Blackjack is just
a hobby.

360
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,693
This way.

361
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,330
Planning on teaching
me magic

362
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:48,632
in the back room
of a casino?

363
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:51,435
You want to learn
the dark arts, Mr. Queen,

364
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:53,470
we cannot do that here.

365
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,351
Whoa! This is by far
the coolest high roller room

366
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:08,986
I have ever seen.

367
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:11,455
We've left the casino
behind, amor,

368
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:13,590
and that plane
of existence.

369
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:14,825
I've been
in a chamber like this before

370
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:17,261
on an island named
Lian Yu.

371
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:20,230
Yes. Lian Yu is
a place of Nexus

372
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:21,532
just like your home.

373
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:23,066
Star City?

374
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:26,703
Hmm. There's a Nexus
chamber there, as well.

375
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:29,106
Wait. You didn't think
it was a coincidence

376
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:30,841
that Damien Darhk chose
that city?

377
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,576
You know Darhk?

378
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:35,312
I wouldn't be much
of a shaman if I didn't.

379
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:38,148
Special brand
of nasty loco that one is.

380
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,283
Mmm.

381
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:40,517
So if you know
Darhk,

382
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,718
why haven't you
tried to end him?

383
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,287
That's not the way
of things.

384
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:45,656
We immortals tend to stay
out of the affairs of men.

385
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:47,724
Unless someone
owes you money.

386
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:51,862
Recognize this
handsome gent?

387
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,463
Darhk has a similar idol.

388
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:54,731
It gives him
his power.

389
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:58,836
Uh-uh. It only
channels it.

390
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,838
Darhk's power comes
from--

391
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,173
Death.

392
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,741
The more people he kills,

393
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:06,643
the more powerful
he becomes.

394
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:09,313
Not just a pretty
face this guy.

395
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:10,848
Yeah. Except Oliver's
not gonna go kill a bunch of people

396
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,184
just to be on the same
level playing field as Darhk.

397
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,520
All things have
their opposite.

398
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:19,122
Darhk draws
his power

399
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:22,059
from fear and death.

400
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,061
Its opposite is
light and hope,

401
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:28,765
la Luz Del Alma,
light of the soul.

402
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:32,803
If you can channel
la Luz Del Alma,

403
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:37,207
you will be able to
repel Darhk's magic.

404
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:39,743
Then that is what
I'm here to learn.

405
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:43,513
I wish it were
just that easy.

406
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:46,250
If the darkness
inside you

407
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:48,785
outweighs the light,

408
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:51,588
instead of repelling
Darhk's magic,

409
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,892
you will end up
fueling it.

410
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:58,962
You will only make
him more powerful.

411
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:07,140
Are you getting
a signal?

412
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:10,075
Nope. That's one of the benefits
of being on vacation.

413
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:13,245
Oh. I just wanted
to call my brother.

414
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:16,015
You ok? Seem to be
having trouble relaxing.

415
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:18,884
Yeah. No. I'm--

416
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,319
you're probably gonna
think it's stupid.

417
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:23,489
Oh, I can pretty much
guarantee that I won't.

418
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:27,193
It's--it's this place.

419
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:29,695
It just seems
too perfect.

420
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,298
Ha! Oh. It sounds like
it's been way too long

421
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,500
since you've left
the city.

422
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:36,035
Yeah, maybe.

423
00:18:39,073 --> 00:18:41,273
Do you hear that?

424
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:44,410
Yeah. I think people
call that nature.

425
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:45,411
No. That's--

426
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:48,981
That's not it.

427
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,983
It...

428
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:53,586
I, uh...

429
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,788
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just tired,

430
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:02,027
but it--it sounds like everything is
on a loop right now.

431
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:04,763
Does that sound crazy?
That--that's crazy.

432
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:07,333
Only a little, yeah.

433
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,368
Look. I think this
is just the last bit

434
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,239
of you trying to
fight this vacation.

435
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:14,340
Yeah.

436
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:17,409
Hey. Let all
that go.

437
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:20,079
Just be happy, ok?

438
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:21,847
Ok.

439
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,350
I sure am.

440
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,185
- Ok.
- All right.

441
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:31,156
It's time.

442
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:33,092
I know this feels
personal, John,

443
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:34,627
but it isn't.

444
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,896
What's happening is just
what has to happen.

445
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:43,602
Rah!

446
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,453
Do it.

447
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:04,623
Do it for Laurel.

448
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,635
She'd be so
disappointed in you.

449
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:19,271
The only reason why
you're still breathing

450
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:21,740
is because one of us
is still human.

451
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:32,985
I'll hit you with a low dose
of Darhk's magic,

452
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:35,654
and then we'll take it
up from there.

453
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:38,424
Don't I need an idol
or a totem?

454
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:41,994
The tattoo Constantine
gave you does many things.

455
00:20:41,996 --> 00:20:43,696
Are you ready?

456
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:44,997
Yeah.

457
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:46,432
I'm--I'm sorry.

458
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:49,201
I just--I just thought that these
magic lessons

459
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:52,938
would have, you know, more
lessons.

460
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,909
Magic is a manipulation
of primordial energies,

461
00:20:56,911 --> 00:21:00,145
primordial as
in prelinguistic.

462
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:03,649
You'll probably want
to take a few steps back, amor.

463
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:05,017
Hmm?

464
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:14,159
Two sides of you--
darkness, light.

465
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:15,995
Focus on the light.

466
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,343
Good, but that might
be, as they call, beginner's luck,

467
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:34,647
so let's kick it up
a notch or two, hmm?

468
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:48,227
The darkness
and light are within you.

469
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:52,364
In truth, you are only
fighting yourself.

470
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,733
The friends you've failed,

471
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:57,069
the people you've killed,

472
00:21:57,071 --> 00:22:01,440
they have no place
in this.

473
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:03,842
Don't give in.

474
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,778
Cast aside your doubt,

475
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,015
resist your darkness.

476
00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:17,022
Unh!

477
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:29,642
What happened?

478
00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:30,297
He's not ready.

479
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:31,764
I'll get it,
I'll get it.

480
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,232
Now let's go again.

481
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:34,967
I could give you
an infinite number of tries.

482
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,135
It wouldn't change
a thing.

483
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:38,771
What? No.
I can do this.

484
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:41,574
I told you
if the darkness within you

485
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:42,808
is greater
than the light,

486
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,045
you will only make
your enemy stronger.

487
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,447
You've seen what's
inside of you, yeah?

488
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:52,217
Tell me, what could
I possibly teach you

489
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:55,688
that would change
what you saw?

490
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,959
Wait. So that's it?
It's over?

491
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,361
There's nothing
I can do for him.

492
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:15,227
It's not even getting
dark out.

493
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,762
What's that?

494
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,277
It's 8:00,
and it's raining outside,

495
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,478
but it's still
light out.

496
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,348
We're up north
and...

497
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,451
Seriously, what's
gotten into you?

498
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:29,754
You never even told me
where we were going...

499
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:34,659
And how can you not
hear that?

500
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,194
Thea, come on.

501
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:37,261
We've been
over this.

502
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:38,329
Seriously, listen.

503
00:23:38,331 --> 00:23:39,297
There's 3 chirps...

504
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,734
Then a bark,
then 4 chirps,

505
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,569
and then it just keeps
repeating itself twice.

506
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:46,938
Ok. I think what's
happening here

507
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,606
is you're
beyond stressed.

508
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:50,675
No, ok, Alex.
I am not stressed out.

509
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:51,809
Just listen.

510
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:57,548
There's gonna be a bark
right...Now.

511
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,825
Since when did you start
taking vitamins--

512
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,997
Now you're worried
about my vitamins.

513
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,066
Where did you get
those?

514
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:18,569
Ruvé. She said
I needed to stay healthy.

515
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:29,147
Alex...Where are we?

516
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:33,851
Is--is the reason that
I don't remember anything

517
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:35,286
because you...

518
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:40,158
Did you drug me?

519
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,360
Thea, now you're
talking crazy, ok?

520
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:44,929
- No, I can't.
- Where are you going?

521
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:47,498
Thea!

522
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:51,135
What the hell,
Johnny?!

523
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:52,537
I told you
to stand down!

524
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:55,139
I know, I know,
but I couldn't.

525
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:56,774
You could have
been killed!

526
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,309
I couldn't stand down, not
after what he did.

527
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:00,144
Then you are going to
make an orphan of your daughter

528
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:01,579
because you are not
seeing straight.

529
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,015
That's why tonight
went south!

530
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:08,519
Shh.

531
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,555
Lyla, listen.
I know I--

532
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:12,089
I know I messed up.

533
00:25:12,091 --> 00:25:13,457
I--I know my head
isn't on right,

534
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:18,095
but--but he's
my brother,

535
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:21,966
and Laurel, she--
she was like a sister.

536
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:25,736
I know,
and it's horrible,

537
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:28,873
but right now, Johnny, you are
not acting like the man I married.

538
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,908
You're the man
I divorced.

539
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,049
Lyla, look.
I just wanted to help him,

540
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:39,417
to bring
my brother back.

541
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,552
Then bring him
to justice,

542
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,855
but do it
the right way.

543
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:47,458
I will.

544
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:50,361
I will.

545
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:58,469
We'll find someone else
to teach you magic,

546
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:01,372
someone with more patience
and less smelly incense.

547
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:03,708
She was right,
you know?

548
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,876
It's not
about the magic.

549
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:06,444
It's about me.

550
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:07,778
If she didn't see
anything worthy inside you,

551
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,547
she never would
have dealt with us.

552
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:12,350
She didn't deal with us.
She dealt with you.

553
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,885
She didn't reveal
herself until you

554
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,319
offered her
your chips,

555
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:17,188
and that has always
been the way with us.

556
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,858
Felicity, you are
the one who brings the light.

557
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,861
You know, I told you
that I've seen

558
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:26,264
magic that's turned
good people dark,

559
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:30,534
but all Fortuna did was
show me who I really am.

560
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:33,404
Don't do this.

561
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:35,339
Every time you face
a setback,

562
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:37,208
you throw yourself
a pity party.

563
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,045
It's not a pity party.
It's acceptance.

564
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:42,179
You said it yourself.

565
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:45,583
No matter what I do,

566
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:49,153
I'm always gonna revert back
to the person I became on the island.

567
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:52,990
Yeah. When I said that,
I was hurt.

568
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:57,267
I was going through one of the most
painful experiences of my life.

569
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:59,903
No, Oliver,
you're not perfect.

570
00:26:59,905 --> 00:27:03,206
None of us are.

571
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,910
The good is that
all of us can change.

572
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,085
Hmm.

573
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:18,121
Poowr widdle
Andy Diggle.

574
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:22,158
Did your big brother
knock your noggin?

575
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,229
Heh heh heh heh.

576
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:30,066
Bravo. Your performance
was pitch perfect.

577
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:31,301
Thank you, sir.

578
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:33,203
I assume the tracker's
in place.

579
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:35,171
We've already locked
in on his location.

580
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:39,409
Well, then I believe
it's time for one last family reunion.

581
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:46,683
Oh, come on.

582
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:48,785
You're a bigger baby
than Sara.

583
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:50,420
Ouch.

584
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:52,422
Is there anything else
you can tell me about their lockup?

585
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:57,027
Yeah. The place could
have really used some central heating.

586
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:59,162
No. It was strange.

587
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:02,032
Torture just doesn't seem like
the right play.

588
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:03,833
Why not just kill me?

589
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:06,436
What's that?

590
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:08,138
Proximity alarm.

591
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:19,583
Sweetheart, make sure
Sara's strapped in really tight.

592
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,493
- How's Sara?
- She's ok.

593
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:39,498
It's director Michaels.
We have a code black.

594
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:01,898
We have
two more bogeys.

595
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:03,198
How the hell
did they find us?

596
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,833
It's me. Andy let me go.

597
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:06,334
He probably tagged me
with a tracker.

598
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:08,036
You can blame yourself
after we get out of this.

599
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,738
You mean if we get
out of this.

600
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,673
Where's your backup?

601
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,875
HIVE has them engaged
elsewhere--

602
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,410
Argus headquarters.

603
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:17,546
- Where's your team?
- They're not answering.

604
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,282
So much for "stay
available."

605
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:21,416
We're on our own.

606
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:34,062
This rig was designed
to withstand just about anything.

607
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,600
Does that include magic?

608
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:49,811
It's me he's after.

609
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:51,179
I'll draw him out.

610
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:52,948
No!

611
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,117
If you were Darhk's objective,
he already had you.

612
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,786
He wanted you to
lead him to me.

613
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:59,154
What are you
talking about?

614
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:00,422
You need to get
out of here now.

615
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,590
Lyla, I'm not
leaving you.

616
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,291
Johnny, I am not
Amanda Waller.

617
00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:04,759
If they use you
against me,

618
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,828
I will give them
whatever they want.

619
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,597
I need you both safe.

620
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,850
That was a fun bit
of business.

621
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:30,151
Get him.

622
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,850
You are a feisty
one, Ms. Michaels.

623
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,385
You had your fun.

624
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:05,287
It's time for me
to have mine.

625
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:08,950
Oh, it's been a while since I've
hit anybody with this thing.

626
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:10,585
I didn't think you
got my message.

627
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:12,887
Sorry we're late.
Oliver's on Lyla and Darhk.

628
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,055
Baby Sara?

629
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,757
- All right.
- Yeah.

630
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,925
- You got her?
- Yeah, yeah.

631
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:18,059
Ok.

632
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,127
Ok, ok.

633
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,495
All right.

634
00:32:20,497 --> 00:32:21,930
Ok.

635
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:31,072
It's a small world,
isn't it?

636
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,942
Your bother-in-law being
my loyal servant.

637
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:35,910
Thanksgiving at your home
is gonna be

638
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,480
so interesting
this year.

639
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,516
Ha ha ha!

640
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:44,119
Agggghh!

641
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:00,101
Unh!

642
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:04,873
You seem like a likable guy,
Oliver.

643
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,674
I bet you've got
a lot of friends.

644
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:09,978
I'm gonna enjoy killing every
last one of them.

645
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,614
No. Never again.

646
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,901
Bet you regret not pulling that trigger
the first time around.

647
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:42,006
What are you gonna
do, John?

648
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:47,211
Agh! Unh!

649
00:33:49,548 --> 00:33:52,282
After Laurel, I left
you alone to grieve.

650
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:53,684
I was being nice.

651
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:55,619
You have no idea how
much I hate being nice.

652
00:33:55,621 --> 00:33:57,021
Unh!

653
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,740
Agghhh!

654
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,013
It isn't over.

655
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:24,548
You haven't been
paying attention, Andy.

656
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,484
Darhk got out,
I got out.

657
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:29,420
I'll get out again.

658
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:33,557
That mobile safe house you
got looked really homey.

659
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,661
Bet it will get cramped
when Sara gets older.

660
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:39,029
Shut up.

661
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:41,031
She's got to go
to school eventually,

662
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:44,468
and Lyla, well, you
can't watch her 24/7.

663
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,769
I said shut
your mouth, Andy.

664
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:47,805
Shut your damn mouth!

665
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:51,141
You're the one who's obviously not
paying attention

666
00:34:51,143 --> 00:34:52,876
because this is war.

667
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,045
And women, children,

668
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:57,214
they're expendable
in your war?

669
00:34:57,216 --> 00:34:59,917
Genesis is coming, John.

670
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:04,588
Lyla and Sara won't be the only women
and children who die.

671
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,326
Tell me, how's it feel
knowing that

672
00:35:09,328 --> 00:35:10,961
you had no problem
pulling the trigger

673
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:14,164
to protect a bunch
of Afghanis that you never knew,

674
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,133
but you don't have
the guts

675
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:17,634
to do what's necessary

676
00:35:17,636 --> 00:35:19,536
to protect your own
wife and child?

677
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:51,121
Uh...

678
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:53,990
How's Lyla?

679
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:56,760
Um...

680
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:58,261
She's fine.

681
00:35:58,263 --> 00:35:59,996
She--she's, um--

682
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:02,566
she's unconscious,
but--but she's fine.

683
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:04,401
Felicity's taking
her and Sara back.

684
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:08,138
Darhk is--Darhk's
in the wind.

685
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,242
John, what happened?

686
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,214
He was never gonna
back off of us.

687
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:24,354
My family...

688
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,056
They were never
gonna be safe.

689
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:37,868
Hey.

690
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,670
Hi.

691
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:42,205
Did you get in touch
with Thea?

692
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:44,808
Not yet.

693
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,643
You ok?

694
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:49,346
Phew.

695
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:52,349
Earlier with Darhk,
it worked.

696
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:53,617
He tried to use
his magic on me,

697
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:55,786
and I was able
to repel it.

698
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:58,288
That's incredible.

699
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,656
How'd you do it?

700
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:07,931
I heard your voice
in my head,

701
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:10,100
and you were reminding me
of all of the good things

702
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,570
that I have
in my life.

703
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:15,772
I heard Thea,
I heard John.

704
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,776
I heard Laurel...

705
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:24,281
Just telling me
to keep fighting,

706
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,484
to never give up,

707
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:29,686
just telling me
to have hope.

708
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,200
Hey.

709
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:45,302
Sara? Where's Sara?

710
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,170
She's fine,
she's fine.

711
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:48,371
Felicity took her
to Donna's.

712
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:49,606
She--she's ok.

713
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,013
But something's
wrong.

714
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:09,826
I, um--I had to
put him down, Lyla.

715
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,731
Andy.

716
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:17,434
Oh.

717
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:20,403
I had to kill
my baby brother.

718
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:24,708
He wasn't a brother
to you, Johnny,

719
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,743
not in the ways
that really matter.

720
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:30,447
What happened?

721
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:39,556
He reached for my gun.

722
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:44,561
I didn't have a choice.

723
00:38:56,074 --> 00:38:57,240
Oh, no.

724
00:38:57,242 --> 00:38:58,375
No, no, no, no.

725
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,676
What?

726
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:03,680
It's gone.

727
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:07,918
Darhk took it.

728
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,519
Took what?

729
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,624
Rubicon.

730
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:16,593
I thought Rubicon
was being stored at Argus.

731
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:20,730
It was until Shadowspire
tried to steal it.

732
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:22,699
After Waller's death,
I had it moved

733
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:23,967
for security reasons.

734
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:25,302
To where?

735
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:28,138
It was under your skin?

736
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,373
A subdermal implant.

737
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:31,675
Darhk ripped it out.

738
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:35,612
Lyla, you need to
tell us what Rubicon is.

739
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:38,048
A ballistic launch
override protocol

740
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,383
designed to prevent
any country, even our own,

741
00:39:40,385 --> 00:39:42,185
from firing
a nuclear missile.

742
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:45,455
Something tells me
Darhk's plans aren't so benign.

743
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,629
With some work
and the right expertise,

744
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:54,898
Rubicon could be corrupted.

745
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,567
Instead of controlling nukes to
prevent them from being launched--

746
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,135
Oh, my God.

747
00:39:59,137 --> 00:40:00,637
Darhk would control the world's
nuclear stockpile.

748
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,639
To what end?

749
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:04,307
I don't mean to apply
logic to a bad guy's plot here,

750
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:06,776
but Darhk destroys
the world, then what?

751
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:08,078
He'd be ruler
of nothing.

752
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,313
Unless he wants
to rebuild.

753
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:12,649
Andy told me that
Genesis was coming.

754
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:14,050
I don't think so.
Phil Collins said

755
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:15,385
they'd never tour again.

756
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:18,388
The old testament,
the book of "Genesis."

757
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,957
God wanted to give the world a do-over,
so he destroyed it.

758
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:23,093
He destroyed it
with a flood.

759
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:24,995
Rubicon is
Darhk's flood.

760
00:40:31,336 --> 00:40:34,337
So nuclear
annihilation is Darhk's flood.

761
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:37,107
What's he planning
on building as his ark?

762
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:22,569

<font color="#00FFFF">@elder_man</font>

763
00:41:39,022 --> 00:41:41,022
Greg!
Move your head.
