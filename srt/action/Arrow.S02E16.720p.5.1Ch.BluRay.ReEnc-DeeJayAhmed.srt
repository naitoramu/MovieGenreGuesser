2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,600
My name is Oliver Queen.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,485
After five years on a hellish island...

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,286
I have come home with only one goal:

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,891
To save my city.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,410
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,240
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,969
I must be something else.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,281
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,124
In Afghanistan, my unit was...

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,449
tasked with protecting Gholem Qadir.
Sold opium. Sold children.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,404
How do you think your brother died?

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,127
- You shot at a client, you missed.
- I don't miss.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,443
- You murdered Shado.
- Yes, I pulled the trigger.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,563
But you, you aimed the gun.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,051
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,084
Five years ago, I made you a promise.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,407
You cannot die...

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,323
until you have known complete despair.
And you will, I promise.

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,641
Sara?

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,685
Sara?

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,845
Murderer.

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,361
Alexi.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,130
What can I do for you?
There's no gulags here in Starling City.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,011
Ha-ha-ha. Anatoli talks too much.

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,284
I need you to find a man for me.

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,327
His name is Slade Wilson. He's rich,
Australian, and he's missing an eye.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,285
I need to know where he sleeps.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,404
First I need your assistance
with my business.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,121
There is a man who owes me
a substantial amount of money.

31
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,608
- I am not here to trade.
- You know how our brotherhood works.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,000
I do a favor for you and you do one for me.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,924
Put it on my tab, Alexi.

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,244
I don't have time for these games.

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,000
Make time.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,727
My services are of no use to you
unless yours are use to me.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,610
Okay.

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,604
I know exactly how this brotherhood works,
and right now it works for me.

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,963
- I woke up and you were gone.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,486
I wasn't tired.

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,766
You should be.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,247
When was the last time you actually slept?

43
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,370
Right before I found out that Slade Wilson
is still alive.

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,846
Do you wanna talk?

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,648
I mean, I know neither one of us are very
good about sharing our feelings, but...

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
I mean, I get it.

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,481
Slade...

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,847
It's a lot. And, you know,
it's okay if you're scared. I am too.

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,485
I'm not scared.

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,322
Slade came back to Starling City
with an agenda.

51
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,648
First, he tries to
mass-produce the Mirakuru.

52
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,289
Then he shows up at my mother's house.

53
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,807
So he wants a fight?
Fine, I'll give him a fight.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,528
And this time when I kill him, I will make
damn sure that he stays dead.

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,281
I just need to find him.

56
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,361
- Coffee? Mm.
- Hot cocoa.

57
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,686
What, no marshmallows?

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,849
- I'm out.
- Mm.

59
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,765
What are you doing here, Dig?

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,610
- Just keeping an eye on things.
- Okay...

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,564
and by "things," you mean my neck.

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,485
The one you think Slade Wilson's
going to break in my sleep.

63
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,170
Yeah, something like that.

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,165
Look, I have extra security details on
Oliver's mother...

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,684
Roy's keeping an eye on Thea,
Sara's staying close to Laurel.

66
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,769
So I get you...

67
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,851
sitting outside my house like that lacrosse
player my freshman year of college.

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,485
You know, I had a life before
you and Oliver. You know?

69
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,284
Right.

70
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,624
I just wanna make sure
you're okay, Felicity.

71
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,906
And I love you for it.

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,289
But if Slade wants to kill me, he can.

73
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,723
There's nothing you can do to stop him.

74
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,287
So go home.

75
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,887
Okay?

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,605
Hey.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,170
Nice jammies.

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,481
What took you so long?

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,404
What is all this?

80
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,007
A little early for
champagne, don't you think?

81
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,769
Not for me.

82
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,367
I just got back from a
mission in Pyongyang.

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,125
Well, damn.

84
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,000
That was you?

85
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,771
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,691
- That's classified information.
- Ah.

87
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,166
But I missed my ex-husband, new boyfriend.

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,009
And A.R.G.U.S. has a standing reservation
at this hotel for very important assets.

89
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,164
- Mm
- Can you stay?

90
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,961
Oh, well, Oliver and I kind of have a...

91
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,808
situation.

92
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,730
Everything all right?

93
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,322
Yeah. Yeah, it's... Yeah.

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,447
So you can stay.

95
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,850
Mm.

96
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,285
Hey.

97
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,482
- Is there a problem, Michaels?
- We need to rest. These women are tired.

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,411
We're all tired.
It's a long hike back to camp. Keep going.

99
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,809
Shall I go explain to the ladies
why they wanna get back before dark?

100
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,690
They're not allowed to talk to you.

101
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,008
- Because I'm an American?
- Because you're a man.

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,440
Five minutes.

103
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,407
Ugh. Girls in the military.

104
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,887
Can't keep up, don't join up, right?

105
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,447
Whoa, whoa. Hey, what's going on here?

106
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,801
What's going on?

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,286
You recognize that face?

108
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,126
You should.

109
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,926
He's on the U.S. military's
high-value target list.

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,761
Gholem Qadir.
Opium drug lord and arms dealer.

111
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,129
Wanted alive.

112
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,811
What were you saying about women
in the military?

113
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,165
Why didn't we do fun stuff like this
when we were married?

114
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,920
And take time from our busy schedule
of driving each other crazy?

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,285
- Amanda.
- Don't look so worried, Agent Michaels.

116
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,446
We've all availed ourselves of the Ostrander
suite at some point in our careers.

117
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,806
Something's come up,
I'll need you to come with me.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,729
- Duty calls.
- Yeah, guess so.

119
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,164
Actually, I meant both of you.

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,211
What are we looking at here?

121
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,290
- Hydroxy-Cyclosarin.
- It's a nerve agent.

122
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,680
It's the apocalypse in the form
of a chemical weapon.

123
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,962
And it's about to hit the open market.

124
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,050
A.R.G.U.S. agents uncovered a
manufacturing plant in Kahndaq.

125
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,646
All samples were accounted for,
except for one.

126
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,448
Two weeks later, this footage was captured
in a remote village in Southern Qurac.

127
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,881
One milliliter has a
kill radius of 10 miles.

128
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,646
It only took half that amount to produce
these results.

129
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,243
Our sources have traced the sample through
Europe, to an estate in Markovia.

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,487
So send in the Army.

131
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,571
We send in the Army, we risk an international
spectacle our government can't afford.

132
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,081
This has to be off-book.

133
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,164
If you need me to draw up
a smash-and-grab, done.

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,245
But John isn't a field agent.

135
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,646
He's not qualified.

136
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,684
Judging from how he and Oliver Queen
spend their free time...

137
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,405
I'd say his credits transfer.

138
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,490
Hey look, I don't want this thing out in
the open any more than you do...

139
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,729
but I'm not sending my boss on
another of your business trips.

140
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,890
I have no intention of involving the Arrow.

141
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,770
- I need you.
- What for?

142
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,570
Gholem Qadir.

143
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,742
We caught him.

144
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:08,232
D.O.D. turned Qadir
loose a few years ago.

145
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,129
And who thought that was a good idea?

146
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,930
It's a complicated world, Johnny.

147
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,125
The nerve agent's not the only WMD Qadir's
tried getting his scummy fingers on.

148
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,251
Last month, he tried to buy Malcolm
Merlyn's prototype earthquake machine.

149
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,363
Thank you for stopping that, by the way.

150
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,725
Fortunately, he doesn't know
about your involvement in that.

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,969
He remembers you as the man
who tried to save his life.

152
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,682
The nerve agent's under lock and key
at his estate in Markovia.

153
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,882
He's scheduled to host a
fundraiser there shortly.

154
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,088
The two of us haven't
exactly kept in touch.

155
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,211
We've got that covered,
but our window is rapidly closing.

156
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,761
Okay.

157
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,486
I infiltrate the fundraiser,
come out with the package.

158
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,082
- Sounds simple enough.
- Nothing in this business is simple.

159
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,925
You know that, Mr. Diggle.

160
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,409
Follow me.

161
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,648
I don't need you to get
the nerve agent out.

162
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,410
I need you to get your team in.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,809
My team?

164
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,924
They're designated "Task Force X".

165
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,326
Give me a break.

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,561
This ain't no task force.
Let's call it like it is.

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,967
Welcome to the Suicide Squad.

168
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,449
It's not only prisoners who grow coarse
and hardened from corporal punishment...

169
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,486
but those as well who perpetrate the act
or who are present to witness it.

170
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,241
- Oh, please stop giving him books.
- So this is your unit, huh, Waller?

171
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,886
What, O.J. and Charles Manson
weren't available?

172
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,846
This is a dangerous operation.

173
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,969
And these men have useful skills.

174
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,209
- Should the mission be compromised...
- You'll just write them off.

175
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,166
The Suicide Squad.

176
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,691
Yeah, like he would ever
make the sacrifice.

177
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,363
I can't believe you're
on board with this.

178
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,847
- Those men are murderers.
- And what's the number of...

179
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,800
bodies between Oliver Queen and Sara Lance?

180
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,001
What they do...

181
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,730
What I do is completely different.

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,002
Not really, John. Don't you see that?

183
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,240
What I see is you letting the man
who killed my brother roam completely free.

184
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,209
It's not freedom. It's work.

185
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,324
- It's wrong.
- Do you cuties need some counseling?

186
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,165
I'm a trained therapist.

187
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,767
"Do you have previous
experience in retail?"

188
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,047
Does shopping count?

189
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,009
Sara?

190
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,571
I've seen that look before.

191
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,525
On my face in the mirror,
when Ollie goes into distant mode.

192
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,407
Hang in there.

193
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,126
- He'll open up to you when he's ready.
- Yeah.

194
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,651
You'd think so.

195
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,923
I started by tracing the donation Mr.
Wilson made to Moira's campaign.

196
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,400
All of the money was routed through a series
of offshore accounts, none of which...

197
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,121
link back to a local address. So I
looked into credit card transactions...

198
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,402
and car rental agreements.

199
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,689
He's gotta get around somehow,
just not by rental car.

200
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,247
Slade's former ASIS.
He knows how to be a ghost.

201
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,966
Robbery in progress.

202
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,606
5th and Giffen.

203
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,361
Still in the crime-fighting
business, right?

204
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,964
Harbinger has eyes on the target.

205
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,606
Light the torches.

206
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,963
Deadshot is a go.

207
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,931
Shrapnel is a go.

208
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,321
Tiger is a go.

209
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,363
This is Mockingbird.
Harbinger, you have a green light.

210
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,564
Freelancer, you're a go.

211
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,570
- Deadshot?
- Got Freelancer in my sights.

212
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,167
What's stopping you from shooting me
right now?

213
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,841
Honor.

214
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,288
Can I trouble you for a
cigarette, my friend?

215
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,881
Don't smoke.

216
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,521
And I'm not your friend.

217
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,565
You know who I am?

218
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,480
What it is I do?

219
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,441
You deal in drugs, weapons, and children.

220
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,883
You play both sides of the conflict.

221
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,969
You make money while your country burns.

222
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,490
I do not have to be the only one.

223
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,768
Let me go, I make you rich.

224
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,325
Trying to bribe my men, Qadir?

225
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
If we wanted to make a buck,
this is the last place we'd be, moron.

226
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,770
- Get down.
- Aah!

227
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,371
Heads up!

228
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,525
Oof. I'm sorry, I wasn't
looking where I was...

229
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,930
Gholem Qadir.

230
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,523
I do not know what is less likely...

231
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,480
that John Diggle would be clumsy, or
that I would find him here, of all places.

232
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,761
You like art, my friend?

233
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,930
- I know a good investment when I see one.
- Out of the military, then?

234
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,964
- And in a more lucrative line of work.
- What kind of work is that?

235
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,964
The kind you don't get to ask about.

236
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,725
It was good seeing you, Gholem.

237
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,527
- Everything all right here, Mr. Diggle?
- Yes. He's with me.

238
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
So the soldier now has his own security.

239
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,322
In my line of work, when I do a good job
I tend to make enemies.

240
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,607
A good man turns bad.

241
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,211
Bad man turns good.

242
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,843
- You changed my life, you know.
- Trust that was never my intention.

243
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,089
The intelligence I provided your
government, it saved many lives.

244
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,405
Now, as a free man, I give back when I can.

245
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,045
Of course.

246
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,324
- Get down.
- Aah!

247
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,449
It's all clear.

248
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,130
Déja vu, my friend.

249
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,920
- Mr. Qadir.
- I am fine.

250
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,922
I do not believe I was the target.

251
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,681
Like I said, when I do my job right
I tend to make enemies.

252
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,365
We should go.

253
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,607
Good job, Deadshot. You're a go for exfil.

254
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,405
Already in motion.

255
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,490
Except, uh, I'm not the only one.

256
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,768
Heh, Shrapnel just bolted.

257
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,410
Find him.

258
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,489
Picking him up headed east.

259
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,167
Shrapnel.
Stand down and return to the rally point.

260
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,170
I won't be conscripted into your
immoral army.

261
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,522
Stand down. Final warning.

262
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,480
Especially not while I'm in a country
without an extradition treaty.

263
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,767
Very well.

264
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,530
What the hell is going on?

265
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,449
Shrapnel just fouled out of the game.

266
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,527
What the hell was that?

267
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,324
We're gonna want popcorn for this.

268
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,931
You said it yourself, John...

269
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,123
they're murderers. Criminals.

270
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,695
They need an incentive
to follow orders.

271
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,028
So you rigged their
heads with explosives?

272
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,204
There's no danger as long as they play by
the rules. Scheffer didn't.

273
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,085
It's like I don't even
know you anymore, Lyla.

274
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,409
Where are we at with Qadir?

275
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,565
Save a man's life once...

276
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,202
get a silver star. Save it twice?
Rent a tux.

277
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,042
I'll await further instructions, sir.

278
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,444
So is my patience.

279
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,010
This is Starling City bank account number
for your Mr. Wilson.

280
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,131
To be clear...

281
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,166
take this envelope and we are through.

282
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,681
I do not care who your friends are.

283
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,606
Relax, it's just me.

284
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,725
What's going on, Ollie?

285
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,081
Hey.

286
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,884
- Talk to me.
- Now is not the time.

287
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,929
Then when is the time?

288
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,890
The Bratva, Ollie?

289
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,650
You're losing your grip, okay?

290
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,326
- Slade's getting in your head.
- I need this to stop.

291
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,007
And for it to stop, I need you to find him.

292
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,090
And until then, how long do you think
you can keep this up for?

293
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,127
You're not eating. You're barely sleeping,
and when you do, you have nightmares.

294
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,724
They're about her, aren't they?

295
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,363
Hey, look at me.

296
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,164
You did what you had to do, okay?

297
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,449
Ivo was going to shoot Shado, or me,
or both of us.

298
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,963
- It was an impossible choice.
- I made it anyway.

299
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,207
And if you had chosen differently,
then it would be me haunting you at night.

300
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,329
It still could be, Sara.

301
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,205
That's why we have to stop.

302
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,565
What are you saying?

303
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,323
He's gonna use you to hurt me.

304
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,328
Or he's gonna hurt you.

305
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,364
Stay away from me.

306
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,160
Seeing as you haven't brought it up...

307
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,204
I'm guessing you haven't gotten far
with that H.I.V.E. lead I gave you.

308
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,647
- Just make this quick.
- Heh.

309
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,247
You're usually so chatty, John.

310
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,611
These problems with your girl,
they got you down, huh?

311
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,649
And what about your girl?

312
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,089
The one you have a shrine to in that
cell of yours?

313
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,566
Zoe.

314
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,840
Does your daughter know what
you do for a living?

315
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,564
She is why I do what I do.

316
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,410
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,047
How many enemies can a little girl have?

318
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,924
I wouldn't know.

319
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,966
Everything I make beyond expenses
goes in a blind trust.

320
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,570
A girl needs her father.

321
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,125
No, not this father.

322
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,322
The best thing I can do for her life?

323
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,926
Not be in it.

324
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,124
Is it ready?

325
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,580
You know, we went through
all that trouble to

326
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:33,544
get Johnny here invited
to this little shindig.

327
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,927
Seems like an awful waste not
to use that invitation.

328
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,885
You're using it. Once you have hands
on the nerve agent...

329
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,321
pocket it, walk right on out.

330
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,524
Heh. Copy that.

331
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,329
Thank you very much.
Your generosity is much appreciated.

332
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,447
That's not exactly Army camo.

333
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,327
Have you given any thought to what would
happen if Qadir recognizes you anyway?

334
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,842
Mr. Diggle, who is this vision?

335
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,721
His new bodyguard.

336
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,327
Mm. You will have to refer me
to your security company.

337
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,645
I'm glad you could come tonight. It's the
least I could do after you saved my life.

338
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,166
Again.

339
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,010
I will see you inside, my friend.

340
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,368
Gholem.

341
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,724
It would seem I didn't have time
to get credentials for my associate.

342
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,610
Come. This way.

343
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,124
Gosh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot those were in there.

344
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,442
Enjoy the benefit, Mr. Diggle.

345
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,603
- Deadshot and his gear are in position.
- Tiger's got the overwatch.

346
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,802
Harbinger to all. Fire in the hole.

347
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,440
Shooter at my 10.

348
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,649
- Prepare to bound.
- Got you covered.

349
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,047
- Bounding.
- Go, go, go!

350
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,770
All clear.

351
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,130
He's just a kid.

352
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,204
And don't you look lovely tonight?

353
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,888
I appreciate...

354
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,887
Oh, I think you owe your bodyguard
a dance.

355
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,564
I insist.

356
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,882
Deadshot en route to package.

357
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,405
The fate of the world resting in the hands
of Floyd Lawton.

358
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,648
It helps to focus on the mission.

359
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,285
Is that what you tell yourself?

360
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,681
I tell myself to see the world how it is,
not how I want to see it.

361
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,884
We both operate in the gray.

362
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,401
The only difference is,
I'm willing to admit it.

363
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,190
It's not the only
difference between us.

364
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,146
That's true. I don't
judge other people for it.

365
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,324
- I'm the same man I've always been.
- And I'm who I've always been.

366
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,244
You're rigid, John.

367
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,361
You're blind to any viewpoint
that isn't yours.

368
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,887
These past few months have been amazing.

369
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,043
But we've done more playing than talking.

370
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,601
Because when we talk,
we tend to get divorced.

371
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,202
Don't worry. It's virgin.

372
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,329
Ugh, which is why it tastes terrible.

373
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,280
- Jerk.
- Heh.

374
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,610
So. It looks like things with you
and Sara are going well.

375
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,964
I'm not sure you're the best person
to talk to about all this.

376
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,190
And why is that? Is it because of the
whole cheating, shipwreck, drowning...

377
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,204
not drowning,
you're back, she's back thing? Sorry.

378
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,608
It's brutal AA honesty talking.

379
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,201
I think I preferred it when
we were all lying to each other.

380
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,203
No, you just thought you did.

381
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,647
I know you better than
almost anyone, Ollie.

382
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,407
I know that you think that you don't
deserve to be happy, but you're wrong.

383
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,400
You may think that keeping her at arm's-length
you're protecting her, but you're not.

384
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,570
You're only protecting yourself.

385
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,890
It's more complicated than that.

386
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,042
It always is.

387
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,726
I got the address for that account number
you gave me.

388
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,882
- I'll call Roy and Sara.
- No.

389
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,203
I'm not giving Slade any more targets.

390
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,886
You can't go out there by yourself.
It's suicide.

391
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,048
This started with the two of us.

392
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,491
That's how it ends.

393
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,605
Deadshot's on target.

394
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,928
Heh, bingo.

395
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,764
I don't know what to do.

396
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,201
He's too far ahead.

397
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,970
He's spent years planning this.
He knows everything about me.

398
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,560
I can't.

399
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,921
I don't know how to stop him.

400
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,602
You start by letting people help you.

401
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,649
But he's gonna come after you.

402
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,490
You're alive...

403
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,571
because Shado isn't.

404
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,320
When he does, do you think it'll make
a difference whether or not we're together?

405
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,722
Let him come.

406
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,161
I'm not the girl he knew on the island.

407
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,800
I'm not that easy to kill.

408
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,725
Together.

409
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,570
Together.

410
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,366
I'm in.

411
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,082
I'll have the nerve agent in my pocket
in 30 seconds.

412
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,649
Harbinger...

413
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,289
we've got what I would describe
as a little bit of a situation here.

414
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,881
- Explain.
- I've got eyes on the nerve agent...

415
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,209
and I'm not gonna be able to move it,
much less pocket it.

416
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,686
Standby, Deadshot.

417
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,200
I need to talk to Waller.

418
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,448
- Go for Mockingbird.
- We have a situation.

419
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,286
The package is much bigger than our
pre-op briefing indicated.

420
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,681
Standby.

421
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,127
Deadshot's on target.
I need to see what he does.

422
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,523
Activate the camera in his eyepiece.

423
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,083
Multi-spectrum from Lawton's rig
coming in now.

424
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,170
It's a match.

425
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,282
Tiger, move for extraction.
Deadshot, remain in position.

426
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,370
Harbinger and Freelancer,
evac and head to the rally point.

427
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,440
Deadshot still isn't
topside with the package.

428
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,444
I only needed eyes on.
Fall back to the rally point.

429
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,122
Wait, you knew that the nerve agent
was too large to be extracted?

430
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,211
Fall back to the rally point.

431
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,448
The Nine is inbound and hot.

432
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,043
Mockingbird out.

433
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,727
- What the hell are Nines?
- MQ-9's.

434
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,521
Predators.
Waller's called in a drone strike.

435
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,407
Everyone here is dead inside of 10 minutes.

436
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,390
The Nines carry the Hellfire missile. Just
one of them can level this whole building.

437
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,243
Your boss doesn't care
who's here when it does.

438
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,761
Lyla, we have to get these people
out of here.

439
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,048
Maybe there's a house alarm we can trigger.

440
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,845
John, we have to move now.

441
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,925
I have a better idea.

442
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,967
Excuse me.

443
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,600
Excuse me.

444
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,803
If I could have your attention please.

445
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,641
In honor of our host.

446
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,085
Gholem Qadir excels at
everything he puts his mind to.

447
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,971
Be it business, philanthropy...

448
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,126
or terrorism.

449
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,642
I guess you could say that Gholem
is somewhat of a Renaissance man.

450
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,751
He dabbles in a little
bit of everything.

451
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:29,233
Like arms trading, did I
mention the sex trafficking?

452
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,041
Or the deadly nerve agent that he's holding
just 30 feet beneath this very dance floor?

453
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,046
- These are lies. This man is a mercenary.
- Unh!

454
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,326
Lawton?

455
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,686
He's not answering.

456
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,041
I have to go help him.

457
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,765
Can't believe I just said that.

458
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,122
You. You were in Afghanistan.

459
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,809
Six years ago. You and that Judas were
deceiving me from the start.

460
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,485
- Good timing.
- I got tired of waiting for my invitation.

461
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,043
Disobeying orders, John.

462
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,571
Behind you.

463
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,804
That's two you owe me, junior.

464
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,366
We have to go.

465
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,931
Waller told me to stay here.

466
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,569
- There's an incoming drone strike.
- How contemporary. Get your team clear.

467
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,448
You're on my team. It
is time for you to go.

468
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,802
Yeah, that's right. It is time.

469
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,089
And this is my way to go.

470
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,411
Suicide Squad, remember?

471
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,770
I'm expendable, John.

472
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,487
Even got the damn bomb in my head
to prove it.

473
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,730
This way, at least I get to go out doing
something honorable.

474
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,447
- You don't get to die that easy, Lawton.
- Really?

475
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,406
Why don't you give me even just one
good reason why not, huh?

476
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,124
Zoe.

477
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,767
- What about the nerve gas?
- Believe me...

478
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,883
Waller's already got that covered.

479
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,201
Go. Go. Go.

480
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,970
The drone shifted course.

481
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,811
- It's following us.
- Ha-ha-ha.

482
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,645
- Do you find that funny?
- Waller, what a woman.

483
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,201
How do you think she knew where to
send the drone, huh?

484
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,488
And I mean, the precise coordinates.

485
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,447
- The implants.
- Bomb and GPS.

486
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,161
Pretty clever, right?

487
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,763
The drone ain't targeting Gholem's house.
It's targeting me.

488
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,490
Hang on, do I get a say in this?

489
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,040
- Turn around.
- What are you doing?

490
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,010
- Look, I think I'd rather get blown up.
- Hold still.

491
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,281
This is gonna hurt.

492
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,723
The Markovian government is threatening
retaliation...

493
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,884
following an unprovoked drone attack
over a no-fly zone.

494
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,482
Just the attention we wanted to avoid.
Well done.

495
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,729
- I'm not the one that sent that drone.
- It was cloaked.

496
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,089
An explosion atop a chemical weapons
cache is easy to explain.

497
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,340
Instead, there were
witnesses and we had to

498
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:03,429
send in a SEAL team to
clean out the estate.

499
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,390
I guess you would think twice before dragging
me in to do your dirty work, Waller.

500
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,449
Somehow I don't think it will be an issue.
Good day, Mr. Diggle.

501
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,287
Kind of uncanny.

502
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,768
How Diggle knew exactly where
Lawton's implant was.

503
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,083
Still, it exposed an obvious design flaw.

504
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,004
We'll be putting the implants
in their spinal vertebrae now.

505
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,965
Have Lawton and the others
prepped for surgery.

506
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,644
Waller said in a few years
you might even get a pardon.

507
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,970
Don't worry, John.

508
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,805
We both know
I'm not gonna be around that long.

509
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,721
You still employed?

510
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,964
People with my security clearance
aren't that easy to get rid of.

511
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,571
Right.

512
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,448
What about us, Johnny?

513
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,649
Last night, the man who killed my brother
showed more character...

514
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,571
than the woman charged
with protecting the world.

515
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,682
Good and bad is not so clear to me.

516
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,443
One thing I do know for sure...

517
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,171
black and white...

518
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,650
is that I can never lose you again.

519
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,771
Finally.

520
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,763
Something we agree on.

521
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,525
Well, there goes another...

522
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,529
terrorist-turned-ally.

523
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,963
By the way, I put you in for a commendation
for saving Qadir's ass.

524
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,605
You owe me a beer.

525
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,886
Congratulations.

526
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,202
Yeah, well. "Kill a kid,
get a medal," right?

527
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,525
When someone's shooting
a Kalashnikov at you...

528
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,801
he's not a kid.

529
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,362
I see things differently.

530
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,164
It's a complicated world, Johnny.

531
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,243
Is it okay if I call you Johnny?

532
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,241
I don't think I caught
your first name, Michaels.

533
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,243
Lyla.

534
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,167
It's really good to meet you, Lyla.

535
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,050
In international news,
a United Nations inspections team...

536
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,164
was called to a chemical weapons
manufacturing facility...

537
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,291
hidden beneath the Markovian estate
of humanitarian Gholem Qadir.

538
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,728
Closer to home, mayoral candidate
Moira Queen stumped for...

539
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,766
an initiative to revive inner-city
afterschool swim programs.

540
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,123
I remember how much my children
enjoyed swimming when they were young.

541
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,046
I couldn't get them out of the pool.
Ha-ha-ha!

542
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,281
We need...

543
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,769
- I thought you hated swimming.
- I detest swimming.

544
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,247
So does Thea.

545
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,209
My mother sometimes, ahem, enjoys
a casual relationship with the truth.

546
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,967
Anyway-

547
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,609
Thank you for being there for me.

548
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,326
You mean, for not letting you
push me away?

549
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,483
I'm going to stop doing that.

550
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,808
Yeah. Good.

551
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,801
You'd be wasting your time, anyway.

552
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,608
It looks like you took my advice.

553
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,803
Thank you.

554
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,171
Helping me with Sara, I know that that...

555
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,481
can't be easy.

556
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,490
Helping two people I care about?
There's nothing easier.

557
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,328
I came by to take Sara to dinner.

558
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,161
Would you care to join?

559
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,120
I'd love to, but I need
to go see an old friend.

560
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,481
Okay.

561
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,285
Hello, Oliver.

562
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,529
Hello, Amanda.

563
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,404
- Still mad at me?
- Lucky for you...

564
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,767
- you've been pushed down that list.
- Really?

565
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,962
Who do you wanna kill more than me?

566
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,406
Slade Wilson is alive.

567
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,761
You killed him. It's not possible.

568
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,406
Everything is possible
where Slade is concerned.

569
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,564
And I need your help to find him.

570
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,202
- I might have something.
- What?

571
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,166
There's a new player we've been tracking.
Mercenary.

572
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,251
He's left a trail of bodies from Macao
to Istanbul to Lisbon.

573
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,927
A trail that leads right here to Starling.

574
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,604
We've been calling him Deathstroke.
