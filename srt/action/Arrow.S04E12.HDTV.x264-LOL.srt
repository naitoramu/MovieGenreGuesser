1
00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:02,236
Previously
on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:03,682
You're probably thinking
what happened was your fault.

3
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:06,613
I'm here to tell you
that it's not.

4
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:07,981
It's the fault of
only one man,

5
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:09,249
and we're going to
stop him.

6
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:10,483
Do you remember
what I promised you?

7
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:11,818
A new beginning.

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,653
And you will have it.

9
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:16,322
I've seen what he can do
with his powers,

10
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,458
but when he tried
to use them on me,

11
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,293
it completely backfired

12
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:22,262
and my bloodlust was gone.

13
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:25,265
Help me figure out a way
to make that permanent.

14
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,600
One day I will have
my moment,

15
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:28,835
and I will kill you.

16
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:30,403
Take her.

17
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:02,335
Take that away
as well.

18
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:03,803
The food attracts flies

19
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,139
and I prefer
my solitude.

20
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,807
The pepper came
from the garden.

21
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:11,911
The garden grows strong
even in your absence.

22
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:14,380
Please try a bite.

23
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,096
Quickly. We must--

24
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,373
The mountain
will be ours by morning.

25
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,841
We must act quickly.

26
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,743
The Usurper will return,
and with him, his followers.

27
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,111
Has the Lotus been found?

28
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:20,847
In Kyushu.
It's well guarded.

29
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,084
So was this place
upon a time.

30
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,688
Good news, the burglar
is headed straight towards you.

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,057
Bad news, the burglar
is headed straight towards you.

32
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:39,198
Freeze!

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,466
Where did he
learn to do that?

34
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,135
I'm thinking
Cirque Du Soleil.

35
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,136
He's headed for the roof.

36
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:44,404
Thank you, Black Canary.

37
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,905
That is your cue,
Green Arrow and Speedy.

38
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:46,644
Is she--

39
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,108
Overusing our code names?

40
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:49,609
Yep. Indulge her.

41
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:52,245
We got him, Overwatch.

42
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:53,746
You have no idea
how much I love hearing that.

43
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:55,248
I think we do, actually.

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,916
Two rooftop doors.

45
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:59,185
Floor plans show that
the staircase splits a level below you.

46
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,353
He could come out
either door.

47
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,174
Got him.

48
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:27,914
Speedy!

49
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:46,185

51
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:54,841
How's Thea?

52
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,343
She's ok.
She's resting at our place.

53
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:59,212
She said it was just
exhaustion.

54
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:00,246
We don't believe
a word of that, do we?

55
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:02,315
What else could it be?

56
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,351
The Pit.

57
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:07,453
The bloodlust makes
her feral,

58
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,355
it doesn't make her
lose consciousness.

59
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:10,823
And Thea hasn't gone
aggro in months.

60
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,059
Exactly. Maybe this is
some sort of side effect

61
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,627
of her white-knuckling
her way through it.

62
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,729
It seems like
a bit of a leap.

63
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:19,065
Ollie, what are you
thinking?

64
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,700
That I should have
done a better job

65
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,201
of keeping an eye
on her.

66
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:25,171
She told me the bloodlust came
back two months ago

67
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,372
and I didn't
even know.

68
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:28,608
I've been focused
on the campaign

69
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,112
and I've been running
back and forth to Central City and...

70
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:37,383
How is it that you always manage
to blame yourself for everything?

71
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,719
That's his super power.
Guilt Arrow.

72
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,955
Did our thief steal
anything else from Amertek?

73
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,057
A network mapper.

74
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,092
A piece of tech
designed to scan

75
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:47,660
all nearby digital
infrastructure

76
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,595
for potential
vulnerabilities.

77
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:50,596
Do we think it's
his last score?

78
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,031
We better hope
that it is.

79
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,366
Amertek's one of
the last

80
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:55,001
viable businesses
left in Star City.

81
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,737
Turns out Palmer Tech
is one of those viable businesses.

82
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,605
For now, at least.

83
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:00,773
What do you mean
for now?

84
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,675
The board, in their
infinite wisdom,

85
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,210
decided to move
the presentation

86
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:06,813
on Curtis' world-changing
tech from April to now.

87
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:09,582
And guess who gets to be the face
of that potential disaster?

88
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,018
Oh, well, do you want me
to come with you

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,019
for a little
moral support?

90
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,720
Ahh, no,
I'll be fine.

91
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:16,422
It's just a dry run.

92
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,461
In the past 30 years,

93
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:24,997
battery technology has been
at a virtual standstill

94
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:30,803
with batteries lasting no longer
than they did in the 1970s.

95
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,673
Dammit. Heh.

96
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:36,642
Ahh.

97
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:42,982
Uh, but with Palmer Tech's
power cell, it represents

98
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:45,418
a major breakthrough.

99
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,652
Sorry.

100
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:49,222
Should have gone with
overhead projector.

101
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,991
Mr. Holt.

102
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:53,926
Could you give us
the room, please?

103
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,628
Well, actually,
that's gonna be a little difficult,

104
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,498
seeing how the entire building's
the property of--

105
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,668
I'll just--
I'll be right outside.

106
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,441
Felicity.
Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:10,910
May I be
uncomfortably honest?

108
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,614
Well, you have never shown
an inability to do so before.

109
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,415
Right.

110
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,685
This company has been
flirting with bankruptcy

111
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,554
since before you
returned to Star City.

112
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:26,225
And your injury, well,
it didn't exactly help our stock price.

113
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:29,128
We staked the future
of Palmer Tech on this power cell.

114
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,364
We need to put
our best foot forward.

115
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:34,500
That is not something
that I'm exactly able to do right now.

116
00:06:34,502 --> 00:06:37,837
Sorry, poor choice
of words.

117
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,206
What I mean is perhaps
it would be better

118
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,309
to let someone else
do this presentation.

119
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,145
And by "someone else,"

120
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:48,147
you mean someone
not in a wheelchair.

121
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,783
This is about doing
what's best for the company.

122
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,818
Anything less than
a perfect launch

123
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,354
and we are sunk.

124
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:01,427
Right. You're right.

125
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,396
Please let the board know.

126
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,572
Hey.

127
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:19,845
Just wanted
to check in,

128
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:21,180
see how you were doing.

129
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,481
Well, I think
the answer to that question

130
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,483
is fairly
self-evident.

131
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,520
Thea's bloodlust
is the balancing of an equation.

132
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,689
She was given life
and now she needs to take it.

133
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,957
Malcolm, we know that
already.

134
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,958
What we don't know is--

135
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,993
What you don't know,

136
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,762
what I didn't know
until Thea collapsed

137
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:39,065
is that if the life
she owes

138
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,399
doesn't come
from taking others,

139
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:43,069
it will come
from the life of the host.

140
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,472
Please do not refer to me
as the host.

141
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,907
This isn't a joke.

142
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,575
If you don't indulge
this bloodlust,

143
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:50,710
you will die.

144
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,944
I don't understand.

145
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:53,112
Sara wasn't like this.

146
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,514
John Constantine
made Sara whole

147
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,583
and restored
the balance.

148
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:02,021
Thea, I thought
you were doing ok.

149
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,890
Because the bloodlust was
temporarily blunted.

150
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:05,992
By what?

151
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:07,793
Damien Darhk.

152
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,730
When we rescued Andy
from HIVE,

153
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:14,133
I ran into him.

154
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:17,103
He tried to kill me with his
magic death touch thingie,

155
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,272
but it didn't work on me.

156
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,841
What it did do
was stop the bloodlust

157
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:23,042
for a time.

158
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,543
We need to find
Damien Darhk

159
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,279
and make whatever
he did to her permanent.

160
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,813
Oliver, even if that
were possible,

161
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:30,816
even if you caught Damien
in a more cooperative mood,

162
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:32,818
he and his HIVE have
gone to ground.

163
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,654
Or haven't you noticed?

164
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:37,723
Yeah.

165
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,726
Our sticky-fingered friend just pulled
another job at Cadmus Tech.

166
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,794
He's two blocks
east of you, headed south.

167
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:43,596
John, I can't right now.

168
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:45,097
He stole a weapon
this time.

169
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:46,332
Just go.

170
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,402
Nothing's gonna change
here in an hour.

171
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:53,005
I'm on my way.

172
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:54,073
Where am I looking?

173
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,374
We're working
on it.

174
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:58,577
Got him!

175
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:57,536
Roy?

176
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,518
First Sara, then Ray,
then John's brother.

177
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:13,621
Whose shocking return
can we look forward to next?

178
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:15,489
Oliver, I'm gonna ask this
just to ask it.

179
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,956
Are you sure
that it was--

180
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,425
It was Roy.
Absolutely.

181
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,313
Or maybe it was just
somebody who's able

182
00:10:21,314 --> 00:10:22,813
to make themselves
look like Roy.

183
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,849
Don't act like it's
the craziest possibility

184
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,652
after everything
that we've experienced.

185
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:30,254
What's crazy is Roy
stealing from tech companies.

186
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,956
What did he take
this time?

187
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,257
A triode capacitor bomb.

188
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,927
Tiny device,
really huge boom.

189
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:40,431
This is Alex
for the 500th time today.

190
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,771
Hey.

191
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,307
Hey, I was just
texting you.

192
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,575
How did you--

193
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:53,110
Oh, campaign office
has a secret elevator.

194
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,111
What?

195
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,580
I'm kidding.

196
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:57,148
I came in the side
to avoid the media.

197
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,749
Got your 911.
Everything all right?

198
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:00,117
No, not really.

199
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,152
"Ledger's" going to
press with it tomorrow,

200
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:02,553
but we got a heads up.

201
00:11:02,555 --> 00:11:03,788
Someone else is throwing
their hat in the ring.

202
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,022
Who?

203
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:07,024
Political novice
it looks like.

204
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,226
I'm still working up a bio, but she seems
to have come out of nowhere

205
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:12,363
to suddenly have
a campaign office in Pennytown.

206
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,298
Ruvé Adams.

207
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:20,705
Do you know her
from somewhere?

208
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:24,609
No. I'm just surprised
to have an opponent.

209
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:27,645
Yeah, it's pretty much
a game changer.

210
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,146
Sorry.

211
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:32,216
Yes, it is.

212
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,521
Aah! Aah!

213
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:40,091
I've never doubted
you resiliency, Mr. Queen,

214
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,959
but you will
tell me.

215
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,094
Aah!

216
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:45,196
Why did you need
these maps?

217
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,400
Aah!

218
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:51,102
He can't tell you
anything if you kill him.

219
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:53,804
Get her out of here.

220
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:56,307
No!

221
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,615
What did your
tattoos reveal, huh?

222
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:07,918
What were you trying
to find?

223
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,838
Hello, Oliver.

224
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:31,175
It's good to see you
again.

225
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,353
Are you here
to endorse me?

226
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:44,121
I want a meeting
with your husband.

227
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,823
I'm not sure you
would survive

228
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:47,925
another meeting
with my husband.

229
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,527
No fight this time.

230
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,396
I have a proposition
for him.

231
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:53,431
I'm listening.

232
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:58,302
Tomorrow, 10:30.
Kershaw and 8th.

233
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,239
Uh, we have
a new problem.

234
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,075
I was going over
the schematics

235
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:05,676
of the two pieces
of stolen tech,

236
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,578
trying to figure out
where Roy was going to hit next.

237
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,913
Any luck?

238
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,414
No. I mean,
not at first.

239
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,249
A capacitor bomb
and a network mapper,

240
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,585
that's like a ceiling fan
and broccoli.

241
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:15,753
Sounds like
a messy combination.

242
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,221
Combination being
the breakthrough.

243
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:18,522
I stopped trying
to figure out

244
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:20,424
what the two pieces
of tech had in common

245
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,727
and started working on what would
happen if they were combined somehow,

246
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,295
the components,
specifically.

247
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:25,629
Tell us something good.

248
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,832
Depends on your
definition of "good."

249
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,534
But I'm pretty sure that Amertek's
network mapper and Cadmus' capacitor

250
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:33,237
could theoretically
be used to create a web-nuke.

251
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,605
Like a bomb?

252
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,107
Roy already stole
a bomb.

253
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:37,908
No, I'm talking about
a device that can destroy

254
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,976
the entire Internet.

255
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:40,311
We're talking
banking systems,

256
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,546
nuclear arsenals,
power grids.

257
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:45,116
Last year Roy could
barely spell "computer."

258
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:47,151
Even assuming he did
build this device--

259
00:13:47,153 --> 00:13:48,619
why hasn't he used it?

260
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,287
Because it's incomplete.
A device like this

261
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,124
needs a really substantial
power source to run off of.

262
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:55,392
And guess what company
in Star City

263
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:58,763
just invented a next generation
revolutionary battery.

264
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,770
I don't want
to hurt you.

265
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:07,271
I don't want you
to hurt me, either.

266
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:08,606
Well, I'm going to
need to take that.

267
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:11,575
Oh, I think you might
have to hurt me, then.

268
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:47,511
Roy.

269
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:49,947
Stand down.

270
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:51,315
There's something
wrong with him.

271
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,317
Yeah, I think that's
been established.

272
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,718
Let's talk
about this, Roy.

273
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,821
I'm in position.

274
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:57,888
Roy.

275
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,591
Roy, what are you doing?

276
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:01,959
Listen very carefully.

277
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,229
Are you sure?

278
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,564
Do it.

279
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:12,336
No, wait.

280
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:13,871
What did you do?

281
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:32,859
Take out the tranq,
carefully.

282
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:35,461
Let's hope the Faraday
cage Cisco installed in here works.

283
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,696
What?

284
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:37,997
Basically a shield

285
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,632
for everything broadcast
and electromagnetic.

286
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,267
Which eye did you
see the tech in?

287
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:42,769
The right one.

288
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:46,773
How'd you even know
he had it?

289
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:48,241
Roy's eyes are blue.

290
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:50,276
I'm guessing this was
transmitting an AV signal,

291
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:51,577
probably to whoever
was picking up the tech.

292
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:53,579
Well, he can tell us
when he wakes up.

293
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:00,571
Wh--where am I?

294
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:01,704
It's ok.

295
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:02,839
We took out
the contact.

296
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,440
We made it look like
we killed you.

297
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,508
You're safe.

298
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,443
While I'm in here,
at least.

299
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,246
New lair. Nice.

300
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:15,718
I heard about
what happened.

301
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,853
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,224
Roy, what happened
to you.

303
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,692
I got made.

304
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:25,928
I was in Hub City,
new name, new life, everything,

305
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,230
and then I got an email.

306
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:28,231
Saying what?

307
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,365
Steal a bunch of stuff?

308
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,234
Or he'll expose me
as Roy Harper.

309
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:33,202
Suddenly the Arrow's
not dead anymore

310
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,571
and then the police, they'd
be looking at you again.

311
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:36,906
Who's
the blackmailer?

312
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,541
I don't know.
I've never met him.

313
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,576
But he calls himself
the Calculator.

314
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,046
This is what happens when
the bad guys name themselves.

315
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:44,756
Roy, you should have
come to us sooner.

316
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:45,504
I couldn't.

317
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:46,383
He's right.

318
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:47,717
There's a camera
built into this.

319
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,085
This is really
incredible tech.

320
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,653
He could see every single
move I made,

321
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:51,988
every person I talked to.

322
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,723
I couldn't just
expose you guys like that.

323
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:54,791
We would have figured
something out.

324
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:55,992
This is my problem.

325
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:57,326
'Cause you were
solving my problem.

326
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:00,263
Ok, well, our problem
is that the Calculator

327
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:02,265
now has everything he needs
to melt the Internet.

328
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,067
I love the Internet.

329
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,935
Which means we have to
find him, fast.

330
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:07,570
Can you backtrace
the components,

331
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:08,671
figure out where
they're broadcast to?

332
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:09,972
Girl, you read my mind.

333
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:11,507
Pop your jacket off,
I'll patch you up.

334
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:13,609
Man, I cannot believe
you shot me.

335
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:15,344
Really?

336
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,886
Mei?

337
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,555
Shado.

338
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:28,524
Shado's dead.

339
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:29,692
I know.

340
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:31,227
You're having a vision.

341
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:33,262
The result of your injuries.

342
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:39,635
You're not real.

343
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,705
No.

344
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,874
But what I've come
to tell you is.

345
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,112
What have you come
to tell me?

346
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:52,115
You need to forgive
yourself for what you've done.

347
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:57,453
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to be
a little more specific.

348
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,989
You had the chance
to leave this island,

349
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,524
to return to
your family.

350
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,192
They miss you
terribly.

351
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:06,329
I can't go back
to my family.

352
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,365
Not the way
that I am now.

353
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,536
Then it's time
to start changing.

354
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:18,341
The only way out
is through, Oliver.

355
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:22,345
That's what
Amanda Waller said.

356
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:24,180
Through what?

357
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:26,849
Through your
own darkness.

358
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:28,985
Let it go.

359
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,290
I don't know how.

360
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,894
Then I will
teach you.

361
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:46,369
This is it.

362
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:47,837
I see no shrine.

363
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,572
The woods are
the shrine, Talibah.

364
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,941
In times long past,
the people of Japan

365
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:53,543
found their Gods
in all things.

366
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:57,113
Nature was their temple.

367
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,225
I must do this alone.

368
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:10,693
If I do not return
within the hour,

369
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:14,130
tell the others
the war is over.

370
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:38,487
Hello, Tatsu.

371
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,623
You look well.

372
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,126
Being a member of
the Crescent Order clearly suits you.

373
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,331
I have found my purpose.

374
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,533
What is yours in Japan?

375
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:55,771
I've come for the Lotus.

376
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:59,642
It is my responsibility
to keep it safe.

377
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:01,544
I know.

378
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:04,247
Unfortunate.

379
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,677
We're evenly matched.

380
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,714
One of us must yield
or this will go on for ages.

381
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:40,750
I have nowhere else
to be.

382
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:42,451
I do.

383
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:44,854
On a matter that
concerns Oliver Queen.

384
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:48,457
I see two options.

385
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,427
We keep fighting until
one of us drops from exhaustion

386
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,563
or we lay down our swords

387
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:57,300
and you listen to
what I have to say.

388
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:02,305
Maybe next time
we can do something

389
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:03,906
that doesn't involve
me getting stabbed or shot at.

390
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:07,043
Just an idea.

391
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:09,011
I'm sorry that I put you
in this position.

392
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm pretty sure
I put myself in this position.

393
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:13,683
I remember you not
being all that happy

394
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:14,917
that I fakes my
death to protect your secret.

395
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,819
I never should have
let you.

396
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:18,788
Do you ever get
tired, you know,

397
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,222
of carrying the weight of the world
on your shoulders

398
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:21,557
like that all
the time?

399
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,892
You sound like Felicity.

400
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:24,360
And Diggle.

401
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:25,928
Well, great minds.

402
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,230
So what are Felicity
and John saying

403
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:30,399
you're taking
responsibility for now?

404
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:36,906
Thea.

405
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:38,541
Oh, my God.

406
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:41,243
Am I hallucinating?

407
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:45,214
It's really you.

408
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,451
How are you?

409
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:50,119
I've been better.
Um...

410
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:52,421
How are you?

411
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:55,391
Where have you been?

412
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:57,994
What are you doing here?

413
00:21:57,996 --> 00:22:00,062
How--how long are you--

414
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,297
Here--

415
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,265
Thea?

416
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:06,469
Thea!

417
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:08,037
What's happening?

418
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,605
I don't...

419
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:11,674
I don't know.

420
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:15,111
Oh, my God.

421
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:16,145
It's the wound
from Ra's.

422
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:17,246
I'll call 911.

423
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,481
No, doctors
can't help her.

424
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,384
Stay with us, Thea.
Stay strong.

425
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:23,986
Give it a minute,
it will pass.

426
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,931
You're ok.

427
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,804
How's it going?

428
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:44,340
This tiny piece
of plastic

429
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:46,542
has more computing power in it
than most high-end laptops.

430
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:48,844
I have half a mind to
reverse engineer it for Palmer Tech.

431
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:50,079
But first?

432
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:53,749
Yes, I found a tiny flaw
in the OS code.

433
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,584
I'm pretty sure I can
exploit it

434
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:58,220
to open a back door
to his main computer system.

435
00:22:58,222 --> 00:23:01,223
Right, but wouldn't that risk
exposing us?

436
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:04,226
My pride that you
understood what I was saying

437
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,629
is slightly uncut
by your lack of faith in me.

438
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:09,432
I've nothing but faith,
just do it.

439
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:12,168
I already did.

440
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,937
Well, well.
Whoever you are,

441
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,606
let me just say
I am very impressed.

442
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,843
No one's ever been able to break
through my encryption before.

443
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:22,211
Bravo.

444
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:24,447
Disguise your voice.

445
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:26,982
Thanks.

446
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:28,651
I would take that
as a compliment

447
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:30,653
if it wasn't coming
from some nutjob

448
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,254
who's trying to
destroy the Internet.

449
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,490
Why would I want to
take down the net?

450
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:36,358
Not only is it
where I work,

451
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,994
I'm addicted to
funny cat videos.

452
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:41,363
Well, if you're not trying to
take down the Internet,

453
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:42,998
what do you need
a web-nuke for?

454
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,501
Very clever
keeping me talking

455
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:48,137
to buy you time to
breach my firewall.

456
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,474
So that's a pass
on telling me your evil plan?

457
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:53,642
Let's put it this way,

458
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,611
if you want to make
a statement,

459
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:57,746
you don't take down
a system,

460
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:00,716
you take down a city.

461
00:24:03,855 --> 00:24:05,855
Dammit!
He shut me out.

462
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:08,190
Not before indicating what
his plan might be.

463
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:12,828
How do you take down
a Ci...

464
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,498
Oh, no.

465
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,700
What?

466
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:19,502
I've been thinking
about what would happen

467
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:21,770
if he used the web-nuke
to take down the Internet,

468
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:24,240
but if he used it right,

469
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,075
overloading
the electrical grid,

470
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:27,409
shutting down
hospital equipment,

471
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,411
causing water main breaks.

472
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:33,349
He..He could kill
everyone in the city.

473
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:44,102
So a web-nuke needs
to be deployed somewhere.

474
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:46,602
We need to know where
the Calculator wants to install it.

475
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:48,604
I am not calling him that
on principle,

476
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:50,306
'cause it is
a lame codename.

477
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:52,274
Ok, Felicity, but we still
have to check--

478
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,176
I'm conducting a review
of all the nodes, sub-nodes,

479
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:56,312
and network access points
where the web-nuke

480
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,380
would do the most damage.

481
00:24:58,382 --> 00:24:59,615
Any luck?

482
00:24:59,617 --> 00:25:01,217
Why do you always
ask me that?

483
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:02,985
If I had any luck
looking for what I'm looking for,

484
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:05,268
I would be telling you
about it instead of looking for it.

485
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:09,291
Sorry. Stressed.

486
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:11,761
In addition to
our lunatic of the week,

487
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:14,029
I have Palmer Tech
to look after.

488
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:15,631
Palmer Tech.

489
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:18,434
Ray worked up something
last year called a battering ram,

490
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:20,269
basically something that could crash
through cyber security.

491
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,004
No commercial application,
but--

492
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,473
Can you use it to get back
into the Calculator's system?

493
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:26,876
Stop calling him that,
I'm serious.

494
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:35,151
Your darkness
is guilt.

495
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,887
You've taken
many lives.

496
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:42,992
The life of your love's
brother most recently.

497
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:45,828
I'm not in love with
Taiana.

498
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,864
She helped you recover
the maps from the Amazo.

499
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:51,033
She nursed you
back to health.

500
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:56,372
And all she's received
from you in return is a lie.

501
00:26:02,113 --> 00:26:03,312
Open your eyes.

502
00:26:06,284 --> 00:26:08,784
What's this?

503
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:14,657
Curtis Holt, have you
seen the battering ram?

504
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,527
It's this kick ass piece of tech that
ray invented last year.

505
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:20,796
Um, cyndrical shape,
titanium shell.

506
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:22,832
I'm gearing up for
a brute force attack.

507
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,099
Look out for that--

508
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:25,868
And I need all the
firepower I can muster.

509
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,703
Stool.
Uh, never mind.

510
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:29,538
Hey, you've gotten
pretty slick on that thing

511
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,640
in the last 24 hours.
What happened?

512
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:34,143
Yes! I got it.

513
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:36,645
Thanks, Curtis.
You're the best.

514
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,080
I didn't do anything.

515
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:39,281
You're the one who's
whipping around here

516
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,916
like a house on fire.

517
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:43,118
Well, that is what happens
when the entire city is at stake.

518
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,456
But now when it's just,
say, an entire company.

519
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:51,293
Mr. Dennis says you're no longer
presenting the power cell to the board.

520
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:53,629
Well, my dry run
was an epic disaster.

521
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:54,930
Yeah, I know.

522
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:56,465
It was...It was
a spectacular failure.

523
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,968
Like, it was really bad.
Ok.

524
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,237
But it wouldn't have
been if this Felicity had come in.

525
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,239
You know, the one
who wheels in here

526
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,541
kicking ass and taking names
like you just did.

527
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:06,942
This is different.

528
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:09,578
No, it's not.

529
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,614
There's two Felicitys,
Felicity.

530
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:13,849
The one in
that boardroom

531
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,151
whose wheelchair makes
her doubt herself

532
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:19,288
and this Felicity,

533
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,756
a brilliant force
of nature.

534
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:25,294
This company needs
the second Felicity.

535
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:29,598
Hey.

536
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,469
Laurel told me.

537
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:36,338
You ok?

538
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,140
I'm feeling a bit better.

539
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:41,543
Hey. I'm working on
something.

540
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:43,879
If it's a pedophile
for me to kill,

541
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:47,349
Malcolm's already been
pitching that one hard.

542
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:48,884
You're not a killer,
Thea.

543
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:51,587
That's not a way
for you to live.

544
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:54,823
But it sounds like
Damien Darhk might be.

545
00:27:54,825 --> 00:28:00,062
Yeah, I'm sure he's
just itching to do us a favor.

546
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:01,297
We're gonna find out.

547
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:02,965
I arranged a meeting.

548
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:07,903
It's not like he's
gonna be willing to help me.

549
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:10,139
Maybe there's something
that he wants,

550
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:12,007
something I can
trade him.

551
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:13,876
Ollie, that's insane.

552
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:16,912
Not to mention stupid.
I...

553
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:20,349
I can't let you owe
Darhk a favor.

554
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,584
And I can't let
you die.

555
00:28:24,355 --> 00:28:26,255
I won't.

556
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:30,092
That's not up to you.

557
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:33,362
Look, I know how you
take everything on,

558
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:35,531
everyone's problems.

559
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:38,000
It's one of the things
I love the most about you.

560
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:41,870
But you can't fix
this one, Ollie.

561
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:44,406
I have to try.

562
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:46,976
No, you don't.

563
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:49,111
It's my choice.

564
00:28:50,381 --> 00:28:52,681
It's my life.

565
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:01,256
She's stubborn,
isn't she?

566
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:04,393
Definitely something
she gets from your side of the family.

567
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:05,694
It doesn't matter.

568
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,896
Because you're going to
go hood in hand

569
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:10,632
to Damien Darhk.

570
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:14,069
I am the Demon's Head.
I have my resources.

571
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:16,638
And I know how to put my
ear up against a door.

572
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:22,644
Leaving the epic
stupidity of your plan aside,

573
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:24,446
Thea's right.

574
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:26,715
This is neither
of our decisions.

575
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:30,486
Malcolm, do you want
her to die?

576
00:29:30,488 --> 00:29:32,388
Of course not.

577
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,989
Do you have any idea
how badly

578
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,324
I want to put a knife
in her hand

579
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,359
and force her to slit
someone's throat?

580
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:40,863
I've come this close to dragging
someone in here for her to kill.

581
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:44,967
And the reason I don't is because
that would be about my feelings

582
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,069
and not Thea's.

583
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:51,006
Oliver, sometimes
the greatest act of love

584
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:52,775
is no action at all.

585
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:58,280
It's her life.
It's her choice.

586
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:00,349
This almost feels
like cheating,

587
00:30:00,351 --> 00:30:02,618
using Ray's tech
to beat this guy.

588
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,186
Got it.

589
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:05,888
He's installing the web-nuke
at Flint Hill Data Farm.

590
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,989
Installing?

591
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:08,023
Yeah, he's doing it
right now.

592
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:09,158
Get Oliver.

593
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,543
Device is onsite.

594
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:51,977
Dandy.

595
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,052
Hang on a second.

596
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:00,787
Miss me?

597
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:22,676
I have seriously
missed this.

598
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:23,877
Overwatch,
we're on station.

599
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,278
I'm trying to find
the web-nuke,

600
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,613
but our adversary
knows I'm in his system

601
00:31:26,615 --> 00:31:27,881
and he's trying to
kick me out.

602
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:29,449
I did get a look
at his protocols, though.

603
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:30,851
And if the web-nuke
goes online,

604
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:32,219
he could kill 8,000 people.

605
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:34,387
I'd say that's
a conservative estimate.

606
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:36,957
Blowing the gas mains
alone would kill 3,000.

607
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,359
Just wait till you see what I've
got planned for the subway cars.

608
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:42,129
Ooh, good story. Write me a letter.
From prison.

609
00:31:42,131 --> 00:31:43,864
The battering ram
was a neat trick,

610
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:45,398
but the only way
you're going to stop me

611
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,467
is by removing the
web-nuke on site.

612
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:49,603
And I suspect that
you don't come out

613
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,204
from behind that
keyboard much.

614
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,240
That's what I have
friends for.

615
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,414
Ok, so does anyone know how
to disconnect this thing?

616
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:04,551
I brought friends, too.

617
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:06,019
Hired mercenaries.

618
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:08,455
It's amazing who you can
find on the dark web.

619
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:23,236
Always got to
make an entrance, don't you?

620
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:25,572
Sorry, there was
a meeting that I decided not to go to.

621
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:28,542
Look, I know it's
been a while for me,

622
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:30,210
but this still isn't
a good thing, right?

623
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:32,345
You know, I almost feel
bad about beating you.

624
00:32:32,347 --> 00:32:35,882
Rarely do I get to meet someone
with your talents.

625
00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:42,088
What did you do?

626
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,991
Boom! I believe
the technical term is I pwned you.

627
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:47,527
Be that as it may,
I can breach your firewall

628
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:51,064
faster than I can remove
the DRMs off a Beatles tune.

629
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,033
Guys, the web-nuke
is hard wired in.

630
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:54,634
Not to get too
inside baseball on you,

631
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:55,902
but I need you to
blow the thing up.

632
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:56,903
How much time
do we have?

633
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:58,371
Um, it's a long
story,

634
00:32:58,373 --> 00:32:59,330
but somewhere between "I Want
To Hold Your Hand"

635
00:32:59,331 --> 00:32:59,984
and "Hey, Jude."

636
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,575
Priming the explosive.

637
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,176
Something's not working.

638
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:05,312
He's jamming
the detonation frequencies.

639
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:06,513
Ok, do this
the old-fashioned way

640
00:33:06,515 --> 00:33:07,614
and manually set the charge.

641
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:08,815
Yeah, but how do
we do that

642
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:09,849
and get out of here
in one piece?

643
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:11,017
Someone has to stay behind.

644
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,619
I'll do it.

645
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,788
Even if you triggered
the C4 with an arrow at a distance,

646
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,590
you still need to outrun
the blast radius.

647
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:18,525
I can do that.

648
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:20,560
Just because you're wearing red
doesn't make you the Flash, Roy.

649
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:21,661
I didn't say it
wasn't gonna be risky.

650
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:23,630
You just got a fresh start.

651
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:25,465
I don't want you
to throw it all away.

652
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:27,467
I'm the one who
brought this maniac into your lives.

653
00:33:27,469 --> 00:33:29,869
I need to do this.
This is my choice.

654
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:33,206
It's my life.

655
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,507
Ok.

656
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,178
See you outside,
kid.

657
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,513
Good luck.

658
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:46,853
Hey, you run like hell.

659
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,623
Yeah.

660
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:54,761
You guys might want
to get out of here.

661
00:34:01,303 --> 00:34:02,869
Come on, Roy.

662
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:04,304
Come on!

663
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:36,903
Ooh.

664
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,774
Just like riding
a bicycle.

665
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,590
It's good to have
you back, Roy.

666
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:50,978
You've been missed.

667
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,846
Well, don't get
too used to me.

668
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:54,881
I'm gonna have to go
underground again.

669
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:57,217
Even deeper now that
the Calculator knows who I am.

670
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:59,286
What's to keep him
from posting it on the Internet?

671
00:34:59,288 --> 00:35:01,455
Oh, I might have installed
a virus in his system

672
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:03,323
that wiped out everything
he had on Roy.

673
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:05,225
I'm sorry I can't stay.

674
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:08,628
Not just for you guys,
but for Thea.

675
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,896
She'll understand.

676
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:11,631
She's gonna be ok,
Oliver.

677
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:15,736
Well, whatever
she decides,

678
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,871
I'm gonna back
her play.

679
00:35:31,553 --> 00:35:33,120
Thank God.

680
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,188
I thought the fever
would never break.

681
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,289
I'll get you
some water.

682
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,424
Taiana.

683
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:41,661
I need to tell you
something.

684
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:43,363
It's ok.

685
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:44,698
Whatever it is,
it can wait

686
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,732
until you've had
some water.

687
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:47,601
I lied to you.

688
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:53,907
When I said that Conklin
killed your brother,

689
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:55,742
that was a lie.

690
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:57,677
I don't understand.

691
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,580
I have this darkness
inside of me

692
00:36:00,582 --> 00:36:04,384
that I've been trying
to escape for the longest time.

693
00:36:04,386 --> 00:36:06,386
And I think that
I found a way,

694
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:09,423
but first I need
to earn your forgiveness.

695
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:10,791
For what?

696
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,494
I didn't know that
Vlad was your brother.

697
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:20,500
There are reasons,
but they don't matter,

698
00:36:20,502 --> 00:36:22,335
they don't change
what I did.

699
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:26,440
I killed your brother.

700
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:28,375
No.

701
00:36:46,428 --> 00:36:48,495
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

702
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:52,232
You are gonna be great.
Break a leg.

703
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,433
Sorry.

704
00:36:53,435 --> 00:36:56,269
Ok.

705
00:36:58,974 --> 00:37:02,042
Welcome.

706
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:06,546
This is a day I have looked forward to
for a very long time.

707
00:37:06,548 --> 00:37:10,182
Because today I stand

708
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:14,199
on the shoulders of many giants.

709
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:18,391
Nikola Tesla,
Thomas Edison, Ray Palmer,

710
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:22,996
and of course, Curtis Holt.

711
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:26,299
Their work has always been
about making this world a better place.

712
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:31,771
And today, we get to take
another step towards that goal.

713
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:35,242
As you know, battery technology
has been at a virtual standstill

714
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:38,445
for decades, with batteries lasting,
nor charging any faster

715
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,413
than they did in the 1970s.

716
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:44,718
Until now.

717
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,488
Today Palmer Tech is
pleased to introduce

718
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,626
the Power Cell, a 100%
recyclable battery.

719
00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:55,896
It can charge an electric car
for thousands of miles.

720
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,732
And right now, it is
single-handedly

721
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,935
not only powering
this entire presentation,

722
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:05,539
but this entire building.

723
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:18,451
She is something
else, isn't she?

724
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:21,154
You have no idea.

725
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:29,062
You know, you should be
a nurse in your new life.

726
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:32,432
You're a natural at it.

727
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:37,003
The only problem is,
I am a one-patient man,

728
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,172
and I'm already
committed to you.

729
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:41,508
Is that why
you're leaving?

730
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,545
Look, I get it, Star City is filled
with too many people

731
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:46,947
who can
recognize you.

732
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,585
You know, I thought
about staying anyway.

733
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:55,355
For you.

734
00:38:55,357 --> 00:38:58,024
You know what
you could do for me?

735
00:38:58,026 --> 00:39:02,729
Go live
an amazing life.

736
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:07,601
Get married, have
a couple of kids.

737
00:39:09,338 --> 00:39:12,005
Get a minivan.

738
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:17,410
Just go be normal.

739
00:39:17,412 --> 00:39:19,479
There's nothing
in this world

740
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,848
that would make me
happier than that.

741
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:28,555
You know, if I could do
all of this over again,

742
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:32,158
I would do every single one
of those things with you.

743
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,061
Me, too.

744
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:39,466
I love you, Thea Queen.

745
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:43,236
I love you,
Roy Harper.

746
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,748
You were amazing
out there.

747
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,850
Heh. Thanks.

748
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,285
How's Thea doing?

749
00:39:58,287 --> 00:39:59,552
I'm gonna go check
on her now.

750
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:00,887
I'm just gonna debrief
with Curtis,

751
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:02,322
but text me
how she's doing.

752
00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:03,857
Ok.

753
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:18,071
Oh, my God.

754
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:19,406
Dad?

755
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:27,573
How is she?

756
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:28,916
Resting.

757
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,617
Where's your
new BFF Damien?

758
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:31,885
I don't know.

759
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,154
Like you said, this
is Thea's decision,

760
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:35,689
it's not mine.

761
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:36,823
Oliver,
I know it feels wrong,

762
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,558
but you did
the right thing.

763
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,762
However it feels,
I couldn't have done it without you.

764
00:40:42,764 --> 00:40:44,331
Malcolm, thank you.

765
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,199
For everything.

766
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:51,504
Oliver, it's Thea.

767
00:40:57,946 --> 00:41:00,113
How long will she
be in a coma?

768
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:05,185
Right now she's barely
a 3 on the Glasgow Scale.

769
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:07,654
Prognosis isn't good.

770
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:09,656
I'm sorry.

771
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:24,704
Thea, please don't go.

772
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:32,412
There's only one way
to prevent that.

773
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:35,349
My father once told me
of an elixir known as Lotus,

774
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,551
capable of countering
the effects of the Lazarus Pit.

775
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,854
A secret weapon developed by the
League's enemies.

776
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,355
Do you have it?

777
00:41:42,357 --> 00:41:43,857
I do.

778
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,218
And I will freely give it to you
on one condition.

779
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,394
I want you to kill
Malcolm Merlyn.

780
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:59,740
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

781
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,333
Greg!
Move your head.
