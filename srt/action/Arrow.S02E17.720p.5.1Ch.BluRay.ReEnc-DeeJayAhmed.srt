1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,845
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,843
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,089
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,568
To save my city.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,929
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,171
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,961
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,960
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,929
This is my daughter, Helena.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,801
When her father killed her fiance, she
changed into something dark and twisted.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,760
My father doesn't deserve a second chance,
a second life.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,129
This is about learning
to control your strength.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,651
Ollie, it's over!
We gotta get off this ship!

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,401
Hugo Mannheim.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,086
Warrants out for racketeering,
extortion, murder.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,810
The goombah trifecta.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,321
But he never travels alone,
so watch your back...

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,960
watch your partner's back. Let's go.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,887
Thanks for helping me
keep watch over my dad tonight.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,964
As long as Slade's out there,
neither of our families are safe.

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,569
This is the S.C.P.D.
Put your weapons on the ground!

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,529
Move, move, move!

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,364
Move, move, move!

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,091
Freeze!

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,251
I'm fine. Go.

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,005
Go!

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,769
- Frank Bertinelli.
- Did my daughter send you to kill me?

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,202
- Hey.
- Dad, are you all right? Are you hurt?

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,805
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,770
Listen, I know you don't exactly believe
in reading perps their Mirandas...

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,316
but you can't just
toss a guy out a window.

32
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,341
He shot you.

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,686
I'm still here, ain't I?

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,922
Just next time, show a little restraint.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,764
That was me showing restraint.

36
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,605
- Detective, we have another problem.
- Yeah, I know.

37
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,561
With Frank Bertinelli in custody, it's just a
matter of time before she rolls back in town.

38
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,085
Who's she?

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,045
Helena Bertinelli.
Daughter of Mafia boss, Frank Bertinelli.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,723
Or as I call her, Oliver's psycho ex-girlfriend
hell-bent on revenge against her father.

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,645
- Ex-girlfriend?
- That's what you took from that sentence?

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,167
Why does she want her father
killed so badly?

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,606
He had her fiancé murdered.

44
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,000
She wants payback.

45
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,640
That puts the fights with my father
in perspective.

46
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,729
I've been keeping tabs
on Helena over the past year.

47
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,850
Last known sighting was a month ago.
Palermo.

48
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,686
She's been busy.

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,640
If by busy you mean torturing and killing
mafiosos that might know where her father is.

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,484
Bertinelli's arrest just hit the wires.

51
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,803
How long do you think we have
before Helena books a ticket back home?

52
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,681
Go ahead.

53
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,683
Slade...

54
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,080
Please... Agh!

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,770
Why aren't we moving yet?

56
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,008
We managed to repair
the hull, but the, uh...

57
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,049
The engine's too damaged.

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,361
So fix it.

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,760
I can't.

60
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,121
I don't know how.

61
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,328
Then find somebody who does.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,685
Hi, my name's Laurel. I'm an alcoholic.

63
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,001
Hi, Laurel.

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,449
And this is actually
my second meeting today.

65
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,129
It's just, uh...

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,523
It's just so hard because I don't know
what to do with myself all day.

67
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,010
I'm a lawyer, but...

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,686
I was...

69
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,604
a lawyer.

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,489
I loved it.

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,407
But I guess I loved drinking more.

72
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,646
I know that I can make it down here
with all of you. I just...

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,724
I'm not sure I can make it out there.

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,446
Ah, anyway, thank you for letting me share.

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,924
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about the way things ended here.

76
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,610
No. Don't be.

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,641
You did me a favor, Adam.

78
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,641
It was the only way
I was gonna hit bottom, and...

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,766
And I did.

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,644
How about you do me a favor now?

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,966
Come back to work.

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,645
You want me back?

83
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm looking for someone to try
this case that just came in...

84
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,409
and, honestly, yours was the first name
that came to mind.

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,648
I'm still facing sanctions from the Bar.

86
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,561
I got a buddy on the disciplinary
committee. I squared things for you.

87
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,486
An S.C.P.D. raid last night
brought in Frank Bertinelli.

88
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,291
He came back to Starling
to collect on some old debts.

89
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,683
Now the DA's office is clear to prosecute
him, for you to prosecute him.

90
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,366
I appreciate the offer, Adam, but why me?

91
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,206
Well, there are RICO counts that your time
at CNRI make you ideally suited for.

92
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,203
Laurel, it's a case. If
you want it, it's yours.

93
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,249
But only if you're ready.

94
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,290
- What's the special occasion?
- I got paid.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,086
So if it's not nice
enough, you only have

96
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:56,991
yourself to blame for not
giving me that raise.

97
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh. Roy, I love it.

98
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,290
Thank you.

99
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,291
Hey, give me a second.
I forgot to put an order in.

100
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,851
Okay.

101
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,361
Hey, what's going on?

102
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,566
I got a line on Michael
Staton, Helena's fiancé.

103
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,469
Felicity, he's been
dead for five years.

104
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,007
Which makes the fact that he rented
a car last night very impressive.

105
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:24,032
That's Helena.

106
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,925
The car's got GPS. I'm hacked into it.

107
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,287
Yeah, she's headed straight
for Starling City.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,002
You ready to get back in the field?

109
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,491
I thought you'd never ask.

110
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,169
It's over, Helena.

111
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,964
Get out of the car!

112
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,725
Gun!

113
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,246
Don't hurt me!

114
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,690
Stand down.

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,764
Stand down.

116
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
- Don't hurt me!
- Speedy!

117
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,167
Enough.

118
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,683
He was just Helena's decoy.

119
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,201
Where is she?

120
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,646
I don't know.

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,401
Some chick just paid me
to take the car for a joy ride, I swear.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,650
Please don't kill me.

123
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,041
I'm getting married next month.

124
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,770
Just drive.

125
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,482
According to the S.C.P.D., the guy
that gave Helena a ride into town...

126
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,561
is a 22-year-old, poli-sci major at SCU,
and a member of Gamma Tau...

127
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,922
which totally explains
the whole "I didn't know"

128
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,147
"I was aiding and abetting
a known felon" thing.

129
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,721
Anyone with boobs
can get a frat boy to do anything.

130
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,530
- I was a frat boy.
- I rest my case.

131
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,001
At least she didn't kill him.
That's something.

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,329
- It's not like Helena to show restraint.
- Sounds like you have a type.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,287
Keep tabs on the police.

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,934
Let me know if they
get any leads on her.

135
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:26,990
I'll do some canvassing.

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,326
Hey.

137
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,690
You Okay?

138
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,520
By this time tomorrow,
it will be like nothing happened.

139
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,762
- That's one upside to the Mirakuru.
- The only one.

140
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,807
Look, I know what you're gonna say.
I had it under control last night.

141
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,361
So under control, that
I almost put another arrow in you.

142
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,554
I was gonna back off, you
never gave me a chance.

143
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:56,630
The only thing that snapped you out
of it, was when I brought up Thea.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,082
That's why you called me Speedy?

145
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,886
I thought you were trying to
give me a nickname.

146
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,850
- For the record, don't call me Speedy.
- Noted.

147
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,361
Roy, you're dangerous.

148
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,442
I thought I was helping you control it.

149
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,570
You are. I can't look at a bowl of water
without slapping it.

150
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,802
The first time that you're out in the field
in weeks...

151
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,726
and you're ready to kill somebody?
Come on.

152
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,882
I'm sorry, I should've asked you
to do this months ago.

153
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,881
Asked me to do what?

154
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,481
Stay away from Thea.

155
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,851
No.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,081
I can't.

157
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,884
She's not safe when she's around you.

158
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,801
I'm not sure anybody is
when you lose yourself to this rage.

159
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,290
You love her.

160
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,122
And that's why you're
gonna do what I'm asking.

161
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,123
Such a big uh-oh.

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,691
Helena?

163
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,410
Laurel.

164
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,762
ADA Adam Donner announced the return...

165
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,083
of Laurel Lance to the DA's office
after a brief sabbatical.

166
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,641
She will lead the prosecution
of Mr. Bertinelli.

167
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,484
Jury selection starts today.

168
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,406
Hey.

169
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,847
Hey, what are you doing here?

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,971
I heard you picked up some big new case
on the news. How come you didn't call me?

171
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,527
I was going to, but it
all happened so fast.

172
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,561
Plus, I thought you and dad would try and
talk me out of going back to work so soon.

173
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,441
- Which is why you're here.
- I'm just worried about you.

174
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,571
If you're worried I'm gonna slip, I'm
still going to two meetings a day and...

175
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,807
No, it's not that.

176
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,047
Everybody knows
what kind of guy Bertinelli is.

177
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,022
And not to mention his completely
psychotic daughter who's

178
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:53,628
already on her way back to
Starling City to kill him.

179
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,247
How do you know that?

180
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,209
I don't.

181
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,084
I just want you to be safe.

182
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,723
And I love you for caring.

183
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,203
But, Sara,
you've never seen me be a lawyer before.

184
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,408
And I'm really good at it.

185
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,403
And I miss it.

186
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,810
I have to run.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,128
I can't be late for court.

188
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,161
Yeah, this is much better
than the freighter.

189
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,209
You prefer boat, Hendrik?

190
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,522
Feel free to swim back.

191
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,126
Sara said Oliver survived here
for over a year.

192
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,441
We can do the same.

193
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,365
Unless Ivo and his men come find us.

194
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,488
We don't know what happened on the boat.

195
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,246
Who's alive and who's dead.

196
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,524
Sara. Are you there?

197
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,402
Slade. ls Oliver...?

198
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,528
He's in pain. Yes.

199
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,610
But he's still breathing.

200
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,886
For now.

201
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,283
Slade, listen, you won, okay?
You have the Amazo.

202
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,365
Just let Oliver go,
and then you can leave us here.

203
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,284
There's my problem, Sara.

204
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,010
I can't leave.

205
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,241
Why not?

206
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,883
During our assault, the ship's
engine was damaged. She won't sail.

207
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,044
During the attack, unfortunately,
I decapitated the engineer.

208
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,086
So, what can we do about our problem, Sara?

209
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,805
You want Oliver back.

210
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,804
And I need someone qualified
to fix this boat.

211
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,610
For Oliver's sake...

212
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,082
I sure hope a
Mr. Hendrik is there with you.

213
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,801
Non-lethal arrows?

214
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,570
It's not like you to play with kid gloves.

215
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,165
How's Roy?

216
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,121
Like Helena, he is not too pleased
with my skills as a mentor.

217
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,966
Laurel won't drop the case.
She's headed to court right now.

218
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,963
- Where are you going?
- To the courthouse.

219
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,930
Well, hey, you forgot your baby arrows.

220
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,266
Look, I get your whole
no-killing spree, but if it

221
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,314
comes down to saving Laurel
or killing Helena...

222
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,204
Sara, those aren't the only two choices.

223
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,263
You were happy enough to
let Dig take the kill

224
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,230
shot when it was Slade
threatening your family.

225
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,930
This is different.

226
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,726
I failed Helena.

227
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,282
I created the Huntress.

228
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,124
Yeah, well, you created Slade too.

229
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,444
You're right.

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,684
You're right.

231
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,922
But when it comes to our families...

232
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,129
neither one of us thinks clearly.

233
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,882
Which is why you have to stay here.

234
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,729
Ollie, I can't.

235
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,486
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to Laurel.

236
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,360
I love her too.

237
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,130
What do you guys think?

238
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,727
Oh, I think if the Huntress shows up,
you should totally kick her ass.

239
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,728
Please don't tell me you're
worried about me too.

240
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,681
No. I just wanted to watch the trial. I
heard the prosecutor was something special.

241
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,691
That's odd. Why are they bringing him in
through the front entrance?

242
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,966
Everybody, get down!

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,286
Hey, Dad.

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,330
Sorry I'm late,
but you're a hard man to track down.

245
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,601
But it's fitting that you came back
to Starling, where it all began.

246
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,723
Where you killed Michael.

247
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,368
You know, I almost feel sorry for you.

248
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,885
Helena.

249
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,165
Stop this.

250
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,891
Oliver, you know I can't.

251
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,930
Well, what are you waiting for?

252
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,000
I said, what are you waiting for?

253
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,485
Helena Bertinelli, put down your weapons...

254
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,564
and place your hands above your head.

255
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,449
So this was a big trap.

256
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,568
With you as the bait.

257
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,210
What did they offer you?

258
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,567
Oh, they didn't have to offer me anything.

259
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,724
Give up, Miss Bertinelli.
The building is surrounded.

260
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,890
What was it you always taught me, Daddy?

261
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,883
Be prepared for anything.

262
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,845
Now!

263
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,241
Take hostages and fall back.

264
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,451
Hey, hold your fire! Hold your fire!
They have hostages!

265
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,365
Hold fire. Say again, hold fire.
They've taken hostages.

266
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,400
Where's Laurel? Where's Laurel?
Is she with you?

267
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,884
I'm sorry, Mr. Lance, we got separated.

268
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,368
She's still inside.

269
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,040
We are live
outside the Starling City Courthouse...

270
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,766
where Helena Bertinelli
and an unknown number of assailants...

271
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,649
seized control of the entire building.

272
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,725
And I'm now being told they are
holding a number of hostages inside.

273
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,647
I want snipers with thermals on top of
every building for a two-block radius.

274
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,371
This was not
how it was supposed to go down, captain.

275
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,087
You promised me
there wouldn't be any casualties.

276
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,314
This was your idea, huh?
You son of a bitch!

277
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,029
Unh!

278
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,515
My daughter's in there!
What are you guys thinking,

279
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,667
putting those innocent lives at risk?
Get off!

280
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,525
- Listen. I was following orders.
- Orders?

281
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,168
All units, we have an incoming call.

282
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,249
Keep these airways clear. Airways clear.

283
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,043
Miss Bertinelli, no one has to die today.

284
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,531
My father does.

285
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,651
And unless you hand him over to me,
I'm gonna start killing hostages.

286
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,644
This, Mr. Donner, is what happens
when you let freaks with masks run wild.

287
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,523
- Get them the hell out of here.
- Don't touch me.

288
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,724
It's my mom.

289
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,043
- Detective.
- Helena Bertinelli just took 10 hostages.

290
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,406
Laurel's one of them.

291
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,211
Yeah, I'm aware of the situation.

292
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,924
Oliver, where are you? Are you okay?

293
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,526
I'm with Lance as Oliver.
And he just called the Arrow.

294
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,887
Oh. Oh!

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,721
It's getting really hard to keep track
of who knows whose secret identity.

296
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,450
Felicity, Laurel is still
inside the courthouse.

297
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,400
- What do you need, Oliver?
- My work clothes.

298
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,404
- I'm on it.
- Put Sara on the phone.

299
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,081
She's not here.

300
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,767
Where is she?

301
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,085
Are you one of the good guys?

302
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,122
No. But I'm friends with them.

303
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,362
- Dude, watch it.
- Screw you.

304
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,525
- Thea, we need to break up.
- What?

305
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,286
No.

306
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,290
What do you mean, no?
Thea, I'm breaking up with you.

307
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,891
No, you're not.

308
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,849
You can't make me date you.

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,891
Roy, yesterday you gave me
a bracelet worth every dime you had.

310
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,883
And now, what, you wanna end things?

311
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,486
Look, you're clearly going
through something right now.

312
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,644
And I'm not gonna let you
go through it alone.

313
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,247
I'm always gonna be here for you.

314
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,689
Sorry, Thea, the guy from the private party
said we stocked the wrong vodka.

315
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,927
And he's freaking me out.

316
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,004
We'll talk about this later, okay?

317
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
Are you hurt?

318
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,887
I'm so stupid.

319
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,125
Hey, you don't wanna do that.

320
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,046
Oh, no. Trust me, I do.

321
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,567
What about your sobriety?

322
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,922
How do you know about that?

323
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,048
The A.A. chip on your keychain.

324
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,125
Thirty days.

325
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,084
Do you even know why I'm here today?

326
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,722
Turns out I'm decoration.

327
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,087
Expendable decoration.

328
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,480
What do you mean?

329
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,561
This whole trial was a sham.

330
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,688
I should've seen it.

331
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,764
Sara was right.

332
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,489
Sara, she's my sister.

333
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,687
She said that I wasn't ready to come back.

334
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,526
I just thought she was
being overprotective.

335
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,921
Sisters can be like that.

336
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,650
You should meet mine.

337
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,365
She's gone through a lot.

338
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,845
She must have been so strong.

339
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,083
I just wanted to show her, show myself...

340
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,727
that I was still strong too.

341
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,928
So show me.

342
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,847
Let's go.

343
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,011
Where are you?

344
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,347
Inside. I've got Laurel Lance.
She's okay.

345
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,845
Is that the Arrow?

346
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,048
I'm headed to an egress
point, south wing.

347
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,073
Wait.

348
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,889
What about the other hostages?

349
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,565
You're just gonna leave them?

350
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,085
I need to get you to safety.

351
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,722
I don't understand.
What is so special about me?

352
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,042
- What's going on?
- She won't leave.

353
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,361
I know Helena.

354
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,846
She's gonna kill all of those people,
innocent people.

355
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,323
You wanted me to show you I'm strong.

356
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,927
This is me being strong. I'm staying.

357
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,849
Are you gonna help me or not?

358
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,684
Get her out of there now!

359
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,401
It's not like I can just knock her out.

360
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,688
I don't want you engaging Helena.

361
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,770
Are you afraid of what she'll do
or what I'll do?

362
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,003
Sara, you're not a killer.

363
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,766
I am what I need to be.

364
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,450
Sara, did you hear me?

365
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,681
I heard you.

366
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,691
Hendrik's not here.

367
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,403
There's someone I'd like
you to say hello to.

368
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,245
Don't give him anything, Sara.

369
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,291
Ollie.

370
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,762
One last chance. Oliver for Hendrik.

371
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,887
I told you. Hendrik, he didn't make it
to the island. He drowned.

372
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,931
To think, it was only a year ago,
you were a little college girl...

373
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,650
fretting about boys.

374
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,887
What's your point?

375
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,970
You're not a good liar.

376
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,806
Slade! Stop, please!
Look, he's your friend!

377
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,487
That is the sound of electricity
surging through my friend.

378
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,608
Five milliamps, to be exact.

379
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,888
Seven causes cardiac arrest.

380
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,405
Oliver just passed out with six milliamps.

381
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,804
He'll be delivered with the fatal
blow of seven in one hour...

382
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,084
if Hendrik is not
standing here by my side!

383
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,760
There's no way in hell
I'm going back there.

384
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,130
I was almost married once.

385
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,570
Agh.

386
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,130
It's been an hour.
And I'm a woman of my word.

387
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,084
Just ask my father.

388
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,283
No, please.

389
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,250
Everything's gonna be okay.

390
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,484
- Behind you!
- Agh!

391
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,166
Oliver sure does like
to dress up his girls.

392
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,641
Agh!

393
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,640
Are you all right?

394
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,290
Laurel. She's still in there.

395
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,284
Nice to see you again, Laurel.

396
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,565
Helena, listen to me.

397
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,048
- This has to end.
- I agree.

398
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,322
And it ends with my father in a box.

399
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,001
The police are never gonna
hand over your father.

400
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,522
No, they won't.
That's why you're gonna do it.

401
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,569
Simple trade.

402
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,200
My father, for Laurel.

403
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,966
Hey, guys, we need more vodka.

404
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,722
Okay. I'll get it myself.

405
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,723
- Where are you taking me?
- Safe house.

406
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,246
Listen. Front's mobbed with reporters.
Let's take Bertinelli out the back.

407
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,368
Bring the van around.

408
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,251
All right.

409
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,885
- What the hell? What's going on?
- Don't worry about it.

410
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,761
- Just get in the van.
- Hey! Hey!

411
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,811
- SWAT's ready to breach the courthouse.
- Then we make the trade now.

412
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,122
Listen, I'm not gonna lose
any sleep over Frank here,

413
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,228
but are you really gonna
serve him to his daughter?

414
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,964
No.

415
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,601
No one dies tonight.

416
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,483
Are you okay?

417
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,448
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- I said, no talking.

418
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,202
We talked that night.

419
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,647
You, Oliver, Tommy and I, at dinner.

420
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,566
I remember you telling me
your fiance was killed.

421
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,410
I'm so sorry.

422
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,128
Does this make us girlfriends?

423
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,964
No.

424
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,962
But I know what it's like to lose someone.

425
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,490
Oh.

426
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,722
Poor Laurel.

427
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,803
Did Tommy dump you?

428
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,650
No.

429
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,407
He died.

430
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,970
And I couldn't deal with it.

431
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,804
So I became a drunk.

432
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,087
Every problem I had...

433
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,925
I solved with a pill or a drink.

434
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,165
My friends and my family, they tried
to help me, but I wouldn't let them.

435
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,731
You don't have to do this, Helena.

436
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,804
It's not too late.

437
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,770
Yes, I do.

438
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,208
Because once you let the darkness inside...

439
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,283
it never comes out.

440
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,280
Helena, I have your father.

441
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,001
I want four-man teams.
Diamond formations.

442
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,162
Move fast. Shoot sharp.

443
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,244
One more thing:
Vigilantes are not the law.

444
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,051
If they're wearing a
mask, they get a bullet.

445
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,929
- Let's move out.
- Copy that.

446
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,046
Hands up, Bertinelli! Do it, now!

447
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,443
Please don't kill me! Please!

448
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,521
She told me, she told me to wear it
or she'd kill me.

449
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,841
Where the hell is she?

450
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,164
Don't look so scared, Laurel.
You might just live through this.

451
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,121
So, you're just gonna hand
me over to my daughter?

452
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:39,506
I thought you were
the good guys.

453
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,721
Shut up.

454
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,089
Remember all that stuff I said
about restraint? Forget about it.

455
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,164
Hey.

456
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,250
You can't stop someone like Helena
by becoming her.

457
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,007
I will do what I have to
to protect someone I love.

458
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,364
Hendrik, please, put the gun down.

459
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,888
Why? So you can send me back
to that hell hole? I don't think so.

460
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,283
It's not for any of us to decide
who lives and dies.

461
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,364
In Hendrik's case,
I'd be willing to make an exception.

462
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,481
I'm leaving. Don't stop me.

463
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,048
You're good at talking,
but you will not kill me.

464
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,645
Let's find out.

465
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,201
Sir, we got a ping off Miss Lance's
cell phone. She must still have it on her.

466
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,131
- Where?
- A machine shop at Gail Street and Simone.

467
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,368
Should we rally up there?

468
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,523
- Negative. Hold your location.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,685
Sergeant, keep this position.

470
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,162
Well, this is irony for you, Dad.

471
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,806
Didn't you have Jimmy D'Agostino's body
buried under the building next door?

472
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,887
I'm sorry, my girl.

473
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,127
Now you're about to die, I'm sure you are.

474
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,566
No.

475
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,691
I'm sorry for that little girl
I used to take to ballet class.

476
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,689
And go on ski trips with.

477
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,602
The one I used to help
with her math homework.

478
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,683
She hated math.

479
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,051
I'm sorry that I caused her so much hurt.

480
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,283
Because she brought me so much joy.

481
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,848
Helena, don't kill him.

482
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,604
You can never come back from that.

483
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,485
It's too late. I'm already gone.

484
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,602
Goodbye, Dad.

485
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,205
Damn vigilantes!

486
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,250
You are not above the law!

487
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,884
The last time this happened,
I threw you out a window.

488
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,921
I was holding back.

489
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,241
I won't do that again.

490
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,530
- Hey.
- Unh.

491
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,407
No!

492
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,361
You're not a killer.

493
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,047
You don't know who I am, Laurel.
Not really.

494
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:09,072
Then show me.

495
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,525
No.

496
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,090
It was supposed to be me.

497
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,249
- It was supposed to be me who did it.
- That's enough.

498
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,441
Go.

499
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,849
How did you get in here?

500
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,643
My family makes a generous donation
to the policeman's retirement fund.

501
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,644
Every once in a while I
get to call in a favor.

502
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,044
Maybe you can ask them to send me to prison
somewhere tropical.

503
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,042
You know, I thought I'd feel different.

504
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,010
Now that he's dead, but I don't.

505
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,211
You always told me that...

506
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,170
killing him wouldn't change anything.

507
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,202
You were right.

508
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,168
But I was wrong too.

509
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,729
About what?

510
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,283
I thought I could help you.

511
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,450
Stop you from being a killer.

512
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,691
But I was just starting.

513
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,403
And I was a killer too.

514
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,081
What are you now?

515
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,568
I'm trying to be better.

516
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,085
It's so stupid, but...

517
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,765
I keep thinking, now that he's dead...

518
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,810
my father and Michael are together.

519
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,809
And I'm still here. Alone.

520
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,800
You're not alone.

521
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,130
What are you doing to me?

522
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,962
In Roman times...

523
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,963
a criminal was branded...

524
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,124
to identify his crimes to the world.

525
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,082
And to forever remind him
of what he'd done.

526
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,806
Ash! Unh!

527
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,726
Shado wore this tattoo on her back.

528
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,169
Now you shall wear it for
the rest of your life.

529
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,971
However short that might be.

530
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,727
Slade, Slade.

531
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,087
Hello, Sara.

532
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,330
I hope you've made the right choice.

533
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,250
Yes.

534
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,209
Look, on behalf of the entire DA's office,
I have to apologize.

535
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,409
Adam Donner's employment here
has been terminated.

536
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,961
Obviously, we had no idea
what he was plotting.

537
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,690
I would hope not.

538
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,000
Unfortunately, Adam was not authorized
to offer you your job back.

539
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,960
I'm sorry, but nothing's changed.

540
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,889
Yes, it has.

541
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,201
Excuse me?

542
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,291
You are going to rehire me, Kate.

543
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,881
Unless you feel like
explaining to the press...

544
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,567
that your own assistant district
attorney was the brilliant mastermind...

545
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,404
behind tonight's hostage crisis.

546
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,007
Welcome back.

547
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,324
I have to say, I am impressed.

548
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,251
I would've thought blackmail
was a little dark for you.

549
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,402
Someone recently told me:

550
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,405
"Once you let the darkness inside...

551
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,042
it never comes out."

552
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,084
Hey.

553
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,769
What are you still doing up here?

554
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,288
Thinking. Crying.

555
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,446
Roy and I are...

556
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,445
What happened?

557
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,205
I caught him with some slut.

558
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,560
Right over there, actually.

559
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,083
I'm sorry.

560
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,969
He was doing it to push me away,
which clearly worked.

561
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,647
No, I just... I don't know why.

562
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,204
Why is it so hard for everyone
just to tell the truth?

563
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,161
I mean, Roy can't even tell me the truth
about why he wants to end things with me.

564
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,483
Mom, she...

565
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,003
She keeps all of these secrets.

566
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,283
I mean, doesn't it...? Doesn't it feel like
she's still keeping something from us?

567
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,805
I don't know, Thea.

568
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,365
You're the only one
that doesn't lie to me, Ollie.

569
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,527
You're the only one I know
who doesn't keep secrets from me.

570
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,767
I gotta go.

571
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,844
Let me drive you.

572
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,361
I just wanna be alone right now.

573
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,883
Is she okay?

574
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,042
She will be.

575
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,722
Eventually.

576
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,044
You did good tonight.

577
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,366
That's what heroes do, right?

578
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,003
It's a dangerous city.

579
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,202
You shouldn't be out on the streets alone.

580
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,930
Mr. Wilson?

581
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,604
Please.

582
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,250
Call me Slade.
