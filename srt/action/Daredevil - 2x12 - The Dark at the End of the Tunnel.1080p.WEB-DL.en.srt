1
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:44,766
Ellie, come here.

2
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,814
How are your hands?

3
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:52,398
They hurt.

4
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,317
It's 'cause you're bending your wrist.

5
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:57,904
Hmm.

6
00:00:57,988 --> 00:00:59,280
Make a fist.

7
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,408
Lock your wrist.

8
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:03,575
All right. This is a punch.

9
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:06,287
This is a punch.
This is a punch.

10
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:10,125
That's shit.

11
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,045
Lock your wrist,
breathe like I taught you.

12
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:15,421
- There's a man watching us.
- Forget him.

13
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,104
He's not watching them.
He's watching me.

14
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:19,676
The fight is that way, girl.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,635
Go out and finish it.

16
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,230
- She's impressive.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,024
Where did you say you found her, again?

18
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:37,444
Box of Cracker Jacks.

19
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,867
Still needs refining.

20
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:48,747
Perhaps with more discipline
or different training.

21
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:50,248
Left hand up, child.

22
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:02,301
When the war finally comes,
we're gonna need real warriors.

23
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:15,982
You were saying?

24
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,529
She's killing him!

25
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:24,616
No shit. Ellie.

26
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,868
Ellie!

27
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,790
Ellie. Ellie.

28
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,168
Slow it down.

29
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,504
Drop your breath.

30
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:41,465
Breathe in your stomach.

31
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:43,176
Nice work.

32
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,552
<i>You told me to fight.</i>

33
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:46,303
You told me to finish it.

34
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:48,098
I didn't tell you to kill him.

35
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,225
He is an asshole,
but at the end of the day,

36
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:53,685
he's on our side of the war.

37
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,981
And it's wrong to kill one of ours.

38
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:57,564
It didn't feel wrong.

39
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:01,736
Listen.

40
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,533
Whatever it is that you got inside you...

41
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:12,664
whatever it is that burns so hot,
that's good.

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,624
But you gotta learn to control it.

43
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:18,796
You said we're going to war.

44
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:20,754
We are.

45
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:25,510
And there'll be a time and place
for you to turn yourself loose.

46
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:27,011
But right now,

47
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:29,721
the last thing you want
is for everybody here to be...

48
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:32,016
scared shitless of you.

49
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:35,019
Tame that fire...

50
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:36,897
or they'll tame it for you.

51
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:39,690
Get me?

52
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,233
- I get you.
- Good.

53
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:44,196
'Cause that was just a warm-up.

54
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,074
Come on out here.

55
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,910
Show me what you can really do.

56
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:57,834
That the best you can do?

57
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,251
You haven't seen my best.

58
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,338
Well, what are you waiting for?
Christmas?

59
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:23,735
- You tried to have me killed.
- You got that right.

60
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,362
- Why, Stick?
- It's a long story.

61
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:53,932
Now, what do you think you're doing?

62
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,766
You have no right here, Matthew.

63
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,936
Too little, too late, Matty.

64
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,980
- Get out or get hurt.
- That's not happening, Stick!

65
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,609
- I'm not gonna let you kill him.
- Not your choice.

66
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:09,155
He raised you, Elektra.

67
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,323
Then he tried to kill me!

68
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,994
I should've done it years ago.

69
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,662
Shut up, Stick.
You're just as bad as she is.

70
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:17,247
Not quite.

71
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:19,540
I tried to housebreak her.
Impossible.

72
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:22,085
You're just another old man
jealous of his disciple.

73
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,213
You'd rather see me dead than outgrow you.
Well, guess what?

74
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:30,093
When it comes to killing,
I've always been better.

75
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,013
- Put up or shut up.
- No! Put it down!

76
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,429
They're gone.

77
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,600
Yeah. And they took Stick.

78
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:36,783
How do they do that?

79
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:37,910
Why did you interrupt us?

80
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:39,674
Because you would have
killed him, Elektra.

81
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,665
Yes! Before he killed me.

82
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,376
Is that so offensive
to your precious "code"?

83
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,336
Tell me this.
Why does Stick want you dead?

84
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:47,420
What does it matter?

85
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:49,672
It matters because Stick never does
anything without a reason.

86
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:51,556
All right?
And the Hand, they didn't kill him.

87
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,759
They captured him,
which means he knows something.

88
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:56,804
And they're gonna rip him to shreds
until they find out what it is.

89
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,223
Good.

90
00:06:58,305 --> 00:06:59,473
Unless...

91
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,934
Unless we get there first.

92
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:05,480
You want me to help you save the man
who ordered my death?

93
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:06,814
Yes.

94
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:10,443
You really do hate me.

95
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,819
No, Elektra.

96
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:15,156
This isn't about you, all right?
This is about Stick.

97
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,117
I need to know why the Hand took him.

98
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,785
And more importantly,
what they're planning next.

99
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:21,621
I'm done fighting his war.

100
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:23,956
All right, fine.
Then I'm gonna go alone.

101
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,708
You've pushed everyone out of your life...

102
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,545
and now you want to put
the little you have left

103
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:30,338
on protecting
that broken old man?

104
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:33,590
That broken old man...
He gave me a life when I was...

105
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,011
When I had nothing, when I was alone.

106
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:38,095
He was the one who was there for me.

107
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:40,432
He abandoned you.

108
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:43,725
Just when you needed him the most...

109
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:46,562
because that's what he does.

110
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,855
I don't care what Stick did.

111
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,319
I'm gonna save him.

112
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:55,946
Not if I get to him first.

113
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,992
I'm going to kill him.

114
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,954
And if you get in my way, Matthew...

115
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,708
I'm gonna kill you, too.

116
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:15,401
Ready?

117
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:16,944
Yeah.

118
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:18,237
All right.

119
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,801
Also, uh, let's...

120
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:43,679
I know that the fingerprints
were probably burned...

121
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:45,806
But let's get some prints taken anyways.

122
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,107
You know you can go home now, right?

123
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:58,109
Uh, yeah.

124
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,362
You don't need anything else?

125
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:01,613
I have your statement.

126
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:04,409
If I have any more questions,
I can track you down.

127
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:06,203
And don't worry...

128
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:09,539
that so-called
"police protection" I gave you?

129
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,708
They're crossing guards in Yonkers now.

130
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,086
What? No.

131
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,463
No, no, no.
Brett, really, there's...

132
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,088
There's nothing they could do.
It wasn't their fault.

133
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:19,591
Frank followed me.
He kidnapped me.

134
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,968
Well, thank Christ
you managed to get away.

135
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,679
Not many people can say that
about the Punisher.

136
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,973
Seriously, go home.

137
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:30,267
Get some sleep.
Ambien's the real deal.

138
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:33,354
Look...

139
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,690
I know what you're thinking.

140
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:41,445
Maybe Castle survived.
Maybe he's still out there.

141
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:42,780
He ain't.

142
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,117
How can you be sure?
You ID him yet?

143
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,246
There's 20 burned bodies.
It takes time.

144
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:52,248
- So there's a chance.
- You saw the same explosion I did.

145
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,041
You're safe, Karen.

146
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,212
That nightmare you've been living,
it's over.

147
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:59,130
Frank Castle's a dead man.

148
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:03,218
- Thompson!
- Huh?

149
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,429
Get her a lift.
Wherever she wants to go.

150
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:08,430
Get out of here, Karen.

151
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Hey.

152
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:32,163
Sorry, just, uh, research.

153
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:33,872
Looking for something.

154
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:36,315
I paid the electric bill
through the end of the month, so...

155
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,377
enjoy it while you can.

156
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:39,962
And then what?

157
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:42,631
And then it'll be cold and dark.

158
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:48,054
It's really over, huh?

159
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:49,305
Nelson and Murdock?

160
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,642
You told me to move on.
That's what I'm doing.

161
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:00,982
Look, Foggy...

162
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,612
I'm sorry I never made it
to the hospital.

163
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:06,863
It's been...

164
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,160
- a crazy couple of days.
- I heard.

165
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:14,121
Marci came by, though.

166
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:15,457
Some of the higher-ups at her firm

167
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,860
were impressed with my opening argument
in the Castle case.

168
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:19,669
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

169
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:23,088
Neither am I.
Not anymore.

170
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,093
Castle case was in many ways a disaster,
but...

171
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:29,471
it made me realize
I'm really good at my job.

172
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,891
Nelson and Murdock
was never just your job.

173
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,435
It was you.

174
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:39,676
You're there for every client
who comes through the door.

175
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,189
Rich, poor...

176
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,525
doesn't matter.

177
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,449
You're the heart of this place.

178
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,996
You gonna try to convince me
it's worth another shot?

179
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,001
No.

180
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,636
Oh, hey, look, I'm...
I'm done here anyway.

181
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,637
So... you stay. I'll go.

182
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,808
What are you looking for?

183
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:18,477
You really wanna know?

184
00:13:20,353 --> 00:13:21,606
Sure.

185
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:27,236
Well, there's this...
group that I've been following.

186
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,822
They move through the city,
and then they just...

187
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:30,906
disappear.

188
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,449
Like magic.

189
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:35,243
The last place I had a fix on them
was 49th and 10th.

190
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:36,413
Then they were gone.

191
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:39,165
I thought maybe they
might be using the subway tunnels.

192
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:40,458
Only if they're idiots.

193
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,752
Subway tunnels are heavily patrolled
and dangerous as shit.

194
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:47,964
My grandfather used to tell me stories
about abandoned railway tunnels.

195
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:50,593
- Abandoned? Why?
- They kept caving in.

196
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:53,054
Cost a ton. The city just finally
threw in the towel...

197
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,430
Gated them up.

198
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:56,306
Best thing to ever happen
to bootleggers like Grandpa.

199
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,642
Said he could go for miles
without seeing daylight.

200
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:01,478
Whoever this group is...

201
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,482
forget magic.
Look for manhole covers.

202
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,943
Yeah, that's...
Thank you, Foggy.

203
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,986
That's really good work.
Thank you.

204
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:10,697
That's what I do.

205
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:13,866
Hey, you, uh...

206
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,372
What?

207
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,586
Did you want me to convince you?

208
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,795
- Of what?
- This.

209
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:29,965
Us. You know,
giving Nelson and Murdock another shot?

210
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:31,843
I was hoping you would.

211
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,844
Relieved when you didn't.

212
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,765
Last step was us both admitting it.

213
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,934
Now... we're done.

214
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:41,078
Hey.

215
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:43,705
Hey, I've got a guy
on the scanners here.

216
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,290
He tells me 20 people are dead.

217
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:46,793
Yeah, well, I wasn't one of 'em.

218
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:49,336
Yeah. Well, thank God.

219
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
Huh?

220
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:57,136
So, uh, what, that's...

221
00:15:57,218 --> 00:16:00,264
the third time you've been in
Frank Castle's crosshairs and escaped?

222
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,724
Just lucky, I guess.

223
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,680
Yeah, well, we both know
that's a load of shit,

224
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,649
but, you know,
just in case I'm deposed one day,

225
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:09,108
we'll say you're the luckiest lady
on the planet. Deal?

226
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:12,488
Great, great.

227
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:15,365
How's the, um...
How's the story coming?

228
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:17,365
- There isn't one.
- How do you figure?

229
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:18,991
Because everyone is dead.

230
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,206
Reyes, Blacksmith, Frank Castle.

231
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,579
- They're all dead.
- Mmm-hmm.

232
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:26,040
So anyone who was involved
in the cover-up,

233
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:27,248
or screwed over by it, is gone.

234
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,043
So there are no more stakes.
There's no reason to write it.

235
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:31,212
So what am I supposed
to fill Sunday's paper with?

236
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,298
Crossword puzzles.

237
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:36,092
Look, look, Karen, Karen...

238
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,094
I understand that this whole
journalism thing is new to you,

239
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,137
but a real journalist
doesn't just up and quit.

240
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:43,558
- Well, that's not fair.
- That's exactly fair!

241
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,017
Stories don't disappear, they...

242
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,477
they change.
They become different stories.

243
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:48,604
Change?

244
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,814
I'm exhausted.
I need to go home.

245
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:53,067
I need... I need a shower.
I need to eat, I need to sleep.

246
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,318
I...

247
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,322
Why do you care so much
about Frank Castle? Hmm?

248
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:00,742
I mean, maybe once upon a time

249
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:02,743
this was about whether or not
he was innocent or some sort of,

250
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,036
you know, psycho murderer,

251
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,079
but that ship sailed a long time ago,

252
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:08,165
along with your career
at Nelson and Murdock.

253
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,876
So...
So why do you still care?

254
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,337
Because he is not
a psycho murderer.

255
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:17,090
He wasn't a psycho murderer.

256
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:20,720
I don't know how you...
He killed 30-something people.

257
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:24,640
His family was gunned down
in front of his face.

258
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:27,143
Now, what he did was wrong...

259
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:29,686
but no one, including your paper,

260
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,772
ever mentioned the fact
that he was a father...

261
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:33,023
and a husband, grieving,

262
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:35,567
looking for answers,
and you, more than anyone,

263
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:37,485
should understand why that matters to me.

264
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:41,823
So you're...
you're saying there's more to him.

265
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:48,830
- Yes.
- So is this story over?

266
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,752
Fine.

267
00:17:53,836 --> 00:17:55,036
- You're right.
- Yeah, I know.

268
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:56,798
Get used to it.

269
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,715
So, what?
So, it's not...

270
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,135
it's not an exposé anymore, it's what?

271
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:04,555
- It's a... profile?
- Yeah.

272
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:08,184
Which means...
I need more sources.

273
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,144
Uh, like personal contacts, right?

274
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:11,520
Like someone who knew him
outside the trial?

275
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:13,188
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Sunday's coming.

276
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,566
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

277
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:20,236
I might be able to get someone.

278
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,321
Maybe.

279
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:23,907
- Okay.
- Uh, leave it.

280
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:26,534
It's time to face the truth, Karen Page.

281
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:27,953
This is your home now.

282
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:30,915
Go.

283
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:33,316
<i>Thank you for seeing me so late.</i>

284
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:34,704
<i>I hope I'm not disturbing your family.</i>

285
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:37,040
Oh, no, no, no.
I have teenagers.

286
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:39,961
They haven't been home
on a Friday night in years.

287
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:42,838
Can I get you some coffee?

288
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,924
You know, no, thanks,
I'm ten cups in already.

289
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,425
Ah, Castle would call that "a good start."

290
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:51,387
I know I'm old.
My wife calls me cranky.

291
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:55,600
All the violence these days,
the media would have you believe

292
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:57,603
that that's all there is in the world.

293
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:01,732
I'm glad you're writing
this article about Frank.

294
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:03,608
The real Frank.

295
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:05,319
- Well, that's the goal.
- Uh-huh.

296
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:08,280
To show people that Mr. Castle
wasn't just the Punisher.

297
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:09,490
Right, although...

298
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,993
how is it a lawyer
is writing for a newspaper?

299
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:15,495
Uh, no. I was a legal assistant.

300
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:16,788
Past tense?

301
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:19,790
Uh, turns out,
I just have a knack for this.

302
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:22,127
Oh, I see.

303
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,544
Uh, may I?

304
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:25,213
Oh, yes, of course.
That's what they're there for.

305
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,673
Thanks.

306
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:32,512
During the trial, you talked aloud
about Castle as a Marine.

307
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:33,805
Our primary bond.

308
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:37,643
Mmm. Talked about respect and gratitude.

309
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,357
You know, honestly...

310
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,194
you're the only person I can find that has
anything kind at all to say about him.

311
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,155
- Mmm.
- So I, um...

312
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:53,450
I guess my question is...

313
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:55,743
did you like him?

314
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:59,830
- Like him?
- Well, like, um...

315
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:03,501
as a man? As a... a friend?

316
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,338
You know, it's funny.

317
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,758
When you're fighting a war,
you don't really make friends.

318
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,219
At least, not if
you're fighting it the right way.

319
00:22:12,303 --> 00:22:13,423
Mmm.

320
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:15,475
I suppose you don't want
to get close to anyone,

321
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:18,303
because, hey, you're...

322
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:19,971
you're not all coming back.

323
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:22,726
But at the same time, you...

324
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:24,607
you have to feel something, don't you?

325
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,620
Otherwise, what are you all fighting for?

326
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,656
I remember Frank
used to sing this horrible little song.

327
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:38,954
He had, uh,
picked it up, I think,

328
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,872
from one of his kids' TV shows
when he was on leave,

329
00:22:40,956 --> 00:22:42,915
and he brought it back
to Afghanistan with him,

330
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,251
and it was infectious.

331
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:47,378
It went through everything like a virus.

332
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:50,007
Worse than malaria.
Used to crack him up.

333
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,883
I don't know...

334
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,727
I don't know
that I ever saw Frank like that.

335
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:56,262
You probably never saw him
do impressions, either.

336
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:57,598
- Impressions?
- Yes.

337
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:58,682
Of, like, famous people?

338
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:02,853
Uh, well, I only ever saw him do me,
but he had a knack for it, really.

339
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:07,273
A sixth sense about
ticks and subconscious behaviors,

340
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:09,151
and the way a brain works.

341
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,363
It was spot-on, really.

342
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:15,241
Unnerving, the way he could
look into a person's soul.

343
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:22,748
I think I know what you mean.

344
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,165
Well...

345
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:30,130
wherever Frank is now, I hope he finds
that better part of himself again.

346
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:38,805
Uh, Colonel...

347
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:44,352
did you happen to catch
the news last night?

348
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:46,605
Um, there was a shipyard explosion.

349
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:50,983
Yes. Yes, I think I did hear
something about that.

350
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,111
A drug deal gone south
or something?

351
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:54,954
- Right. Yes, something like that.
- Mmm-hmm.

352
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:58,158
Uh, well, just between you and me, um...

353
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:02,870
the NYPD's keeping things under wraps
until the investigation is complete.

354
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:04,165
But...

355
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,418
Frank was involved.

356
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:09,877
Oh.

357
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:13,089
He was on the ship when it went up.

358
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:18,345
Police are sure?

359
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:20,472
Uh, well, they don't have
an ID yet, but...

360
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:23,349
Sorry, I just...

361
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:29,147
You know, I was at the docks all night,
into the morning,

362
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,982
watching them just pull bodies
out of the water,

363
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,319
and there's no way anyone could've...

364
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,960
After a war,
some men turn their backs on you.

365
00:24:51,462 --> 00:24:52,878
They want to forget.

366
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,715
Not Gosnell.

367
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:58,594
No.

368
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:04,890
He took the worst part of an IED
on a recon, north of Kabul.

369
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,893
Left half his face on a dirt road.

370
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:10,062
Spent the better part of a year
in a hospital...

371
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:12,691
but that kid never gave up.

372
00:25:13,817 --> 00:25:15,277
Never gave in.

373
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,533
It's late.

374
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:26,454
I'll get out of your hair.
I think I have everything that I need.

375
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,626
Once he got out, he tracked me down.

376
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:34,546
Asked me how he could serve me again.

377
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:38,800
That boy was the definition of "loyal."

378
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:45,265
Or was.

379
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:49,310
Before Frank Castle murdered him.

380
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,480
Colonel, please. I just...

381
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,316
I just think I should go.

382
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:56,693
I'll walk you out.

383
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:11,184
You're doing it wrong, kid.

384
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,356
If you can hear me,
we got a shot.

385
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:16,482
He's delirious.

386
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:19,024
Then we change tactics.

387
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:23,446
I give you one last opportunity
to keep this conversation civilized.

388
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,241
Listen very carefully.

389
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:27,367
You've been tracking their weapons.

390
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,034
So they dropped 'em.

391
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,423
Tracking heartbeats is kids' stuff.

392
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:43,215
Time to go deeper.

393
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,760
Track their breath.

394
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:48,763
Sooner or later, they gotta...

395
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:50,682
exhale.

396
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:52,224
When they do...

397
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,435
Where is it?

398
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,936
...kick their ass.

399
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:19,168
Nice work, kid.

400
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:21,338
He leaves us no choice.

401
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,383
Sit back and relax.

402
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:25,759
<i>Relax, shiro.</i>

403
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:28,761
The answer will come
to you soon, I am sure.

404
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:47,196
Listen, I won't write the story.
I won't write anything.

405
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,906
- Shut up.
- I'll...

406
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,033
Look, no one will be suspicious,
I'm not even a real reporter.

407
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:52,493
Just get in the car.

408
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:01,919
Start the car.

409
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:09,720
Where are we going?

410
00:29:09,802 --> 00:29:11,221
Start the goddamn car.

411
00:29:15,642 --> 00:29:17,482
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Don't make any...

412
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:27,820
Start driving.

413
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:29,280
Drive!

414
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,743
Turn that shit off.

415
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,791
Could've been smart.

416
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,463
Could've let the story go down
with that boat.

417
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:46,464
"The real Castle."

418
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:48,215
Like you cared about him.

419
00:29:52,387 --> 00:29:53,638
Yeah, pull over here.

420
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:56,932
Pull over.

421
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:36,514
Is he close?

422
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:41,686
Perhaps. It does not matter.

423
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,480
We will continue until he breaks.

424
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,040
Only thing gonna crack tonight

425
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:06,837
is your skull... asshole!

426
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:35,741
You okay?

427
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,367
I've been better.

428
00:31:38,784 --> 00:31:39,869
Come on.

429
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:42,498
You did good, kid.

430
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,915
You did good.

431
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,712
No, I just...
I just did what you taught me, Stick.

432
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:50,547
Matty, I'm...

433
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:52,758
proud of you.

434
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:59,430
Come on, old man.
Let's get you out of here.

435
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,144
Hello, boys.

436
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:10,399
Do you remember when we met...

437
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:13,529
you told me you'd never abandon me?

438
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:17,991
It's funny. For the life of me...

439
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:21,243
I can't remember
being so naive I'd believe you.

440
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:23,871
But I did.

441
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:27,291
And now here we are.

442
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:28,855
- Elektra.
- Don't be a bore, Matthew.

443
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:32,630
Why don't you scurry out of here
and let me finish what I came to do?

444
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,887
I told you,
I'm not gonna let you kill him.

445
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,889
And I told you, too bad.

446
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,293
- You let her track you.
- She's not gonna hurt you, Stick.

447
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,812
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

448
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:48,980
Look at that.

449
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:53,318
After all you've done,
you're still a disappointment to Daddy.

450
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:56,236
- I'm getting him out of here.
- He's not going anywhere.

451
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,408
Neither are you, child.
They got you right where they want you.

452
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:04,203
It's painful, raising children.

453
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:06,956
We spend our lives
teaching them to be strong,

454
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,084
to be independent.

455
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,127
Not realizing that
once we have achieved that...

456
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:15,214
they are no longer in our control.

457
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:16,800
Nobu.

458
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:27,018
Tell them.

459
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:29,395
Tell them why we're all here tonight.

460
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:31,481
You...

461
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:33,608
the loyal one...

462
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:34,984
and it.

463
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:10,394
I'm sorry about before.
I should've stopped, but...

464
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:39,026
<i>Did you really think you could
get away with bringing it here?</i>

465
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:40,591
Your kid attacked her.

466
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:42,551
You've endangered all of us.

467
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:44,470
You know what they'll do to you
when they find out?

468
00:34:44,553 --> 00:34:46,722
There are larger pieces at play here.

469
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,348
Oh, you're out of your mind.

470
00:34:48,432 --> 00:34:51,812
You know what it is, what it can do.

471
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:53,146
Stop.

472
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:56,274
You've gone soft for that thing,
Stick.

473
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:00,653
If you won't kill it... I will.

474
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,198
Just stop. You're right.

475
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,700
She's my responsibility.

476
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,705
I'll take care of her.

477
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,011
Gotta go.

478
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:31,517
Nobu, you let these two go...

479
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,144
and you can have me.

480
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:34,979
I need it.

481
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:36,939
Call me "it" again
and I'll cut you in half.

482
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:39,901
You are right, Elektra.

483
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,111
You're not a girl anymore.

484
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:43,905
But now, seeing you fight,

485
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:47,117
seeing you with the man
who saved your life...

486
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,285
I'd know you anywhere.

487
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:52,455
Do you know who we are?

488
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:55,249
You call yourselves the Hand.

489
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:57,502
Do you know who we serve?

490
00:35:57,584 --> 00:36:01,006
Yeah. Some mythical piece of shit
called the Black Sky.

491
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:02,256
What is this?

492
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:06,343
The end of the war you don't believe in.

493
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:07,845
We just lost.

494
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:11,767
The Black Sky... is not a myth.

495
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,144
We have wanted you since you were a child.

496
00:36:15,227 --> 00:36:16,687
You were taken from us...

497
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:19,606
but now you have returned.

498
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:22,443
What the hell are you talking about?

499
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:24,694
It's you, Elektra.

500
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:28,408
You are the Black Sky.

501
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,285
Our greatest living weapon.

502
00:36:31,368 --> 00:36:32,577
No.

503
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:43,506
Elektra, do not listen to him, all right?
It's a trick.

504
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:47,468
It's another illusion, another game.
He wants something from you.

505
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:51,722
He told me I was out of control.

506
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,935
They don't get to tell you what you are.

507
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:57,187
But you said the same thing.

508
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:58,949
Well, I was wrong.
No one gets to tell you.

509
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:01,274
But it makes sense, right?

510
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:03,276
No.

511
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:07,196
Only if you let it.

512
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,156
It explains everything.

513
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:24,964
You knew all along.

514
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:28,551
Yeah, I did.

515
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:31,136
That's why they hated me.

516
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:36,142
That's why everyone eventually does.

517
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:39,354
Elektra, you still have a choice.
The woman I know is still in there.

518
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:42,816
Is she?

519
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:44,943
You are home now.

520
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:52,283
We live and die
to serve you, Black Sky.

521
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,039
No, Jesus.

522
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:03,086
- Elektra.
- If what they say is true...

523
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:07,381
I studied it, as a child,
with the Chaste.

524
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:11,801
I committed it to memory,
so I could fight it one day.

525
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,392
But there's no fight anymore.

526
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:21,021
The Black Sky is destiny.

527
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:23,772
No. Elektra. Elektra.

528
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,066
- Leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave you, I...

529
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:26,151
Leave!

530
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:29,486
<i>Why are they taking so long?</i>

531
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:32,573
This Ambassador and his wife,

532
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:36,243
the only thing they can't have
is a little girl of their own.

533
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:37,412
Now, they'll have you.

534
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:39,080
They'll never have me.

535
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:45,002
Kid, use your head.
Watch these people.

536
00:38:45,086 --> 00:38:46,629
Watch everything about 'em.

537
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:50,341
How they walk, how they talk,
how they eat. All of it.

538
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:54,511
Playing someone else, someone fancy...

539
00:38:56,472 --> 00:38:58,348
that's a good skill
to have in your pocket.

540
00:38:58,432 --> 00:39:00,142
Why can't I stay with you?

541
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:02,394
'Cause we'll be hunted
the rest of our lives.

542
00:39:02,477 --> 00:39:03,897
We can take them.

543
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:08,984
Ellie...

544
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:13,238
I haven't told you everything, but...

545
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:18,535
someday, someone will come for you.

546
00:39:18,618 --> 00:39:20,037
And everything will change.

547
00:39:21,497 --> 00:39:24,584
I'm gonna make that
as far off as possible.

548
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:27,921
You'll train someone else.
I know you will.

549
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:34,010
You... You'll forget about me.

550
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,763
Forget my Ellie?

551
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,691
Never.

552
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:01,495
<i>I pretended my whole life.</i>

553
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:04,499
I tried.

554
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,919
I tried to control this inside me.

555
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:14,591
Maybe I don't have to anymore.

556
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:18,095
Maybe this is my chance.

557
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:20,347
To what?

558
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,267
To be loved?

559
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:29,149
Yes.

560
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:31,734
Then don't let me get in your way.

561
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,955
I am the enemy of the Hand.

562
00:40:47,624 --> 00:40:48,709
So kill me.

563
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,975
It's too late. Let me go.

564
00:41:06,894 --> 00:41:10,647
Now you could either try and kill us,
and prove them right.

565
00:41:12,024 --> 00:41:13,651
Or you could save Stick...

566
00:41:14,943 --> 00:41:16,861
and prove them wrong.

567
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:19,740
You never know when to give up, do you?

568
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:21,283
No.

569
00:41:23,577 --> 00:41:24,828
And neither does he.

570
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:57,986
Ahh!

571
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:00,341
Frank.

572
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:12,227
You should be
at the bottom of the Hudson.

573
00:43:12,312 --> 00:43:16,731
Losing $100 million in heroin
would've been worth it to take you down.

574
00:43:16,816 --> 00:43:18,776
But here we are, huh?

575
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:22,446
You could've been part of it,
like Gosnell.

576
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:24,573
You could've been rich.

577
00:43:24,656 --> 00:43:27,577
And maybe you could've taken your family

578
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,330
to the Bahamas
instead of Central Park, huh?

579
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:35,584
You think this...

580
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,419
all of this...

581
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:39,504
is about a bad drug deal?

582
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:42,175
That's what you see.

583
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:45,470
You're losing your touch, Frank.

584
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:49,515
Your kids, at the park?

585
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:53,769
Nah. Who cares?
That's never what this has been about.

586
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,772
It's about what happened with you.

587
00:43:57,856 --> 00:44:00,943
With all of us. Kandahar.

588
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:09,785
You think they would ever let that go?

589
00:44:09,868 --> 00:44:12,497
Frank, stop.

590
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,039
You don't have to kill him.

591
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:15,790
Go back to the car.

592
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:17,042
What's he talking about?

593
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:19,002
- Kandahar, what's that...
- What happened?

594
00:44:19,086 --> 00:44:21,381
- Go.
- Did you do something?

595
00:44:22,423 --> 00:44:25,091
If they come after you... Just tell me.
Tell me the truth.

596
00:44:25,175 --> 00:44:26,385
I'll help you.
I'll help you figure it out.

597
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:29,138
- Just tell me the truth.
- Yeah. Tell her the truth.

598
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:31,055
Tell me for Maria. Tell me for Lisa.
Tell me for Frank, Jr.

599
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,932
- Tell her what you did.
- You shut up!

600
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:35,852
- Tell her.
- What happened?

601
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:37,104
Please, we'll figure it out,

602
00:44:37,187 --> 00:44:39,399
but if you kill him, you will never know.

603
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:46,696
No, no, no.

604
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:48,240
Frank!

605
00:44:49,283 --> 00:44:51,452
Listen to me. Frank!

606
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:55,580
You do this, and you are the monster
that they say you are. Do you hear me?

607
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:03,213
You do this, and I am done.
That's it. You're dead to me.

608
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:04,506
Do you hear me?

609
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,470
I'm already dead.

610
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:30,031
It's like a candy store in here.

611
00:45:31,115 --> 00:45:32,242
Go ahead.

612
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,828
Go ahead.

613
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:39,334
I had to teach you how to hold a gun.
You remember?

614
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:43,713
Eighteen, and you'd
never held a piece before.

615
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:49,760
Come on. They call you "the Punisher."
Prove it.

616
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,597
Prove you don't need me anymore.

617
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:56,559
One shot...

618
00:45:57,892 --> 00:45:59,019
one kill.

619
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:03,399
You taught me that.

620
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:05,693
You stupid son of a...

621
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:43,147
Come on. Come on.

622
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,452
Still want to kill me?

623
00:46:56,535 --> 00:46:58,620
Yeah.

624
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:00,955
But he'd be pissed.

625
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:08,254
I just saved your ass...
and you're worried about what he thinks?

626
00:47:09,131 --> 00:47:11,633
Matt didn't come to rescue me.

627
00:47:11,716 --> 00:47:13,010
He came to save you.

628
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:14,761
I don't need to be saved.

629
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:16,763
From yourself, girl.

630
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:23,937
He knew that killing me
would've been your point of no return,

631
00:47:24,604 --> 00:47:26,106
so he stopped you.

632
00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:29,651
He thinks you're worth saving.

633
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:34,823
Earn that.

634
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:54,504
It will be ours.
You cannot stop what we've started.

635
00:49:55,214 --> 00:49:56,673
Watch me.

636
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:49,100
Daredevil must die.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
