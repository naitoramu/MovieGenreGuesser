1
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,521
I'm looking for people
who don't have much to lose.

2
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,521
I don't want any names
or personal questions.

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:13,201
nor, of course,
personal relationships.

4
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:16,241
Tomorrow's the robbery,
that's why I want to give you something.

5
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:17,881
Now you know my real name.

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,281
Profesor. Miss Tokio?

7
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,641
What are we going to steal?

8
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:22,921
The Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

9
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,001
Now. Stop!

10
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,441
Have you seen where we are, Dad?
We are very big.

11
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,361
- We're small.
Do you know how to do something?

12
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:40,641
Have you submitted your résumé anywhere?

13
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,521
- The résumé for what,
to get you out of Alcalá Meco?

14
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:45,641
- Because I'm not very smart, son.
And neither are you.

15
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:48,561
But in this blow
the brain comes from another.

16
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,961
And if we're lucky and you
don't do the asshole much,

17
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:53,601
you'll come out with your life solved.
- Stop being an asshole.

18
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:56,801
Be very careful, because the moment
there's a drop of blood,

19
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,361
we'll stop being Robin Hoods.

20
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:00,481
to turn into bastards.

21
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:03,161
What has happened?
- Confirmed: 35 employees,

22
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:04,481
11 security guards

23
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:06,441
and 17 kids from the British College.

24
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,881
It's essential that the police have no idea

25
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,281
of what we're doing.

26
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,081
What do they want? Time.

27
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,841
Time is money. Lots of money.

28
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,961
Every hour we printed 8 million euros.

29
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,081
I'm pregnant and you stay so calm.

30
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:21,481
And what do you want me to do?
I've been having sterile relationships

31
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,841
with my wife for 20 years,
and now you come to tell me this.

32
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,041
We're locked up and we don't
know how long this can last.

33
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:32,801
Let's assign some chores
so they don't get depressed.

34
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:35,801
- It's 48 meters down to the collector.

35
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,561
Shifts will be three hours.

36
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:41,361
They're digging a tunnel and they've
got a lot of plastic explosives.

37
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,801
and gas cans.

38
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:43,921
Put that down.

39
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,401
I love you, Mónica. And I want you
to continue with your pregnancy.

40
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,041
I have a cell phone in my office,

41
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,521
in the coat. I'll go.

42
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:51,441
Sit down!

43
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,201
- Come out.

44
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:58,321
- A judge has taken away your
custody and now I'll take care of you.

45
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:01,001
- It was you who didn't want her
to come to my birthday.

46
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,321
- I have a gift for the girl,
I'm at the door.

47
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,441
- You have a restraining order, get out.

48
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:08,521
- Her ex-husband has rebuilt her life,
personally and professionally,

49
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,721
but some women don't always turn the page.

50
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,121
- Thank you for your sensitivity, Colonel.

51
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,721
- I also have a request.

52
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,161
I would like to go online
and delete a photo.

53
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,401
- You can record a message,
we will send it.

54
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:22,401
- A phone has been turned on.
- Hack it.

55
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,521
- I'm in.

56
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,081
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No, no, no!

57
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:27,721
- It has been disconnected.
- Rewind.

58
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,881
Duplicate pixels.
- We've got it.

59
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,961
- We have the identity
of another of the robbers.

60
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:37,401
- Where's your tape recorder?

61
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,201
But what... What the fuck are you from?

62
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,361
I'm not a journalist.
My name is Salvador Martín.

63
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,881
I know him, he comes every day.

64
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,761
- I got footage from in there.

65
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,561
I have the identity of one of you.

66
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:50,001
You missed a phone,
find it or we're screwed.

67
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,561
I got distracted and saw
that Alison was trying to erase

68
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:53,681
the fucking picture, that's it.

69
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,161
- Love isn't the same as a couple of shags.

70
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:04,681
Are you trying to leave me?

71
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:10,001
If someone lays a hand on him,
I swear to God

72
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:14,081
that the next shot will go against
Helsinki, against Berlín, against you.

73
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:17,041
Your love story has fucked up
your escape plan.

74
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,241
They've got you, and Río too.
The police know who you are.

75
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,561
You're on all the news.

76
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,881
I don't think abortion
is such a good idea.

77
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,801
- What are you doing, Denver?

78
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:32,241
What's going to happen to our authority

79
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:35,241
when she tells the others?
Kill her.

80
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,601
- She has collapsed, this is inhumane.

81
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:04,921
- They're gonna kill me,
and then they're gonna kill you.

82
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:07,761
You're already dead, anyway.

83
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,961
Fucking hell...

84
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,961
Fucking hell, man.

85
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,441
Come on, man, come on.

86
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:27,681
Get down on your knees. No...

87
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:30,241
Don't kill me.

88
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,561
Don't look at me.

89
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,361
Don't look at me.

90
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,601
Please don't. Don't look at my fucking face.

91
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,641
Don't look at my fucking face!

92
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,081
- Paula?

93
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,921
Paula, honey! Where are you?

94
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,521
Where have you been, Paula?

95
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,481
Paula, honey!

96
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:49,441
Paula...

97
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,521
"I don't live in Almazán anymore.
I live in Madrid."

98
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:01,441
"The bus down to the center is number 21."

99
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:03,921
"I have two daughters."

100
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,281
"The keys are in the entrance drawer."

101
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,561
"I live with Raquel."

102
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:09,241
"I have two daughters."

103
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,921
"Paula always gets away with it."

104
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,881
"Paula's father has a restraining order."

105
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,361
"Never let Paula go with her father."

106
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:44,601
Thank you.

107
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,321
Shut up, shut up.

108
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,601
Thank you. Shut up.

109
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:50,281
Tell them you killed me
and disposed of the body.

110
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,561
I'm hiding.
Where the fuck are you hiding?

111
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:56,281
In vault 2. I have the key and the fingerprint.
No one will enter.

112
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:57,681
Tell them you killed me.

113
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,081
There's not a fucking drop of blood, girl.

114
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:03,041
There's not a fucking drop of blood.
Shoot me here, come on.

115
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:05,241
Shoot me in the hand. Don't talk nonsense.

116
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:06,801
Fuck my life!

117
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,201
Shoot me in the shoulder.

118
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,921
The shoulder is very close to the lung.
I can't.

119
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,601
On the thigh, which bleeds a lot.
I've seen it.

120
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,961
They nailed an iron to my brother
and he was bleeding a lot. Let's go. Come on.

121
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:22,281
Bite my hand if you want.

122
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,641
What the hell was that?

123
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,921
Nairobi, all yours.
- What?

124
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,241
- What happened?

125
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,681
- Calm down! Fuck!

126
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,041
Calm down. A little bit of fortitude, pussy,

127
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,881
or else we won't get out alive.

128
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,041
We need to grow a pair

129
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,481
Two shots fired.

130
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:01,841
Do you lack aim or
do blondes make you nervous?

131
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,801
- If she grabs your knee
and begs you not to kill her,

132
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:06,401
is not easy.

133
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,401
Why didn't you kill her?

134
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,081
You're a fucking bastard.

135
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:16,321
You don't want to get blood on your hands,

136
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,281
but you stain mine.

137
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:21,921
- If you ever lay a hand on me again,
you're a dead man.

138
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:29,481
There's a coal quarry in the basement.
Throw her in.

139
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,641
Then you clean up the whole thing.

140
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:21,961
Yes, it is.

141
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,641
Profesor, the one-hour deadline
I gave you is over.

142
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,921
I need to know if you' re going to surrender.

143
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,641
What did you play as a child in the schoolyard?

144
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:41,841
Jumping rope, bounce, 'donkey'...

145
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:45,001
To the sissies, look. That's what I was good at.

146
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:48,361
Well, I used to play cops and crooks.
Does that sound familiar?

147
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,001
Some of us played cops and had to catch the others.

148
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:54,721
and when they caught you, they caught you,
but I don't remember a single child

149
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:58,441
in all that playground that surrendered
before he got caught.

150
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:02,921
Children in the schoolyard
don't play jail for 8 or 16 years.

151
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,681
You're right.

152
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:07,361
You're absolutely right.

153
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:10,441
That is why I have consulted with my colleagues.

154
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:14,681
We voted, and you know what?
That we are enthusiasts.

155
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:17,521
In the end we have decided to go
for zero years in prison.

156
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,441
"Hi, I'm Raquel. I can't answer you right now.

157
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:29,041
If it is urgent, leave a message after the tone.

158
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,801
There are many people suffering.

159
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:35,641
What do you intend to do?
Take paper and pen.

160
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,481
I need a three-axle truck,
with a trailer for 18 tons,

161
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,801
two more tankers, with propane gas to escort him.

162
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:46,921
and the ship Malaika flying the flag
of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

163
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,881
That sound familiar?
It's the one that was seized nine months ago.

164
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,361
with 2800 kilos of cocaine.

165
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:53,881
They have him moored at the military port of Ferrol.

166
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,441
It's going to be hard to get
the green light for your requests;

167
00:10:56,601 --> 00:11:00,481
for logistical, security reasons...

168
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,001
Imagine this:

169
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:09,761
a building collapses
and there are 67 people inside.

170
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:13,681
How many media do you think
would be given the green light to save

171
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,081
the lives of those innocents?
Inspector, let's be clear.

172
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,041
You only have two options.

173
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:21,361
One: punish us; two: save lives.

174
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,801
And I'm afraid the two can't go together.

175
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,161
"You have a new message."

176
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,281
- Mom, I just finished. I'm on my way.

177
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,921
"To return the call, press one."

178
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,601
I'll make you a promise.

179
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:43,361
If you give up punishing us,

180
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:46,001
I will deliver those 67 hostages
to you perfectly safe.

181
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,441
Once we get to international waters.

182
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,241
I assure you, it's not the first choice

183
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,361
I've come up with, I hate the sea,
the fish and the sand on the beach.

184
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:57,481
But life doesn't always leave
an easy escape route, does it?

185
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:06,881
I have a message from my daughter
this morning from this number.

186
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,721
I don't... I am the mother of Raquel Murillo.

187
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,401
And I can't locate her.

188
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:14,401
Excuse me, you don't have a cell phone charger?

189
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,721
Would you like to use mine?
Thank you.

190
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,281
Please, do you know where she is?
It's urgent.

191
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:26,481
Let's get that truck
and get them out of that mousetrap.

192
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:28,521
In open field we will have it easier.

193
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:31,241
We will prepare the vehicles with narcotic gas.

194
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,721
- They won't come out.
- How do you know?

195
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,881
They opened that vault,
but they didn't wanted the money.

196
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,721
They waited for the police.

197
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:43,801
They fired.

198
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,041
They dropped two casually open bags

199
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,521
scattering the bills down the street.

200
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,881
- And?
- They wanted to pretend to be cornered

201
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,721
to win two days of negotiation.

202
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,521
But they got in there deliberately.

203
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:59,001
With a Browning machine gun,
red overalls, masks and God knows.

204
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:04,201
- They activated the alarm two hours
after they got in there.

205
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:06,361
- When they had opened the vault.

206
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,961
They used the money as an alibi
for a common robbery,

207
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,081
but it wasn't casual.
- They entered when

208
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:13,081
- the ambassador's daughter was there.
- That's why that man

209
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,401
speaks without hesitation.
He's in control because he knows

210
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,481
that everything goes according to his plans.
- What better plan than to get out of there

211
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,481
with the 8 million from the vault?

212
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:26,121
- They are printing their own unmarked money.

213
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,521
It can't happen. I bring a call

214
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:36,921
for Inspector Murillo, for Raquel Murillo.

215
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:39,641
Good. It's urgent and it's personal.

216
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,521
It's urgent. Come in.

217
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:48,881
Thank you. Extend your arms.

218
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,681
Come with me.

219
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,201
There's a call coming into the repeater.

220
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:09,841
- Record it. Now.

221
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:12,401
- It's recording.

222
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,001
A civilian is approaching the control point,
he' s going with Almansa.

223
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,961
He's asking for the inspector,
a personal and urgent matter.

224
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,121
Excuse me, inspector,

225
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:24,121
but I've got your mother on the phone.

226
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:27,081
I guess she' d call you from my number. Sorry.

227
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:29,681
You see, I think there's something wrong
with your daughter.

228
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,041
Yes?
- Oh, dear.

229
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:46,721
- Mom, what's going on?
- Stop recording.

230
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,721
- Paula went to lunch with her father.
- What?

231
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,281
- She told me it would only be a while.
- Mom, what have you done?

232
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,441
- She's not back yet.

233
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:54,481
- Alberto has a restraining order.

234
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:57,801
He can only see Paula every 15 days
and can't get in the house.

235
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,801
- I know, dear.
- Stop recording, damn it!

236
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,721
- It can't be done.
- Then turn it down!

237
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,361
- Mom, mom.

238
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,841
How long have they been gone?
- Two hours, I think.

239
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,721
- Okay, wait for me there.

240
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:21,721
What a mess you' re having, huh?

241
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,481
Almansa, escort the gentleman, please.

242
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:32,081
"Hidden behind a metallic voice with
its cameras and its strategy

243
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,521
negotiating the heist,
the Profesor felt like a fish in the water.

244
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:38,881
With all the other things in life, he was a real alien.

245
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,921
As different as Clark Kent and Superman.

246
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,881
Maybe it was because he had spent
his childhood and youth

247
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,281
bedridden at the San Juan de Dios Hospital
in San Sebastián

248
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,161
talking only to veteran nurses

249
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,361
and reading books.

250
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,761
He was neither very normal nor very social.

251
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,001
Much less a seducer."

252
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,481
May I sit down?

253
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:05,601
Sure.

254
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,241
"So I loved to make him nervous."

255
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,921
Hey, you, when you don't plan a hit,
what do you do?

256
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:17,801
You mean in my spare time or something?

257
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,121
Are you going to dance or...?

258
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:22,121
No, I don't. I don't have the slightest
sense of rhythm.

259
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:25,121
Do you have a girlfriend?

260
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,281
Wife?

261
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,921
We said no personal information.

262
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,121
You're not a virgin?

263
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,961
I've had relationships.

264
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,161
Several.

265
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:44,801
They haven't been many and they haven't
lasted either, but I have.

266
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,881
Relationships... Well then...

267
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:48,961
Sporadic.

268
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:51,001
Sporadic, I don't mean prostitutes,

269
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:52,161
don't get me wrong.

270
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:55,841
Well, I don't know, maybe you're gay.

271
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,681
For God's sake... No.

272
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,321
No, it did not come to me.

273
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:02,041
I'm not in any closet or anything like that.

274
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:15,761
People find a lot of things sexy.

275
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:19,801
Dancing, muscles, blond hair,

276
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,121
the French accent...

277
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,121
You know what I think is sexy?

278
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:30,881
Intelligence.

279
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,561
The men who talk to you and you
can't help but admire them.

280
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:38,121
It doesn't matter if they are tall,
short, ugly, handsome...

281
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,801
It makes me so horny that they talk
to me about things I don't know...

282
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,561
Well, who has that particularity
is recorded in the dictionary,

283
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,121
is called sapiophile.

284
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,641
You know everything, huh?

285
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:03,561
Look, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna watch the launching.

286
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:06,161
One thing.

287
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,121
How did you come up with this hit?

288
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:16,241
It didn't occur to me.

289
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:18,761
And who came up with it?

290
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:20,721
It didn't occur to me.

291
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:26,001
Well, that sapiophile thing sounds to me
like fucking a 'sapo' (toad).

292
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:39,601
- It's here, isn't it?
- Yes, wait.

293
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,601
Careful, careful, careful.

294
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:49,281
- Why don't it go?
- I have blood on my finger.

295
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,521
This one doesn't have a delayed
opening like the other one.

296
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:52,801
No.

297
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:59,921
Okay. Let's go.

298
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:25,481
The shots you heard came from
a run-in with the police.

299
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:31,241
It's been provoked by a hostage
who didn't meet my standards.

300
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,841
and has tried to contact...

301
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:35,961
with this phone.

302
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,201
And I wonder...

303
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:59,121
If I have Miss Gaztambide's telephone,

304
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:02,041
whose will this be?

305
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:06,521
Does anyone know about this little music?

306
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,481
What happened?

307
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,161
What are you doing?

308
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:16,881
We've all heard the shots.

309
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,201
I asked you what the hell happened.

310
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,441
Not here.

311
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,961
We said no victims.

312
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:27,041
She had a phone.
What did you want me to do, spank her?

313
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,361
Scare her, not kill her. Cut her off an ear,

314
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,641
as in the movies.
- If she had given information

315
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,521
to the police of how many and where we are,

316
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:35,521
now you'd be the one with the shot.

317
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,601
But you'd keep your ear.

318
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:39,641
Who fired?

319
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:42,001
Denver.

320
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,241
Too much hot blood.

321
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:48,601
- The Profesor said we weren't going to spill blood,

322
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,481
those were the rules.
- Well, a change has just taken place

323
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,481
regarding hostage control.

324
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,321
Okay?

325
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:59,201
Don't be nervous, public opinion

326
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,201
is on our side and that's not going to change.

327
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,401
When they realize there's a hostage missing,
we won't be here anymore.

328
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,081
We'll be far away.

329
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,121
Does the Profesor know that? Huh?

330
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:09,881
Does the Profesor know that you've skipped

331
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,721
- the first fucking rule of the plan?
- Are you going to talk to me about rules?

332
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:18,041
You, who for shagging that idiot
almost shot a cop?

333
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:20,161
- You have to call the Profesor and tell him.

334
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:24,001
- Little boy.

335
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:31,601
You call him Río.

336
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:45,161
He doesn't take it.

337
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,881
You can't be alert and controlling
everything 24 hours a day.

338
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,441
You have to eat, sleep, visit the toilet.

339
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:01,721
That's why in here I'm in charge.

340
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,841
We'll only get out of here
if we're professionals.

341
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:07,641
What the hell's going on here?

342
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,481
You could be heard from the outside.

343
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:12,481
Berlín has had a hostage executed.

344
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,001
Who was it?

345
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:28,761
Your son.

346
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:40,241
"The thief is by definition
an incorrigible optimist.

347
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:44,201
He always thinks everything's
gonna be all right,

348
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:47,041
but the first to be aware of all
this was about was Moscú.

349
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:54,441
He was one of those men who went straight ahead,

350
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:58,721
who give you confidence,
take care of you and tell you bad jokes.

351
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,881
He gave me tenderness."

352
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,921
What are you listening to?

353
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,801
Musicote.

354
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,881
Do you know how music was invented?

355
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,561
- No.
- Well, on a train.

356
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:22,161
There was a father and his son,
whose name was Pachín.

357
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:24,281
And the boy was very worried that the train

358
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:27,561
was going to stop in his village or not.
Besides, the child was very tiresome.

359
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:29,841
And he was all, like,
"Did this will stop, Dad?"

360
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,161
"Yes, it will stop, Pachín". "Did this
will stop, Dad?" "Yes, it will stop, Pachín".

361
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,721
"Parapapá, parapachín...".

362
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:40,201
What about you and Denver?

363
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:43,521
Family and artistic couple in the raids?

364
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:49,881
Yes, like the Dúo Sacapuntas,
but in burglaries.

365
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:53,481
"That evening Moscú told me
how he had dragged his son

366
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:55,601
to that madness of hold-up."

367
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:59,841
My son wouldn't have to be here.
But when the Profesor

368
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:03,201
proposed the plan to me,
I dragged him along with me.

369
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:19,601
- Oh.

370
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,001
There.

371
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:23,241
- Give me a fucking hug.

372
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:29,321
Hey, you don't disgust the food
in the gaol too much, do you?

373
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:31,881
- What the fuck, these are gases.

374
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,281
- Gases, yes.

375
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:36,001
- And the saturated fats they feed you in there.

376
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,521
- Yeah.
- Give me a cigarette, come on.

377
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:39,321
- I've got it ready. Here.

378
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:43,441
- How about you? How's life?

379
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:45,481
- Well then. Here we are.

380
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,721
- What's the matter with you?
- What's going to happen to me?

381
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:56,641
- The thrill of seeing you, Dad.
- Stop breaking my balls.

382
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,601
This is the sixth time
you've come to pick me up

383
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,401
and you've never brought that face.

384
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,801
What the hell is going on?

385
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:06,841
- Well, I screwed up.

386
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:09,401
- What the hell did you do?

387
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,041
I had lost 800 pills.

388
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:16,681
From some Polaco,
a fucking dealer from Alcorcón.

389
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:20,921
Apparently she had been lifted from her car.

390
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,921
- And he has a boss.

391
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,921
The twisted son of a bitch.

392
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:30,881
And then they start to break your nostrils,
leaving you crippled...

393
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,521
Let it be seen forever
that you've lifted the drug

394
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:34,761
to whom you didn't have to.

395
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:43,001
Dad, the deadline is going to end
and I don't have the money.

396
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:46,041
I swear to God I don't have it,
they picked it up from the car,

397
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,401
I didn't sell it or anything.
I didn't even take it, Dad,

398
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,041
I feel very bad about drugs.

399
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:01,921
- The bastard says he doesn't
do drugs anymore.

400
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:07,321
Maybe it's just that he's gotten sick or nauseous.

401
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:10,881
But he's a good kid, you know?

402
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:14,761
And he's got a heart that big.

403
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:23,281
To get his meniscus broken
with a baseball bat, you said:

404
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,921
"I'll put him to print bills."

405
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:28,441
He has already done all the bad jobs for me:

406
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:31,361
fur shops, savings banks, wagons...

407
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:36,121
And now it's a big one.

408
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,761
And if I get it right, I'm gonna take my son to a country

409
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:42,201
where we don't even know how to pronounce the name.

410
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,721
No Polacks, no pending lawsuits,
a fresh start.

411
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:49,361
But with my mojito and my beach.

412
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:52,161
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- What do you sorry?

413
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:54,361
Boy, can't you see the floor's scrubbed?

414
00:27:54,521 --> 00:27:57,081
- It's just that I left my notes to study, Dad.

415
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,481
- You left your notes... Then get out now.

416
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,641
- Don't be annoying.

417
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,961
- You want to leave...
- Dad, I have to study

418
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:07,041
and I left my notes. I'm coming.
- Get out now, come on.

419
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:10,001
Come on, damn it. Come on, run.

420
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:17,961
- Oh, oh!

421
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,841
You stop.

422
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:26,681
For the last time, return to your position.

423
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,001
What are you going to do?

424
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:38,241
Shoot me?

425
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:41,961
And then who?

426
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,521
All of them?

427
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:46,641
Are you going to stay alone in this mousetrap?

428
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,241
Son.

429
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:24,401
Did you kill that woman?

430
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,761
- Oh, Dad.

431
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,321
- Not a thing.

432
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,001
- I can't breathe.
- Dad.

433
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,401
Dad, what's wrong? What's wrong?

434
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,841
Dad, is it a heart attack?

435
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,401
Are you having a heart attack?
Dad, no, no, no.

436
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,601
It's an anxiety attack.
Lie him down.

437
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:00,161
Lie him down. Lie him down.
Dad, dad, dad.

438
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:03,481
"Thrown on that floor full of blood,

439
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:05,921
Moscú knew there would be no caipirinhas.

440
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:08,601
Nor any country that they did
not know how to pronounce.

441
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:12,681
That he hadn't taken Denver there
to save him from anything,

442
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:15,721
but to sink him in a hole from
which he would only get out jailed.

443
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,721
Or with a shot in the chest."

444
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,041
This is going to take time,
but it's neither the first

445
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:24,921
nor the last time. Okay?

446
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:27,721
We're all tired, but we have
to keep one's composure.

447
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:29,681
- Attention, incoming signal.

448
00:30:29,841 --> 00:30:32,361
Attention, everyone to your posts.
A signal has entered.

449
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:35,241
- It' s a cell phone.
It has been connected inside the factory.

450
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,601
- Whose number is it?
- From Mercedes Colmenar,

451
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:39,401
the professor at Brighton College.

452
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:41,241
- Get into the cameras on that phone.

453
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:42,681
- Accessing selfie camera.

454
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,641
- Black. It has been condemned.
- Then go to the main one.

455
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,801
- Blinded too. They are sending a video.

456
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:55,521
- Who's the recipient?
Come on

457
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:57,881
- I'm downloading it to the main screen.

458
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,521
- Hi, honey. How are you?

459
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:04,801
- It's being sent to the teacher's boyfriend.

460
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:06,161
And another a recipient.

461
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:08,401
- He's leaking it mainstream.

462
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:11,561
- Yes, it's an email from Onda Cero.
- They have let record a video and...

463
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:15,481
It's just to tell you we're okay.

464
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,281
- Yes, I'm seeing it.
- What... Nothing, I'm...

465
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,321
- Contact the editorial office of Onda Cero.

466
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:23,321
We must prevent the broadcast of the video.

467
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:27,161
- Honestly, the kids are taking it as a joke.

468
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:29,121
- All right.

469
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,881
- What was her name again?
- Mercedes Colmenar.

470
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,401
- Mercedes Colmenar.

471
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,281
And you, Aitor, look,
I know I've spent many nights

472
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:42,881
marking exams and talking to you about...

473
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:47,161
I don't know, of fractious boys,

474
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:49,761
instead of us.

475
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,641
So I promise you, when I get out of here.

476
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:55,801
I'm not going to take work home.

477
00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:01,521
And that I'm going to be more... You know.

478
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:05,841
Crazy stuff.
Like that one in Salamanca, remember?

479
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:09,801
Wait for me, okay?

480
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:16,401
This will be brief, you'll see.

481
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:21,721
"Denver's gunfire
had broken the fragile balance

482
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:22,841
of the hostages.

483
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:25,841
The Profesor had understood that
they were in a kidnapping

484
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,881
that left dead on the way.

485
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,841
And for all the efforts
Nairobi made to encourage

486
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:35,121
the gloomy atmosphere,
fear fell by its own weight.

487
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:39,081
And among them all,
a quiet man was chewing on his guilt.

488
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:42,841
Suspecting that the shots
had been fired at his pregnant lover."

489
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:46,121
The shots we've heard before,
have they hurt anyone?

490
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,401
Calm down, okay?

491
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,081
No one's been hurt. Okay?

492
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:54,321
We fired to dissuade an intervention.
That's all.

493
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:55,841
Thank you. Thank you.

494
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:58,801
- You have heard it.
No more thinking strange things

495
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:02,241
about those shots, okay?
Those men are thieves,

496
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:05,521
they're not from the Jihad
or anything like that.

497
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:07,801
Let's tell each other how we feel.

498
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:09,641
- I heard your name is Río.

499
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:14,081
I also heard from your buddies
that the police have a picture of you

500
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:15,681
because of me.

501
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,361
I wanted to apologize.

502
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:21,801
When I turned on my cell phone,
I didn't want to expose you or anything.

503
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:24,241
And I didn't realize
how dangerous it was for you either.

504
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:26,081
what nonsense it was to me.

505
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:27,961
The tit thing, I mean.

506
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:30,801
- Well, according to the tit, right?

507
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:34,401
- Well... Thank you.

508
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,921
But I already knew the risks
I took breaking in here to steal.

509
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:40,521
That's what this world has, isn't it?

510
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:42,761
You know if you get caught, you end up in jail.

511
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,041
Or worse yet, a bullet.

512
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,321
The playtime bell rang
and I didn't even know, hey.

513
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,081
Bring the rice.

514
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:14,201
Oh, Mom.
- I'm sorry, honey.

515
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:31,801
- Mommy.

516
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:33,841
We've been to the amusement park.

517
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,921
It's really cool.
- Sure, honey.

518
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:41,641
Mom, can you go upstairs a
nd leave the teddy in the room?

519
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:42,961
- Of course, daughter.

520
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,841
- Come on, little girl.

521
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:56,561
I just took her to the amusement park.

522
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,001
It was my birthday present.

523
00:34:59,321 --> 00:35:01,641
- You've broken a restraining order.

524
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,641
Turn around and stand against the wall.

525
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,041
- Raquel, I'm her father.

526
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:06,481
You can't keep me away from Paula.

527
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,561
- You disobeyed a restraining order.

528
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,481
Turn around and stand against the wall.

529
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,681
- You've already fucked up my life.
Isn't that enough for you?

530
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,841
- I said put you...!
- What are you doing?

531
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:17,641
Is that so?

532
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:20,001
Are you going to point the gun at me?

533
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,841
- Hello?

534
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:54,561
Raquel, it's Salva.
I'm calling from the cafeteria.

535
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:57,481
It's an emergency, you took my cell phone.

536
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:59,321
Raquel?

537
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,161
Hi.

538
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,521
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm a mess.

539
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:10,281
No, don't worry, really.
I don't think anyone called me.

540
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:13,201
Let's see. Look, not a sad wasap. See?

541
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:15,241
So no...

542
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:19,601
Excuse me, it's none of my business at all,

543
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,641
but is everything okay with your daughter?

544
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:28,881
I stole your cell phone,
I frisked you, I almost arrested you,

545
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,001
and you still care about me?

546
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,041
Let's see, you took the cell phone accidentally.

547
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,241
It's been the nervous moments and all.

548
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:41,761
And the frisking, well... Well, it was fun.

549
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:43,921
What do you want me to say, it was exciting.

550
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:46,401
"The recorder. Where's the recorder?"

551
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,601
And me with the arm here. I'm sorry.

552
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:51,041
Antonio was petrified.

553
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:54,841
But then he invited me to something.
So, we are even.

554
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,601
Everything's fine, thank you.

555
00:36:57,761 --> 00:36:58,721
Okay.

556
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:04,481
Ah... Can I ask for your
mobile phone for a moment?

557
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:09,081
Are you serious?

558
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:11,241
- Sure. You won't frisk me again?
- No, no.

559
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,041
- You sure about that?
- Really.

560
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:21,401
Ángel, it's Raquel.

561
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:24,401
I'm here in the cafeteria.
Everything okay there?

562
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,761
Can I have time to eat a sandwich?
- They've opened several phones.

563
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:29,681
- How? I'm on my way.

564
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,641
- No, no, don't come.

565
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:34,161
- Vegetable.
- They have only sent a few videos

566
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:37,121
from the hostages to the relatives.
- Wine?

567
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:38,961
They've also been leaked by the media.

568
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:40,081
- Fucking hell.

569
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:43,361
Did you hack into the phones?
- Nothing. They've covered the cameras.

570
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:48,281
- Well, anything I'm here in the cafeteria.

571
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:51,681
Call me at this number.
- Yes, yes.

572
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:53,561
I left my cell phone in the tent.

573
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:54,761
- Okay.

574
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:59,681
Hey, do me a favor, eat something
other than a sandwich, okay?

575
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:01,281
Okay.

576
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:03,761
- Thank you.
- All right, then.

577
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,761
Everything all right?

578
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:09,441
Okay.

579
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,081
I'm glad to hear it.
In the end you worry about a lot of things

580
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,321
and we shouldn't give so much importance to things.

581
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:18,401
Nothing's really right.

582
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:21,641
Everything, everything's pretty bad.

583
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,601
Worse.

584
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,601
Fuckin' awful, I'd say.

585
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,441
Sorry, but no...

586
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:38,081
No, the urgency was that my ex-husband
had taken my daughter and...

587
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:42,201
Well, he's got a restraining order
for mistreatment.

588
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,401
Thank you.

589
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:51,561
Thank you.

590
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,281
Dad, dad.

591
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,881
How are you feeling?

592
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:04,801
- I'm cold.
- Cold?

593
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:05,961
- Yes.

594
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,681
- Get a blanket.
- Yes, I am going.

595
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:11,121
- And some sugar, whatever.
- Come on, move, get some sugar.

596
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:14,441
- I don't know what happened to me.

597
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:19,361
I guess I've been digging t
he tunnel all morning.

598
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:22,721
And I've only had one of
those fucking sandwiches.

599
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:25,401
- Now let's get some rest, Dad. Rest.

600
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,681
Do you know what's good for you now?

601
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:37,121
A good stew like those you like, huh?

602
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:40,161
With his chickpeas and his pork.
- That's it, the blanket, come on.

603
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,641
Right there. That's it, Moscú.
- Thank you.

604
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:45,801
- Look, four little corners has my bed

605
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,441
and four little angels who keep it for me.

606
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:50,121
- You just relax now, okay?

607
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:10,121
- What are you doing here, Dad?

608
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:11,881
Come on...

609
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:15,921
At four in the morning I wake up
and you're not in bed.

610
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:21,481
- Nothing, damn it, I couldn't sleep and
I went out to see the sky for a while.

611
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,921
- The sky.

612
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:27,521
It's a big sky, isn't it?

613
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:28,921
Where will all that end?

614
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:34,361
What's going on? What's going on?
- Nothing.

615
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:37,881
- Do you know why I left the mine?

616
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,681
- Of course I know.

617
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:41,881
Because of the shit that ate your lungs.

618
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,561
The "symphilis."
- Not syphilis.

619
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,601
- What's going on?
- You're so fucking brute.

620
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:48,201
Silicosis.
- I told you.

621
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:50,561
- But that's not why.

622
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:52,841
It's because I was claustrophobic.

623
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:54,201
- You?
- Yes.

624
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:58,641
I couldn't stand being stuck in that hole.

625
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:06,481
And then I went to burglary to get out of that hole.

626
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:09,081
And I ended up in the gaol.

627
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:10,961
Locked up, same as my whole fucking life.

628
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:15,761
- Are you all right, Dad? You look weird.

629
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:17,521
- Not weird.

630
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:24,161
I'm fucking great, here, in the country,
and outdoors.

631
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:32,801
I am not fit to be overwhelmed.

632
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:34,841
- But we're fucking great, Dad.
- Yeah.

633
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:37,201
- And we better be when we get out of here.

634
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,241
You know what I'm saying?

635
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:41,681
Fuck the Maserati and the gyms.

636
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:44,161
You know what we are going to do
with the millions?

637
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:47,401
We're going to buy an island.

638
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:50,801
So you can sleep naked in the middle
of the palm trees.

639
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,921
In a hut. A hut for you and another for me.

640
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:54,761
- Yes.
- No sleeping together like here,

641
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:58,161
that you snore a lot.
- What do you say? I don't snore, kid.

642
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:01,441
- Dad, you snore awfully, I said it.

643
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:03,441
- Snoring?
- You snore a lot.

644
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:06,241
- I don't snore.
- You sound like a trombone, Dad.

645
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,641
Put this in.

646
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:13,001
Let's go, huh?

647
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:14,961
Right there.

648
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:20,001
Let's let him rest.

649
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:24,521
You finish cleaning the bathroom.

650
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,321
And then you switch to Helsinki
to keep an eye on the hostages.

651
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:12,681
I've brought things to cure you.

652
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,841
Does it hurts a lot?
- A little bit.

653
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,121
We're gonna make that tourniquet right, okay?

654
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:19,801
Okay.

655
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:21,081
Let's see.

656
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:22,201
Let's see.

657
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:26,801
Aah!

658
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:29,561
I think it should be removed.

659
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,921
Yeah. Okay.

660
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:33,761
Can I help you?

661
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:42,841
Slowly.

662
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:45,441
Aah!

663
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:47,361
Come on, that's it, that's it.

664
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:49,841
Okay, okay, okay.

665
00:43:51,401 --> 00:43:53,321
Aah!

666
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:55,721
Fucking hell.

667
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,121
Okay.

668
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,841
Ah... Okay, that's it, that's it.

669
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:10,681
Ah.

670
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:12,041
Oh, my God.

671
00:44:19,721 --> 00:44:23,601
You guys don't have to talk
to the kidnappers at all.

672
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:24,961
Is that clear?

673
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,001
We have said that they are not of the Jihad,
but you have to understand

674
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:29,801
that they are under great stress.

675
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:33,321
Alison. Alison, please,
I'm talking about you.

676
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:36,201
I don't want you talking
to any kidnappers again.

677
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:38,841
Is that clear?
- I just wanted to apologize.

678
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:40,641
I think he's been booked because of me.

679
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:44,241
He was recorded on my cell phone.

680
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:46,721
Because I wanted to turn it on
to get on the Internet.

681
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:49,321
- You turned on your cell phone
to get on the Internet?

682
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:51,801
- I wanted to delete a photo...
- Will you shut up now?

683
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:53,761
- No, no, let's talk about it.

684
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:55,921
Now, tell me, what about that picture?

685
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:57,601
- One that Pablo made me.

686
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,961
She cheated on me and took a picture of me naked.

687
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,241
And he uploaded it to my profile.

688
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,921
- Pablo, what you have done to your partner

689
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:08,761
seems to me to be in very bad taste
and I think you should apologize to her.

690
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:11,521
in front of all your companions.
- I don't give a fuck about the picture.

691
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:13,921
I don't care. Are we crazy?

692
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:16,321
- We could be here or anywhere else.

693
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:20,481
What I'm not gonna allow is
any lack of respect, okay?

694
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:21,961
Neither between you nor with me.

695
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:24,081
So apologize to your partner.

696
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:26,281
- What?
- That you ask her for forgiveness.

697
00:45:28,881 --> 00:45:31,521
- Was it gonna be a joke of what? Two seconds?

698
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,601
Until you deleted the photo?

699
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:36,441
But then they came and fucked it all up.

700
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:40,121
I'm sorry, Alison.

701
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:43,321
But it wasn't my idea alone, was it?

702
00:45:45,881 --> 00:45:47,481
- I'm sorry.

703
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:51,321
- I'm sorry, girl.

704
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:54,521
It's out of our hands.

705
00:45:54,681 --> 00:45:56,521
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

706
00:45:56,681 --> 00:45:59,241
- And I, dude, really.
- It's gotten out of hand, dude.

707
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:01,841
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

708
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:14,361
- I think we should take out the bullet.

709
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:19,121
No, no, no. No,
there are muscles, bones and everything.

710
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,561
Maybe we're gonna mess it up.
- I'm going to do it carefully.

711
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,801
How are you gonna get it out?
- Take out the bullet and...

712
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:26,881
You can't take it out with that.
- Better to take it out than leave it inside.

713
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,281
Not at all. Some people have bullets
and nothing happens.

714
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:32,401
I've seen it on TV.
And pieces of glass. It's all right.

715
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:34,881
Okay, okay, okay.
- We'll leave it.

716
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:38,601
We cover the bleeding and we see how you evolve, okay?

717
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,001
Yeah.
- Don't worry.

718
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:46,921
Okay, okay.

719
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,801
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:53,161
That's it, that's it, that's it.

721
00:46:53,321 --> 00:46:55,081
That's it. That's it.

722
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,241
Okay.

723
00:47:05,401 --> 00:47:10,161
This is like when we used to play
the operating bug when we were little...

724
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,001
Okay.

725
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:18,481
I brought antibiotics for a wedding.

726
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:21,441
Soothing, muscle relaxants... Everything.

727
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:23,561
Won't that be bad? Huh?

728
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:26,561
See if he's gonna have
contraindications or something.

729
00:48:26,721 --> 00:48:30,121
Well, more contraindications
than a bullet I don't know, huh?

730
00:48:33,361 --> 00:48:35,441
I was saying that about the baby.

731
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:38,921
It's true.

732
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,241
Okay, okay.

733
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:45,441
I read the leaflet and see what we do, huh?

734
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,281
Let's see.

735
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:57,081
"Read the entire package leaflet
before you start taking the medication.

736
00:48:57,241 --> 00:48:58,601
Keep this leaflet,

737
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,601
since you may have to read it again.

738
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:06,521
If in doubt, consult your doctor or pharmacist.

739
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:08,841
This medicine has been prescribed to you..."

740
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,241
Okay.

741
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:26,281
- No.

742
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:36,201
Hey! Do you have any more noodles?

743
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:43,921
- Noodles, no. I've got rice left.

744
00:50:45,361 --> 00:50:47,121
- It doesn't matter.

745
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:55,441
- Moscú

746
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:03,481
Moscú, what are you doing? Hey!

747
00:51:03,641 --> 00:51:06,361
What are you doing? What are you doing?

748
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,681
- Tokio, what's going on?

749
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:09,841
I don't know what's going on.

750
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:12,121
- Moscú!

751
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:17,401
- They're opening the doors.
- Attention, everyone.

752
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:20,201
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- In position.

753
00:51:22,321 --> 00:51:24,201
- Stop!

754
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,961
- Snipers.

755
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:27,921
- Alpha 1 in position.
- Alpha 2 in position.

756
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:30,161
- Alpha 3 in position.

757
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,761
Down on the ground!
Everybody down on the ground!

758
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:34,681
On the ground! Now!

759
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:37,321
- I've got a shot at him.

760
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:39,161
Three, two, one.

761
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:41,601
- Cover your face! Cover your face!
- Let me out.

762
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:43,601
- They're not wearing a mask.
- They are struggling.

763
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:45,361
- No.
- I have to go out.

764
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:47,561
- Record it.
- I don't see their faces.

765
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:49,921
- I've got to get out.
- Go out for what?

766
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:52,001
- Sir, I've got a shot at them.

767
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:55,881
- It's my fault.
You didn't have to kill anyone.

768
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:58,481
- I've got them in range, sir.

769
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:02,841
- Let me out of here.
- You wanted to get in

770
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:07,401
to take my rap.
- We don't know if the robbers...

771
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:11,241
- Let me out of here.
- I didn't kill her.

772
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:14,841
- Let me out of here.
- I didn't kill her.

773
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:17,081
I'm hiding it.

774
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:23,401
- The doors are closing, sir.
Three seconds.

775
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:25,641
- Nobody shoot.

776
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,441
- Fucking hell!

777
00:52:32,201 --> 00:52:33,961
- Let me out of here.

778
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:36,081
- Dad, we're going to go out into the open

779
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,641
so you can breathe fresh air.
- I need air.

780
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:48,481
I'm so sorry that you went through a...

781
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:54,521
For an experience like this...

782
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:59,801
Well, if you need any help that I can give you...

783
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:04,001
A phone always available,
a bodyguard with glasses...

784
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:08,401
I beg your pardon.
I shouldn't have joked about something like that.

785
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,041
I'm an asshole.
- Don't worry.

786
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:13,401
I beg your pardon.
I see you, and you don't fit me.

787
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:16,801
It's not what I imagine if I think of...

788
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:20,001
In what? In a battered woman?

789
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:24,961
Because I carry a gun, don't I?

790
00:53:26,921 --> 00:53:28,561
Look,

791
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:32,601
the fact is, it doesn't start with a slap.

792
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:37,241
If so, no one would be with a violent man.

793
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,921
On the contrary, it is...

794
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:43,441
You are...

795
00:53:43,601 --> 00:53:47,441
You fall in love with
a charming, intelligent man

796
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,881
that makes you feel
the center of the universe.

797
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:55,601
And when he asks you
to change your profile picture

798
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:58,761
and put your daughter's,
you find it tender.

799
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:03,721
And when he tells you not
to wear a miniskirt to work,

800
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:07,641
you think, "I'm a woman who works

801
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:12,121
in a man's world and
he's actually protecting me."

802
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:18,961
And then, one day, he raises his voice...

803
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:21,441
You don't have to tell me.
- Yeah, yeah.

804
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:23,721
I need to.

805
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:25,641
Look, it's like...

806
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:28,841
It's like descending steps slowly.

807
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:32,681
Like in those scary movies
where someone goes down to the basement

808
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:36,721
and everyone thinks,
"Don't go down there. Don't go down there.

809
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:39,561
But you go down.

810
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:43,281
And that's when he gave me the first slap.

811
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:47,441
And then the second and third...

812
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:51,161
And I finally got divorced.

813
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,921
You didn't denounce him?

814
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:01,201
No. He was a cop,

815
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:06,961
the most popular guy in the station
and I just wanted to let him out of my sight.

816
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:14,321
I guess I was embarrassed to sit in front of my boss

817
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:19,121
and recount to him a year
and a half of humiliations and blows.

818
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:23,561
I got a 9 mm HK in the pouch,

819
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:28,081
but I have no fucking idea
how to take care of myself.

820
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,161
Don't say that.

821
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:37,281
But the real drama came a few months later,

822
00:55:38,241 --> 00:55:41,401
because my sister fell in love with him.

823
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:50,201
They began to go out, to travel and...

824
00:55:51,401 --> 00:55:53,161
And then I denounced him,

825
00:55:53,961 --> 00:55:56,121
late and with no evidence,

826
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:03,521
because I didn't want my sister
to be in that hell.

827
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:05,561
Do you understand?

828
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:11,481
But, of course, the only thing I got
was to look like a pathological jealous woman

829
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:13,521
making a false report.

830
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:17,561
And, 'Look, the Inspector doesn't report it in time.

831
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:20,521
and denounces it now that he' s with her sister'.

832
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:24,321
But, Raquel, the police or the judges

833
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,001
have to believe you,
it's impossible not to believe you.

834
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:30,481
Raquel, I've just felt the emotion and helplessness

835
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,201
of having someone to help you.

836
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:34,961
Somebody. Who's gonna help me?
- Me.

837
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,401
Forgive me, I don't know how I could help you,

838
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:41,521
but...

839
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:46,761
Thank you.

840
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:51,361
Raquel.

841
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:55,081
Raquel.
- Ángel.

842
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:56,641
- There's movement in the building.

843
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,361
They opened the door for a few seconds
and there's been a brawl.

844
00:56:59,521 --> 00:57:01,121
We think with a hostage.
- Let's go.

845
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:18,241
He wasn't a hostage.
- Why would you say that?

846
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:21,521
- Because, unless they're Gandhi's disciples,

847
00:57:21,681 --> 00:57:23,881
they would never let a hostage go this far

848
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,081
without shooting him in the back.
One of them wanted to surrender.

849
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:32,921
- Inspector Raquel Murillo?

850
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:36,081
- Now, I want you to know that this is not a threat,

851
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,401
but a favor I ask of you on a personal level,

852
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:39,721
not as a robber.

853
00:57:39,881 --> 00:57:42,681
I want you to put on the masks, the hoods.

854
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:45,841
and go out on the roof without
doing any signs or nonsense.

855
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:47,721
Just 10 minutes, okay?

856
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:51,161
Get out, get some air and get in, okay?

857
00:57:53,561 --> 00:57:56,441
What are you trying to do, entertain the police?

858
00:57:56,601 --> 00:57:58,241
The police are already entertained,

859
00:57:58,401 --> 00:58:00,961
so leave it alone and don't mess with my henhouse.

860
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:05,081
The bait. They want to use us as bait.

861
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:06,961
What's that? They send us to the lions

862
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,281
while they take advantage to go out the other side.

863
00:58:09,441 --> 00:58:11,801
We'll go out for humanity,

864
00:58:12,561 --> 00:58:14,921
because a colleague of ours needs to breathe,

865
00:58:15,081 --> 00:58:16,721
and I'm not gonna tell you again.

866
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:20,761
- Don't move.

867
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:25,921
- But what fucking world do we live in?

868
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:29,441
No one's willing to do anything
for anyone anymore, right?

869
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:31,681
A partner has an anxiety attack

870
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,801
and you do nothing but think of the bait.

871
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,481
Nothing's gonna happen.

872
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:39,761
Nothing's going to happen
because I'm going out with you.

873
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:42,121
Why did he have an anxiety attack?

874
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:44,841
Because of the shots.
It was the shooting, wasn't it?

875
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:47,201
It was the shooting. Who did you kill?

876
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:48,881
Who did you kill?

877
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:51,401
Open your mouth, Arturo.

878
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:55,881
Open your fucking mouth, Arturo.

879
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:57,441
Open your mouth.

880
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:01,001
Now raise your left hand

881
00:59:01,161 --> 00:59:03,281
if you're gonna keep breaking my balls.

882
00:59:03,441 --> 00:59:06,641
If you're gonna keep your mouth shut,
raise your right hand.

883
00:59:11,641 --> 00:59:13,081
Okay.

884
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,161
- Stop it, stop it.

885
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:17,161
Cut it out.

886
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:23,681
Stop doing the nerd, please.

887
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:34,361
Who was that?
- Interior.

888
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,681
That we accede to their requests or that we enter,

889
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:41,841
that this is going on too long.
It's on the news halfway around the world.

890
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:46,761
What's the guarantee of getting in there

891
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:49,361
and get everyone out alive?
- Ninety percent.

892
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:52,881
- If your daughter was there, would you come in?

893
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:54,321
- No, I'm not.

894
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:59,561
Look, they started all
this shooting from close range,

895
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,321
we can come in with gas or everything,

896
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:04,201
but that they raise their hands
and surrender is unlikely.

897
01:00:04,361 --> 01:00:05,561
- I know.

898
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:09,081
I'm not going to give an order that endangers

899
01:00:09,241 --> 01:00:10,721
the life of a child.
- I know.

900
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:15,361
- I'd need to go home
and take some antidepressants

901
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:18,161
and take care of mine,

902
01:00:19,361 --> 01:00:21,081
but I'm not going to resign

903
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:23,441
if while I'm in command I avoid funerals.

904
01:00:24,641 --> 01:00:26,321
Now, yes, Dad.

905
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:28,481
Get some air.

906
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,401
- You don't have to do this for me.

907
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:37,121
- I remember when Mom left,

908
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:39,961
it was hard for you to breathe,

909
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:43,681
that you went out on the balcony
to try to do it every night.

910
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,081
No matter who it is, you're going out there,

911
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:47,201
You're gonna get some air.

912
01:00:47,321 --> 01:00:49,201
and when you're calm, we go in.

913
01:00:49,361 --> 01:00:51,761
Everybody with the mask on and the hood.

914
01:00:51,921 --> 01:00:53,321
Arturito, near me.

915
01:01:05,201 --> 01:01:08,441
This is Cóndor 3 for command center.
Roof movement.

916
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:11,921
- Suárez, attentive snipers.

917
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,201
- They're a big group.
- All to position.

918
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:17,761
- Maximum attention, we have visual.
- They're advancing, they're advancing.

919
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:21,921
- Dad, calm down.
- Okay.

920
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:24,401
- Look what a fucking day it is.

921
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:26,561
- Yes.
- What a sun, huh?

922
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:28,401
You breathe and be calm.

923
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:31,161
- They're a big group.
They keep walking on the roof.

924
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,041
- They advance to the edge of the roof.

925
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:38,161
Yeah? What's going on?

926
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:41,441
Why are they on the roof?
- Moscú went out to breathe fresh air

927
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:43,761
flanked by hostages with fake weapons.

928
01:01:43,921 --> 01:01:47,041
As you well know, I would never
have allowed this madness,

929
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:49,961
but right now my companions
are convincing me

930
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:54,561
that it's a good idea.
- I don't want any more improvisations.

931
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:56,281
Keep me informed of everything.

932
01:01:56,441 --> 01:01:59,241
They're still walking. They are reaching
the edge of the building.

933
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:01,201
- If you don't start keeping a cool head,

934
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:03,641
forget the millions, the life in Acapulco

935
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:06,281
and the garden full of kids, because
you're going to fuck everything up.

936
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:10,201
There was only one thing you had
to do: be professionals.

937
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:15,041
- Doesn't this look professional to you?

938
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:17,201
Huh?

939
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:19,521
- Lovely.
- No, not precious.

940
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:23,121
A better fucking bill than
the one they give in the banks.

941
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:27,481
It can't even be traced. A work of art.

942
01:02:29,081 --> 01:02:32,121
And you know why?
- Enlighten me, Nairobi.

943
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:39,161
- Because it's made with love.

944
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,721
I'm a professional.

945
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:44,921
What I don't know is what to do

946
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:48,041
when your father gets crazy
in the middle of this mess,

947
01:02:48,201 --> 01:02:49,881
You're a thief before you're a son?

948
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,001
Huh, Berlín?

949
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:54,521
Before being human?

950
01:02:58,121 --> 01:03:00,641
For a shit like you, maybe so,

951
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:03,321
but I don't know.

952
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:13,321
You didn't kill that girl, did you?
- No.

953
01:03:13,481 --> 01:03:15,441
- Tell me the truth.
- No!

954
01:03:17,681 --> 01:03:19,561
Berlín caught her with a cell phone,

955
01:03:19,721 --> 01:03:22,041
ordered me to kill her and
I had to shoot her,

956
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:24,721
I couldn't do anything else.
- You're talking about Mónica.

957
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:26,401
You're talking about Mónica.

958
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:28,441
What are you doing? What are you doing?
- What have you done with Mónica?

959
01:03:28,601 --> 01:03:29,561
Go back to your place.

960
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:31,961
- This is not a courtesy call, Profesor.

961
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:33,881
If you want me not to withhold
information from you,

962
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:35,921
you should do the same with me.

963
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:38,841
Everyone has the right to stretch their legs.

964
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:41,201
Doesn't it seem supportive of me

965
01:03:41,361 --> 01:03:43,641
to let the hostages come out to breathe?

966
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:47,001
I assure you, I have no intention
of torturing or frightening them.

967
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:49,841
I just want to give them back
to you safe and sound

968
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:53,201
as soon as you give me what I asked for,

969
01:03:55,841 --> 01:03:57,281
nothing else.

970
01:03:57,441 --> 01:04:00,321
Repeat, they're armed,
all under cover in the operation.

971
01:04:01,161 --> 01:04:05,521
What the hell did you do with Mónica?
- Go back to your place.

972
01:04:05,681 --> 01:04:08,601
- There's something wrong.
- Request instructions.

973
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,881
You fucking killed Mónica.
She was innocent.

974
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:13,961
This is Cóndor 1. Target viewer.

975
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,161
- Request green light.

976
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:16,641
- Get on your knees.
- What?

977
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:19,321
She was pregnant.
- Snipers, for fuck's sake.

978
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,081
Let them think we're hostages.
Hands on your head.

979
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:24,881
Don't play games with me, get up.
I'm talking to you, dammit.

980
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:27,081
Something's going on.
- They're crouching.

981
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,761
- They've been kneeling to execute them.

982
01:04:29,921 --> 01:04:32,161
- There are snipers.

983
01:04:32,321 --> 01:04:34,401
On your knees, there are snipers.

984
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:36,481
- Everybody down.

985
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:42,321
- This is Cóndor 3.
There's a Dalí pointing at another.

986
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:46,601
- I'm seeing it clearly.
- I request instructions, sir.

987
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:49,121
- I need authorization.
- They are still kneeling.

988
01:04:49,281 --> 01:04:51,361
Waiting for instructions.
- Give me the green light.

989
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:54,121
- They're running.
- I'm shooting the kidnapper.

990
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:57,281
What the fuck are you doing?
- There are snipers, for fuck's sake.

991
01:04:57,441 --> 01:04:59,881
Get on your knees.
- They're fucking pointing.

992
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:02,001
- Give me the green light.
- They're going to execute you.

993
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:03,841
They intend to shoot.

994
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,681
- They're going to kill them.

995
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,521
- Green light.

996
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:10,641
- Cóndor 3, open fire.

997
01:05:24,481 --> 01:05:27,001
Target down, sir.
- White down.

998
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:28,361
White down.

999
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:29,521
We've got a visual.

1000
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:32,601
- He's the factory manager, Arturo Román.

1001
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:35,281
Hold your fire.
- Cóndor 3, cease fire.

1002
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:41,921
- We've got a hostage down.

1003
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,321
Aah!

1004
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:09,121
Where the hell is she?
- The motherfucker escaped.

1005
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:13,401
Good!

1006
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:16,961
They had it all figured out
except this one shot

1007
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:18,721
and we have to take advantage of it.

1008
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:22,441
Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:30,641
Come on in.

1010
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:34,601
Do you like tequila?

1011
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,401
Hearing. Active plan B.

1012
01:07:05,001 --> 01:07:06,321
Nobody's getting out of here.

1013
01:07:25,561 --> 01:07:27,241
They're coming in,
but I don't know which way.

1014
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:28,641
You're two meters from the entrance.

1015
01:07:28,801 --> 01:07:30,961
- We're losing communication.
- Suárez.
