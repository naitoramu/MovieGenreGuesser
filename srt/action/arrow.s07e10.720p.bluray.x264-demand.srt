2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,319
Ms. Mayor,
as of today, Mr. Queen

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,915
is officially working
for the SCPD.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,114
You sure you're
good with this?

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,911
Hiding the truth
from Oliver and Felicity? No.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,676
We need your help.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,599
This is a plan
to level all of Star City.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,016
These are the bomb
schematics we found

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,960
in Felicity's
hideout.

10
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,121
We have got to go
to the cops.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,634
The SCPD are a joke.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,760
We go to The Glades.

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,918
I guess it's time to
pay my dad a visit.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,876
Woman, Voice-Over:
<i>The world is not a fair place.</i>

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,113
<i>Innocent people die
while the guilty go free.</i>

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,674
<i>The system is broken,
filled with corruption, greed,</i>

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,069
<i>and apathy.</i>

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,153
<i>The people who are supposed
to protect us are failing us.</i>

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,736
Woman, Voice-Over: <i>Criminals
continue to walk the streets</i>

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,229
<i>because no one is willing
to stop them.</i>

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,794
<i>The world may not be fair,</i>

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,077
<i>but everyone deserves justice</i>

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,431
<i>and someone looking out
for them.</i>

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,216
<i>And in other news
from city hall,</i>

25
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,312
<i>today marks the dawn of
a new era for Star City,</i>

26
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,433
<i>an unprecedented partnership
between the SCPD</i>

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,831
<i>and the recently unmasked
Oliver Queen,</i>

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,560
<i>now a deputized member of
the police force.</i>

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,830
You expecting someone?

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,038
If anyone from my
organization caught me

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,953
talking to you, it's
lights out for Marco.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,753
This will calm your nerves.

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,549
It certainly does.

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,712
Did you find
William Glenmorgan?

35
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
Not exactly.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,552
We've used Glenmorgan for
a few sensitive jobs.

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,240
So have the Bratva,
the Irish,

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,816
and anyone else rich
enough to pay him,

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,433
but no one has seen
his face.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,119
So how do you hire him?

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,416
Through the online
black market,

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,874
but he's very careful.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,838
Glenmorgan might not
even be his real name.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,515
Word is he's in town
contracting

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,915
for talis global.

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,190
That will get you into
the talis server room.

47
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
You'll have to find your
own way into the building.

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Hey.

49
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:35,994
What'd this guy do
to you anyway?

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,989
I'm not paying you
to ask me questions.

51
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Freeze!

52
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
I said, freeze!

53
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,670
Get on the ground.

54
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,311
Show yourself.
Nobody has to get hurt.

55
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
I need your help.

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Holy crap.

57
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,157
I got you. I got you.

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,834
Game time, rookie.
You ready?

59
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,920
It's not my first
crime scene, Dinah.

60
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,918
No, but it's your first
one as an SCPD deputy,

61
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,197
so try not to screw
it up, huh?

62
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Kidding.

63
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,136
The new Green Arrow has
been dropping felons

64
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,197
at my doorstep
almost every night,

65
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,036
but this is something
different... a b & e.

66
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,831
It doesn't look like
it ended well.

68
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,430
Don't touch that.

69
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,319
This is a crime scene,

70
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,836
and at a crime scene, we
follow proper procedure...

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,840
Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:57,841 --> 00:05:59,593
A concept that is clearly
alien to you.

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
My apologies.

74
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,390
I'll take that, please.

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,716
Yes, captain.

76
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,035
So not everyone is
excited

77
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
about our new
partnership, I see.

78
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,536
It's gonna take some time
for them to get used

79
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,119
to the Green Arrow
wearing a badge.

80
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,278
But, hey, this is
the best lead we've had

81
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,920
on finding out who's
under that hood.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,200
It shouldn't
take too long

83
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,201
to analyze the blood.

84
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,879
By not long, you mean
at least a week.

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,430
My crime lab is buried
under mountains of evidence.

86
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,634
There's another option.

87
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,671
Dinah,
why is the SCPD working with the Green Arrow

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,436
if you are not going
to use my resources?

89
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,630
Please.

90
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
OK.

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,030
Thank you.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,360
Careful. It's gonna be sore.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Not bad.

94
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,136
Well, the Navy didn't teach
me heart surgery or anything,

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,719
but I can handle
a few stitches.

96
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,112
- Thank you.
- No problem.

97
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,717
So you want to tell me
what happened out there?

98
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,193
OK. How about your name?

99
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,590
I appreciate the help,

100
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,096
but I'm not looking
to make new friends.

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,760
- Looks like you could use some.
- I work alone.

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,956
But you came to my place.

103
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,156
And I'm starting
to regret

104
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,152
not taking my chances
at the hospital.

105
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,396
Well, I guess stubbornness
comes with the suit.

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,198
Look, you're doing
a lot of good out there,

107
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,712
and you obviously care
about The Glades.

108
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Let me help you.

109
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,400
You have no idea
what I care about.

110
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,199
If Oliver Queen
knew anything,

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,598
it's that you can't
save the city alone.

112
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,599
I'm not
Oliver Queen.

113
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,840
Zoe, you're supposed to be at the
mayor's fundraising breakfast.

114
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,799
He knows
I hate those things.

115
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
It still doesn't look good

116
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,159
when his chief of staff
shows up late.

117
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,193
He loves schmoozing
donors.

118
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,431
20 bucks says he
didn't even notice.

119
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,096
<i>Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

120
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,679
<i>esteemed donors
and beneficiaries.</i>

121
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,832
<i>It's my honor
to introduce the man</i>

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,720
<i>who single-handedly
cleaned up The Glades...</i>

123
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,436
my friend and your mayor,
Rene Ramirez.

124
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,440
Thank you, Keven.

125
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,071
And thank you all
for coming out today.

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,356
Many years ago,

127
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,316
we came together for
a common purpose...

128
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,712
to improve The Glades
when no one else would.

129
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,035
And look at us now.

130
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,631
<i>The Glades have
never been stronger,</i>

131
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,431
but our work's
far from over.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,630
And I promise you
if I'm reelected,

133
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
I will keep fighting
to make sure

134
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,680
The Glades remain
the greatest place on Earth.

135
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,440
Afternoon,
Mr. Diaz.

136
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,590
I have to say,
the accommodations here...

137
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,711
a lot more comfortable
than slabside.

138
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,314
You can thank me
by telling me

139
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,472
everything you know
about

140
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,950
the terrorist financier
known as Dante.

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,312
Three days you keep on
asking me the same thing,

142
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,711
and I keep on telling you
I don't know anything.

143
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,439
Then why did he help
pay your debt

144
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,960
to the Longbow Hunters?

145
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,438
You must be really desperate
to be reaching out to me.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,630
Is that your husband on
the other side of the glass?

147
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,519
How you doing, Johnny boy?

148
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,831
<i>Keep Stonewalling,
Mr. Diaz,</i>

149
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,353
and watch how fast
those accommodations

150
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,749
you're enjoying
disappear.

151
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,111
<i>You'll see just how
uncomfortable a place</i>

152
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,316
<i>A.R.G.U.S. can be.</i>

153
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,233
Or we can send you back
to slabside,

154
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,436
let you rot there.

155
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,799
Let me be...

156
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,237
Real clear.

157
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,872
For the cheap seats,

158
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,840
screw you.

159
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,198
I want my lawyer.

160
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,074
You belong
to A.R.G.U.S. now.

161
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,714
<i>No one knows
you're here,</i>

162
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,200
<i>and no one
ever will.</i>

163
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,596
So I suggest you
cooperate.

164
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,912
I got nothing more to say.

165
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:48,116
<i>DNA match...
Oliver Queen.</i>

166
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,355
Whoo! DNA signature
confirmed.

167
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,796
I knew you were here before
you even walked in the door!

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How's that?

169
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,480
- That's good work.
- Thank you.

170
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,816
Aren't you
a working man now?

171
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,194
Shouldn't you be at
the SCPD?

172
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,056
Uh, they need a little
help from Team Arrow...

173
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Specifically you.

174
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,391
- Cool.
- You need to analyze this DNA.

175
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,920
It belongs to
the new Green Arrow.

176
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,872
Some husbands bring their
wives home flowers,

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,760
and mine brings me blood
from a crime scene.

178
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,951
They say romance
is dead.

179
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,519
Any idea on who it could be?

180
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Nope.

181
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,589
Oh, you're no fun.

182
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,736
You don't think it could
be Roy, do you?

183
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,594
Oh. We are not even on the
same continent as Roy.

184
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,789
Yeah. Well, let's find out
who our mystery man is,

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
shall we?

186
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:34,721
<i>Ooh!</i>

187
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,831
Well, shame on us for
being so sexist.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,957
Our mystery man is
actually a woman.

189
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,000
Really?

190
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,001
Yeah.

191
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,910
Hey.

192
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Can you sit down?

193
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
Why?

194
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:02,991
'Cause the, um...
well, before you ask,

195
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,680
I mean, no, it's not,
it's not Thea...

196
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,552
the DNA match is on
your father's side.

197
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,714
I'm sorry. Say again?

198
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,834
The vigilante is
your sister.

199
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,560
No!

200
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,561
Get in! Get in, boss.

201
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

202
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,230
What the hell
are you doing?

203
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
You mean besides
saving your ass?

204
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,594
I knew that sniper
was there.

205
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,319
I told you, I don't
need your help.

206
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,896
Well, it looked like you
were gonna kill that guy.

207
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,070
I was gonna take him
alive

208
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,674
to get some answers.

209
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,599
Talis global is no joke.

210
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,475
They recruit Navy seals,
mercs, assassins,

211
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,672
not the kind of folks
you want to mess with alone.

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,194
This is my mission.

213
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,556
It's personal,
so stay out of it.

214
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,074
The next time you
get in my way,

215
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,074
I'm putting an Arrow
through you.

216
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,736
No hits
on the state birth index,

217
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,240
no hospital records.

218
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,936
As far as the government
is concerned,

219
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,599
your mystery sister
doesn't even exist.

220
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,118
Well, my father was
always very good at

221
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
Burying his secrets.

222
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Yeah.

223
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Hey, you OK?

224
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,554
You know, this has
to be a shock,

225
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,399
not as big as
a shock as maybe

226
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,760
becoming the flash and then
fighting alongside batwoman,

227
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,917
but still a shock.

228
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,997
I have come to terms
with the fact that

229
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,274
my father kept things
from us.

230
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Yeah.

231
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,920
Hey, maybe you should
reach out to her.

232
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,600
I feel like if she
wanted to talk to me,

233
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,096
she would've come
and talked to me.

234
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,736
Oliver,
she's running around town dressed like you.

235
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,976
I mean, I'm no therapist,
but I'm pretty sure

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,656
the technical term for
that is cry for help.

237
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,114
She has to have a reason.

238
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Yeah.

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,072
I don't feel comfortable
just barging into her life,

240
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,434
not without knowing more.

241
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,831
I need answers.

242
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,560
Well, luckily for you,
your wife is

243
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,433
very talented at finding
invisible people.

244
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,954
Some even call her
a genius.

245
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,991
So one thing we know about
your father is that he loved

246
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,440
a good old-fashioned
paper trail.

247
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,073
He used an offshore
account to handle

248
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,551
some of his more sensitive
financial transactions.

249
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,719
Yup, recurring payments
to m & h storage

250
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,314
in orchid bay,
and the good news is

251
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,560
the account is still
active.

252
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,976
We need whatever's in
that storage unit.

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,753
We need it here immediately.

254
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,357
OK. Copy that.
And...

255
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
One more thing.

256
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Just one more?

257
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,400
The account is not
registered to your father.

258
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,753
It's registered
to your mom.

259
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,034
There he is...

260
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,480
The man himself.

261
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,320
You think you're
gonna be the one

262
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,990
to get me to talk?

263
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,879
Let me make one thing
clear, Ricardo.

264
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,830
You will tell us exactly
what we need to know.

265
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,279
A little good cop...

266
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,954
heh... bad cop.

267
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,913
I've beaten that game
before.

268
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,039
I'm not here to play
any games with you.

269
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,313
I'm here to offer
you a deal.

270
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,280
John, what are you doing?

271
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
Deputy Director Bell.

272
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
What are you doing here?

273
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:22,336
The Pentagon sent
me to help deal

274
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,750
with the situation
brewing in kahndaq.

275
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,800
Imagine my surprise
when I heard

276
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,877
a rumor that you had
taken Ricardo Diaz

277
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,076
into A.R.G.U.S. custody.

278
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,833
Clearly not just a rumor.

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,320
What kind of deal?

280
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,755
It's simple, really.

281
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,197
You give us Dante,
you go free.

282
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,709
Are you serious?

283
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,189
Those are the terms.

284
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,071
Mr. Diggle,
a word.

285
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,036
You think about it.

286
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Ricardo Diaz
was just arrested.

287
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
Now you two want
to set him free?

288
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,075
What the hell
is going on here?

289
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,152
My apologies for not
looping you in sooner, sir.

290
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,073
Director Michaels and I
were in the process

291
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,994
of reinstating
the ghost initiative.

292
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,155
And Mr. Diaz here was
our first potential recruit.

293
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,440
<i>What's that?</i>

294
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:35,238
A defunct A.R.G.U.S.
program that employed

295
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,995
expendable criminals
for covert operations.

296
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,236
It was scrubbed

297
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,073
shortly after
my predecessor died.

298
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,200
And you think it's a good
idea to bring it back?

299
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,312
Are you questioning
my decision,

300
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,713
deputy director?

301
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,073
Of course not,
madam director.

302
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,515
That kind of radical,
out-of-the-box approach is

303
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,952
exactly the shot in the arm
A.R.G.U.S. needs.

304
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm sure the Pentagon
will be very excited

305
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,196
to hear about this.

306
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,832
Nice work, agent.

307
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,513
Looking stronger
in the ring, peanut.

308
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,031
Just got to work on your
right cross a little more.

309
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,829
Guess the new
Green Arrow needs

310
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,360
Wild Dog's help
after all.

311
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,153
I'll be fine,
dad. Go.

312
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
All right.

313
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,816
So I'll see you soon. OK?

314
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,910
OK.

315
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,156
How you feeling?

316
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Must have been
a nasty bug

317
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,794
<i>for you to miss
3 days of work.</i>

318
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,395
It was, but I'm better now.

319
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,597
Good. Because
the education initiative

320
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,920
is coming to a vote
next week,

321
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,016
and councilman Roberts still
needs some hand-holding, so...

322
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,599
actually, dad, there's
something else

323
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,910
I need
to talk to you about.

324
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,309
Mm-hmm.

325
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,871
Someone's planning
an attack on Star City.

326
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,720
Zoe, please tell me you
haven't been talking to Dinah.

327
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,955
They're planning
to set off multiple bombs.

328
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,114
And we need
to find out where.

329
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,910
I want you to give
the SCPD access

330
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,080
to the Archer Program.

331
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:35,993
You want me to use
our security system,

332
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,199
the very thing that
keeps us safe,

333
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,474
to help Star City?

334
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,270
You're out of
your mind.

335
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,029
You're the mayor.
You have a responsibility...

336
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,472
don't you dare talk to me
about my responsibility!

337
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,270
When The Glades
needed help,

338
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,840
no one came to
our rescue.

339
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,511
Dad, if this bomb
goes off,

340
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,000
thousands of people
could die.

341
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,958
How could you turn
your back on that?

342
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,798
The Archer Program wiped
out crime in The Glades

343
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,599
and helped it
thrive.

344
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,795
You do remember
what happened

345
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,429
when it fell in the
wrong hands once.

346
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,074
And we barely
recovered.

347
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,919
Oh. So I'm the wrong hands?

348
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,560
You know that's not
what I meant.

349
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,632
You know what I know is,

350
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,840
is that you used to stand up
for anyone in need.

351
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,416
It didn't matter which part
of town they were from.

352
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,079
You were a hero.

353
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,034
What happened to you?

354
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
I want to know why.

355
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
You're gonna have to be
more specific.

356
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,310
Why do you want
to help me?

357
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,750
'Cause we're the same.

358
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,235
I doubt that.

359
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,910
You said your mission
is personal.

360
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,709
So is mine.

361
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,472
I watched as my wife
got shot to death

362
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,711
by a drug dealer
from these streets.

363
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,114
And for a long time,
all I saw was red.

364
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
Then I met Oliver Queen
and the team,

365
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
and they helped me
channel my anger

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,071
into a fight
for a better life.

367
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,079
I just want
to pay that forward.

368
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,914
That can't be all.

369
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,596
OK.

370
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,151
Ever since Oliver went
to prison...

371
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,240
I've been alone.

372
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,159
My friends, my team...

373
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,274
they... they moved on, found
another way to be heroes.

374
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,512
And I've been running around
the city helping you.

375
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,720
You can trust me.

376
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,435
Follow me.

377
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,976
If I knew there were
this many boxes,

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,281
I wouldn't have had them all
delivered to our living room.

379
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,155
This feels like
a waste of time.

380
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,120
Hey, you call this
a waste of time?

381
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,674
I don't know. You
were pretty good.

382
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,320
You clearly weren't too happy
about Thea being born, though.

383
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,431
Yeah. But she grew on me.

384
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,240
What's that?

385
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,591
This is a letter
to Walter Steele...

386
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,595
From my dad.

387
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,671
I always forget that Walter
and your dad were friends

388
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,991
before Walter and your
mother, you know?

389
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,590
What does it say?

390
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,356
"Dear Walter,

391
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,840
<i>"as you know, I haven't
always made</i>

392
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>"the best choices,</i>

393
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,477
"and if you're reading
this letter,

394
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
it means I'm gone."

395
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,635
<i>"I need your
help to right one last wrong."</i>

396
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,800
<i>"There's a woman...</i>

397
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,159
<i>"Kazumi Adachi.</i>

398
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,000
<i>"I loved her.</i>

399
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,754
<i>"We had a daughter.</i>

400
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
<i>"And I treated both of them
unfairly.</i>

401
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,349
<i>"I abandoned them.</i>

402
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,712
<i>"I'm not proud of what I did,</i>

403
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,872
<i>"but I'm trying to make
it right.</i>

404
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,751
<i>"You're the only one I trust
with this.</i>

405
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,794
<i>Please take care of Emiko."</i>

406
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,474
Are you OK?

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,116
No.

408
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,194
I don't know
what to think.

409
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,917
Emiko
and her mother were

410
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,918
supposed to be
taken care of

411
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,396
in the event of
my father's passing.

412
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,359
It clearly
didn't happen.

413
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,432
The secret identity of
your unknown sibling

414
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,274
has been locked in
a storage unit for years.

415
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,754
Your mother made sure of it.

416
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,709
God. You must have
so many questions.

417
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,918
This answers
most of them.

418
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,078
I mean, it'd be one thing
if my father had...

419
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,909
An affair.

420
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,278
He had a second family.

421
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,750
He... he had a woman

422
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,513
that he wanted
cared for,

423
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,639
he had a child that
he wanted protected.

424
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
That he loved.

425
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,536
How am I supposed
to believe that he's

426
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,517
ever loved anybody
but himself?

427
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,872
How... how could he
abandon them

428
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,000
in the first place?

429
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:51,435
I don't think moira gave
him much of a choice.

430
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,235
I worked...

431
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,678
So long and hard
to redeem

432
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,160
my family's name

433
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,755
after the terrible
things

434
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,070
that they've done,

435
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,515
but abandoning this woman

436
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,479
and a little girl?

437
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,993
It's unforgiveable.

438
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,553
What do you want to do?

439
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,076
You put all this
together alone?

440
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,035
People can't let you down
if you don't let them in.

441
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,714
Spoken like someone who
knows what that feels like.

442
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,999
My father gave this
to my mother

443
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,799
the last time he saw her.

444
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,796
When I was a little kid,

445
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,520
we used this quilt
to build play forts.

446
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,511
We'd play so long that
sometimes,

447
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,320
we'd just fall asleep there.

448
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,233
And before we closed
our eyes,

449
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,959
we always hoped for
the same thing...

450
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,799
that we'd wake up in
the morning, go upstairs,

451
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,151
and my father would be
waiting for us.

452
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,840
I'm guessing
he never was.

453
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,992
Mom and I struggled,
but we got by.

454
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,996
We had each other
no matter what.

455
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,632
But last year, there was
a fire in the apartment.

456
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,096
And the fire department was
nowhere to be found

457
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,554
because who gives a damn

458
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,359
about some tenement
in The Glades?

459
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,176
By the time
they finally arrived,

460
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
there were no survivors.

461
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,436
Your mom was in there.

462
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,992
It wasn't the fire
that killed her.

463
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
He did.

464
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,070
She was dead before
the fire even started.

465
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,560
He put a bullet in her head,

466
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,320
a very specific
kind of bullet.

467
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,796
You tracked a bullet?

468
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,240
Why would he kill your mom?

469
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
That's what I've been
trying to figure out.

470
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I know these guys.

471
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,200
The arms dealer who
provided the rifle

472
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,400
and the arsonist who tried
to destroy all the evidence.

473
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,750
Your mission
is about revenge.

474
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,999
It's about justice,

475
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,310
which has always been in
short supply in The Glades.

476
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,152
William Glenmorgan is
my last stop.

477
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,993
And you need help
taking him down.

478
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,397
I need to finish this.

479
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,873
Let's go get that
son of a bitch.

480
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,269
You lost your edge.

481
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,996
What the hell do you want?

482
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,038
I want your access codes
to Archer.

483
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,993
So you have been talking
to Zoe.

484
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,520
If you've gotten her mixed
up in your canary business...

485
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,319
she's not a kid
anymore,

486
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,195
and that's not
why I'm here.

487
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,357
We found this in Felicity's
base of operations.

488
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,675
She's a criminal.

489
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,354
Criminals like
to blow stuff up.

490
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,440
Felicity's dead, Rene.

491
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,036
<i>She was murdered.</i>

492
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,840
And we think the person
who killed her was

493
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,234
behind this plan.

494
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,716
Like I told Zoe,

495
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,475
whatever happens in
Star City isn't my problem.

496
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,876
Well, the old Rene would've
made it his problem.

497
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,434
Jeez.
Do you have any idea

498
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,432
how much you've hurt
your daughter?

499
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,514
She used to idolize you.

500
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,273
At least as mayor,

501
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,234
I'm actually getting
things done,

502
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,755
not wasting my time
running around the city

503
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,191
with a hockey mask,
pretending that it mattered.

504
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,840
It did matter!

505
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,233
<i>And it still matters.</i>

506
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,113
We made a promise
to always keep fighting,

507
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,274
to be there for each
other no matter what...

508
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,355
all of us...

509
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,960
you, me, Roy, Diggle,
Oliver, and Felicity.

510
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,440
We owe her this.

511
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,757
The next time
you come back here,

512
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,320
I will have you arrested.

513
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,756
And you stay the hell away
from my daughter.

514
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,992
For Zoe's sake, I do not
want to hurt you,

515
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,277
but I'm not leaving here
without those codes.

516
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,616
The last time we fought
each other,

517
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,597
it didn't end so well
for you.

518
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,275
Hey. You are
still upset.

519
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Damn right.

520
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,576
You had no right
to make that call.

521
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,136
You're right. It is way
above my pay grade,

522
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,674
but it worked out
for us.

523
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,479
Is that your version
of an apology?

524
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,030
Hey, Lyla,
you have to admit,

525
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,560
I actually did help.

526
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,917
I'm the one who shut down
the ghost initiative.

527
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,834
And I swore never
to reinstate it.

528
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,195
You knew that.

529
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,839
I know that,
but you would have

530
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,116
absolute oversight
and zero accountability.

531
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,476
This is the perfect cover
for our operation.

532
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,360
Lyla, we had to do something
to get Diaz to play ball.

533
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,393
Which you did by

534
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,756
undermining my authority
and forcing my hand.

535
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,160
And here I thought I was
the one in danger

536
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,879
of becoming
Amanda Waller.

537
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,896
Glenmorgan is holed up
in his compound

538
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,990
outside Star City.

539
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,514
I spotted at least
10 bodyguards.

540
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,956
So the killer's surrounded
by even more killers. Great.

541
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,280
And he's got a bleeding edge
security system.

542
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,880
Bypassing security system's
is gonna be a piece of cake.

543
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,336
You guys have cake?
I mean, I don't want cake,

544
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,816
but if you got a cake,
I would have a piece.

545
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,896
But if you don't have it,
don't worry about it.

546
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,016
You don't have it, right?
OK. Anyway, it's... yeah, hi.

547
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,960
<i>This is Curtis.</i>

548
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:02,873
Curtis, this is... you still
haven't told me your name.

549
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Emiko.

550
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,959
I'm a huge fan
of your work.

551
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
This was not the deal.

552
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,675
I know, but you agreed
to letting people help you,

553
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,400
and if we're going
to get to Glenmorgan,

554
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,830
we need a guy in a chair.

555
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,040
<i>Person in a chair.</i>

556
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
Fine.

557
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,200
Does this mean what
I think it means?

558
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
Suit up.

559
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,918
It does mean what I
think it means. Heh!

560
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,590
Surveillance feed
coming through now.

561
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,435
Oh, yeah. That's a lot of
bad-looking dudes with guns.

562
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,872
<i>I see why you guys
needed me for backup.</i>

563
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,280
Can you disable the alarms?

564
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
I can do you one better.

565
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,281
I can knock out
the whole system... cameras,

566
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,736
motion sensors,
the whole shebang.

567
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,194
But it's up
to you guys to deal with

568
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,680
that army of
terminators yourself.

569
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,519
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

570
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,511
And here we go.

571
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,239
We got a situation
out here, boss.

572
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,592
Then why are you talking
to me about it?

573
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Deal with it.

574
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Let's move.

575
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Ow!

576
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,280
Teamwork makes
the dream work.

577
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,776
Go ahead.
You go get him.

578
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,995
I'll take care
of them.

579
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,440
If you want something
done right...

580
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Kill 'em yourself.

581
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,080
Whoever you are, you
just made a big mistake.

582
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,760
I dare you
to do that again.

583
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,714
You come into my house
to kill me?

584
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,873
You'd better have
a damn good reason.

585
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,230
Kazumi Adachi.

586
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,280
You shot and killed her
last year in The Glades.

587
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,239
I've killed
a lot of people.

588
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,470
Tell me why you did it.

589
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
<i>I didn't.</i>

590
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,560
Guns aren't really
my thing.

591
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,111
Liar! The bullet that
killed her was yours.

592
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,715
It wasn't. Someone
must have set me up.

593
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,440
I've been on a covert
mission in Santa Prisca

594
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,273
for the last two years.

595
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,238
I just got back into
the country last month.

596
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,716
I swear.

597
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,120
It wasn't me.

598
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
You did it. You got him.

599
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,394
Glenmorgan
didn't kill her.

600
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
What?

601
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,074
I failed my mission.

602
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,000
I failed my mother.

603
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,153
You must really hate
that book.

604
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,440
Go home to your
daughter.

605
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,037
I did. She told me
to come here.

606
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,549
I'm sorry things didn't go

607
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,313
the way you hoped for
last night.

608
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,237
Glenmorgan's alibi
checks out.

609
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,955
He really was in
Santa Prisca

610
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,600
the night my mother
was murdered.

611
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,715
I spent months working
through that list,

612
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,837
thinking I was getting
closer to answers.

613
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,599
Now I'm back to square one.

614
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,429
The bullet's
still a lead.

615
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,160
Someone purposely sent me
down the wrong path.

616
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm gonna find out why.

617
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,679
Yeah. We are.

618
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,313
You're not alone in
this anymore.

619
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,040
I'm still not
looking for a team.

620
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,395
OK, fine.

621
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,470
Then how about
a partner?

622
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,033
You'd be breaking the law.

623
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,112
Hmm, never stopped
me before.

624
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
What about your daughter?

625
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,676
Again, her idea.

626
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,592
Archer access codes
as promised.

627
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,840
<i>How long
will this take?</i>

628
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,071
William wrote us
a targeted search algorithm.

629
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:55,721
If you got the codes,
that means my dad

630
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
decided to help us.

631
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Not exactly.

632
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,556
I forced him to.

633
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,592
I thought seeing you
would make him remember

634
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,830
who he used to be.

635
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Hey.

636
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,957
Your dad may have lost
his way,

637
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,078
but deep down, I still
believe he's good.

638
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
Don't give up
on him yet.

639
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,160
<i>Access granted.</i>

640
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,276
We're in.

641
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,960
This is feed
from yesterday,

642
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,152
but we now have
unfettered access

643
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,676
to the Archer Program's
entire security interface.

644
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,515
Let's find those bombs.

645
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,275
Yesterday was a bigger
success than we anticipated.

646
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,016
You had them eating out
of your hand.

647
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,315
A shoo-In for reelection.

648
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,793
That's not why I
called you in.

649
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,440
Last night, one of
the canaries

650
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
paid me a visit.

651
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,554
<i>She has the plans.</i>

652
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,231
Maybe there's another way
for us to achieve our goal.

653
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,558
The Glades is the future.
We've always agreed on that.

654
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,000
My mission to build up
The Glades

655
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,476
never included wiping out
the rest of the city.

656
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,279
Well, Star City's a cancer.

657
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,475
The only way to get rid of
a cancer is to destroy it.

658
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,154
The canary also said

659
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,993
Felicity Smoak
was murdered.

660
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,880
You wouldn't happen
to know

661
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,109
anything about that,
would you?

662
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,433
Ms. Smoak was becoming
a liability.

663
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,629
<i>She had to be dealt with.</i>

664
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,070
Is that a problem?

665
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Of course not.

666
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,480
Good. I would hate to think

667
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,633
that you're getting
cold feet, Mr. Mayor.

668
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
Psst.

669
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,829
You OK?

670
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Dumb question?

671
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
No.

672
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,835
You know, even after
everything that I've learned

673
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,154
about my father...

674
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,470
I just never expected
anything like this.

675
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,678
He ruined Emiko's life.

676
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,031
Just abandoned her.

677
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,359
Well, you don't have to.

678
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,240
You said you didn't want
to barge into her life

679
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,560
without knowing
more about her,

680
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,911
and now you do, so
what's holding you back?

681
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,153
I just think that I'll
make things worse.

682
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,039
Oliver, you became
the Green Arrow

683
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,550
to right your father's
wrongs.

684
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,030
What your parents did
to Emiko and her mother

685
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,839
is beyond wrong.

686
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,875
You are a better man

687
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,555
than your father
ever was.

688
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,916
Don't make the mistakes
that he did.

689
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,312
Reach out
to your sister.

690
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,360
Make things right.

691
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,395
When I agreed
to this deal,

692
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,836
no one said
anything

693
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,640
about sticking a bomb
in the back of my head.

694
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,230
Didn't we?

695
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Do it.

696
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Tracking is activated,

697
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,432
and the subcortical
incendiary is armed.

698
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,675
So this is your
failsafe.

699
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,597
You are, which
is why we need

700
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,831
to take every precaution
to keep you in line,

701
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,759
<i>because the second you
step out of it...</i>

702
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Boom.

703
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,590
You'd better
hope so, lady,

704
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,390
'cause if it doesn't...

705
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,752
I'm coming for you.

706
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,840
Emiko, Voice-Over: <i>People say that
revenge corrupts the soul...</i>

707
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,751
<i>That if you go down that path,
you'll never come back.</i>

708
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,554
<i>But sometimes, embracing
the darkness is</i>

709
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,473
<i>the only way to get
justice.</i>

710
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,511
<i>My name is Emiko Queen.</i>

711
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,516
<i>I will get justice
for my mother,</i>

712
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,150
<i>and no one will stand in my way.</i>

713
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Hello, Emiko.

714
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,794
Greg, move your head.
