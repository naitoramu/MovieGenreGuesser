1
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,682
I'll take this.

2
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,721
Merci.

3
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,566
Sorry about all the...

4
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,195
Oh, don't be stupid.
You did us a favor.

5
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,640
What are we gonna do with him?

6
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,174
Ah, we'll take care of it.

7
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,088
The-the, uh, tracking chip.

8
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,380
Already disabled.

9
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,643
Sit down and relax,
Petit Hughie.

10
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,614
Oi, where you think
you're going?

11
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,709
I'm going home.
I need clothes.

12
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,863
We'll get you clothes.

13
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,031
I want my clothes.

14
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,280
I'll be right back.

15
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:56,832
You are, perhaps...
in a state of shock, mon ami.

16
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,247
Hughie, you just arse-bombed
America's sweetheart.

17
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,406
You can't just piss off.

18
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,133
I need to go home.

19
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,842
All right.
Frenchie will go with you.

20
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,974
Wait, what? No.

21
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,721
Either he goes with you,
or I break your legs.

22
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,437
Good lad.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,570
Translucent's skin,
it won't burn off.

24
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,361
Where you gonna stash it
Homelander can't find it?

25
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:38,026
Nowhere.

26
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,155
But we can slow the cunt down
a bit.

27
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,633
Come on in.

28
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,970
Ms. Stillwell. Hello.

29
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,274
Please sit.

30
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:55,357
Starlight, that video.

31
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,213
- Ms. Stillwell, please.
- No, no. Let me finish.

32
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,237
The date-rape girl? The victim?

33
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,992
She saw that video on YouTube

34
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,664
and she came forward
to thank you.

35
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,413
She could not have been
more effusive.

36
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:12,416
That's... that's good, right?

37
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,631
It is fantastic.
You're polling through the roof.

38
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,933
You have a huge boost with men...
for the ass-kicking, of course...

39
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,548
but with women, too.
They love the empowerment.

40
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,505
16 points with females 18 to 49,

41
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,425
even in the liberal
retreat jurisdictions

42
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,975
like New York and San Francisco.

43
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,769
- I don't know what to say.
- You just have to enjoy this.

44
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:35,904
This is so good for you.
And it's so great for us,

45
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,903
because it is
a partnership, after all.

46
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,985
- This is Seth and Evan from marketing.
- Hi.

47
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,841
They have some brilliant ideas
on how to capitalize

48
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,275
on all the buzz. Gentlemen.

49
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,446
- Okay. So...
- Yeah.

50
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:50,495
Now, small-town Iowa girl,
unexpected child prodigy,

51
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,581
is chosen for The Seven.

52
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,246
Destiny knocks
on the girl next door's door,

53
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,255
and she answers,
to fight for truth and justice

54
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,218
- side by side with her heroes.
- The Big Apple is rough, tumble.

55
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,431
It's got worms. Muggers
and rapists and thieves, oh, my.

56
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,771
Dorothy is not
in Kansas anymore.

57
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,227
Or Iowa. Poor girl gets knocked
around something fierce.

58
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,359
- Kicked while she's down.
- So what does she do? Does she cry in her milk?

59
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,227
- Does she quit?
- No way!

60
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,654
She adapts! She transforms!

61
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,087
Embraces her feminine strengths.

62
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,296
Good-bye, Yellow Brick Road...

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,740
And hello, Starlight.

64
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,624
I can't wear that.

65
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,334
What?

66
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,924
Why not? It's beautiful.

67
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,629
Seriously?

68
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,009
I-It's just...

69
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,218
It's not me.

70
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,838
I designed Homelander's suit.

71
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,006
- This isn't my first rodeo.
- You're wrong.

72
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,885
It's totally you. It's bold,
it's brave, it's feminist.

73
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,312
- How is that feminist?
- Empowering.

74
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,811
It says you're confident
in your own skin,

75
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,234
and you're not afraid
to show it.

76
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,942
Most importantly,
it tells the story.

77
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:02,403
Of your transformation, of...
of what you're going through.

78
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:06,986
How exactly do you know what
I'm going through, exactly?

79
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,244
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,656
I-I appreciate the effort,

81
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,705
I really do,
but I'm fine with my old outfit.

82
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,591
- We're not.
- Excuse me?

83
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,798
Starlight, like I said before,
this is a partnership.

84
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,259
In a partnership, there is give
and there is take.

85
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,260
It's my body.

86
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,262
I have the right to choose
how much of it I show.

87
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,265
That is true. You do.

88
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,348
You just won't be doing it
in The Seven,

89
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,404
unless it is wrapped in that.

90
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,605
Tomorrow,
A-Train versus Shockwave.

91
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,406
The race of the century.

92
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,329
The question now, Al,
is can A-Train keep his title

93
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,949
as the fastest man alive?

94
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,155
Or is tomorrow the day
he runs out of track

95
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,416
at the hands of this
fresh-faced young challenger?

96
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,038
Just wait here, okay?

97
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,479
Tomorrow, live on pay-per-view,

98
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,133
the race of the century.

99
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,921
Well, Shockwave...

100
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,299
Hughie?

101
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,933
Oh, hey, Dad.

102
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,219
Wh... look at the,

103
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,575
- you-you've, this is...
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about this.

104
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,139
I just, I've been meaning
to clean up the Supe stuff

105
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,556
for a while now, so...

106
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,153
What, are you going somewhere?

107
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,492
- Yeah. For a while.
- Where?

108
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,657
Uh, I don't know.

109
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,487
Well, now,
you're scaring me, Hugh.

110
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,413
All right, now,
I-I spoke to Dr. Feldman...

111
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,834
- My pediatrician?
- He's still your doctor.

112
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,893
And he's given me the name of
someone you can-you can talk to.

113
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,497
Help you, you know,
get back to normal.

114
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,344
There's no normal anymore.

115
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,221
What do you mean,
there's... Look.

116
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,218
We've always been very open
with each other, right?

117
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,391
We-We've always told
each other everything.

118
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,809
- Talk to me.
- Stop it.

119
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,927
- What do you mean, stop it?
- Stop it.

120
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,015
I have never told you
everything.

121
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,401
I have never told you how much
I hate sitting on that couch,

122
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,649
staring at the TV
like we're already dead.

123
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,323
How much I fucking hate
Pizza Rolls.

124
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,162
- No, you love Pizza Rolls.
- When I was seven!

125
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,866
I am not seven.

126
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,724
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,446
My father was bipolar.

128
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,865
One night, when I was ten,

129
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,619
he tried to smother me
with a Hello Kitty duvet.

130
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,022
- Give him that work!
- Kick his ass!

131
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,567
Yo!

132
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,075
What the hell
is wrong with y'all?

133
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,617
This is not
what we do here, gentlemen.

134
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,121
Now, didn't I tell you,
we take turns at the pong?

135
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:08,594
Oslo, Deeaygo, tell me you
put your names up on my board?

136
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:09,957
Apologies, Mr. Milk. No, sir.

137
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,553
Nuh-uh, me, neither, Mr. Milk.

138
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,900
Which means
that you have cut in line

139
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,884
in front of everybody else
in here.

140
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,756
What else does it mean?
Come on, spit it out.

141
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,655
Means that we're disrespecting
all the other niggas...

142
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,889
Excuse me?

143
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,351
All our fellow brothers
in the unit.

144
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:24,982
Now, you both know how to write

145
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,228
in the English language
in a passable fashion.

146
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,248
I know that, 'cause I've seen
to it myself, have I not?

147
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,072
- Yes, sir.
- Then please, place your John Hancocks on my board.

148
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,569
Yes sir, Mr. Milk. Thank you.

149
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,031
At the bottom of the list.

150
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,164
Oh, hell nah.

151
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,376
What the fuck do you want?

152
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,537
What, I can't visit me old mate?

153
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,745
Rekindle the unbreakable bonds
of brothers-in-arms?

154
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,166
- Nope.
- Come on, M.M.

155
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,545
Bring it in.

156
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,695
Look, if it's all the same,
let's just cut the small talk.

157
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,389
All you're gonna do is lie
and say how you're doing fine,

158
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,811
and I'm gonna lie and pretend
like I'm happy to see you.

159
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,480
Why are you here?

160
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,687
All right.

161
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,402
- How'd you like to come back, have another go?
- Mm-mm.

162
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,954
No, sir. Keep it to yourself.

163
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,528
I don't want to know nothing
about nothing.

164
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,075
I'm a happy man now.
Life is good,

165
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,790
- Monique is back, we're good, just...
- Oh, yeah? How is Monique?

166
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,791
Spits on the ground
every time your name comes up.

167
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,293
I can't do that
to her again, man.

168
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,455
Not to mention, I'm actually
making progress with these boys.

169
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,755
Yeah, so I can see.

170
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,053
Don't make me come out there!

171
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,555
Well, this is God's work.

172
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,808
I can't argue with that.
But a man of your talents?

173
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,442
- Wasted here.
- Look, Butcher,

174
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,520
we were into some bad shit, man.

175
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,355
Even before the Mallory stuff.
And that, that was...

176
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,489
If I'm gonna make a difference,

177
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,201
I just feel more comfortable
doing it on a smaller scale.

178
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,952
I'm a motherfucker with a heart.

179
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,414
Whereas you?

180
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,370
You're just a motherfucker.

181
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,590
Funny you should mention
making a difference...

182
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,256
...'cause we just dusted a Supe.

183
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,184
Bullshit.

184
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,813
Translucent.

185
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,938
What the f...

186
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,361
Well, come on,
you lime-sucking smart-ass.

187
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,148
How the hell did you do it?

188
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,782
Well...

189
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,780
Big lump of C-4,
packed right up his fudger.

190
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,704
Boom. Claret everywhere,
fucking diabolical.

191
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,535
But before the fireworks,
he coughed up a solid lead.

192
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,382
Spilled the beans in a big way.

193
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,957
Now, we play this right,

194
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,382
we could shake up
the whole hornets' nest,

195
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,381
bring down Seven
and Vought at the same time.

196
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,514
Mm-hmm.

197
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,051
You mean do Homelander?

198
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,313
This is about Becca, isn't it?

199
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,890
It's always about Becca
with you.

200
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,436
Oh, you ain't got your reasons?

201
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,029
It'll be different this go,
all right?

202
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,320
None of that
"secrets and lies" bollocks.

203
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,744
And that Mallory shit
ain't gonna happen this time.

204
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,833
I swear to God.

205
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,325
Are you bringing Frenchie back?

206
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,785
'Cause I can't work
with that motherfucker.

207
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,296
Frenchie?
No, I ain't seen him in years.

208
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,009
M.M., you're the only bloke
I can trust.

209
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,349
Since when
have you ever trusted anybody?

210
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,559
Oh, fuck.

211
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,662
Senator Calhoun,
you've gone on the record

212
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,330
- against superheroes in the military.
- Who's a good boy?

213
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,832
- Who's a good boy?
- Why change your tune?

214
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,476
No one's changing their tune.

215
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,364
Uh, it's just I realized that

216
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,151
it's an issue that affects all Americans.

217
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,091
- Can't you make it... stop?
- It shouldn't be decided by a few congressmen

218
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,467
- hidden in committee.
- He's not crying.

219
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,831
The bill needs to go
to the floor.

220
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:10,868
Oh, okay.

221
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,200
Aw. Aw.

222
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,865
Oh, no. We can't have that...

223
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,173
You know, I heard Translucent's
tracking chip went dead.

224
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,958
- Yeah?
- He could be hurt.

225
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:20,963
How?

226
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,304
He's got diamond skin.

227
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,629
He's gonna be fine.

228
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,923
My guys are on it.

229
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,926
All right,
I forgot to give you these.

230
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,138
Here.

231
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,388
What is it?

232
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,219
Those are
your new talking points.

233
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,144
Now that the military bill
is out of committee,

234
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,774
corporate wants
to sell the shit out of it.

235
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,731
Yes. They do.

236
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,738
Hey. Y-You remember when
you wanted me in the red cape

237
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,658
and-and I said,
"No. No, no, no.

238
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,986
Make it the flag"?
Remember that?

239
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,992
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. I don't need these.

240
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,994
Okay?

241
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,156
I can sell my way
into the military.

242
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,245
Thank you.

243
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,880
You take care of your baby,
and I'll take care of mine.

244
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,048
Mr. Edgar wrote
those personally.

245
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:06,798
So if you want to go to 82
and take it up with him,

246
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,841
be my guest.

247
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,306
Oh, yes.

248
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,967
Oh, you're a happy boy now, huh?

249
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,925
Are you a happy boy?

250
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:26,322
A rental, you cheap bastard?

251
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,339
Who do you think I am,
some double-O wanker?

252
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,493
In case you hadn't noticed,
we ain't exactly rolling in it.

253
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,833
And you don't think
this is conspicuous?

254
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,388
Conspicuous? No, I don't think

255
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,542
it's conspicuous.
I think a big black van

256
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,290
with fucking "Flowers"
on the side is conspicuous.

257
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,553
This is just another truck
on the street.

258
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,798
Bang on time.

259
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,516
Uh, hi.

260
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,018
Hughie.

261
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,690
Smelly motherfucker.

262
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,503
- Butcher, who is this guy?!
- You'll give the game away!

263
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,147
Not until this frog gets
what's coming.

264
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,655
Only thing that is coming

265
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,257
- is me on your mother's titties!
- Let me through at him, bitch!

266
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,760
- Hey!
- We had an agreement about him.

267
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,178
We agreed to put a pin in it,
all right?

268
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,752
- What agreement?
- There was no pin.

269
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,014
I don't trust this French whore.

270
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,998
I am more American than you,

271
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,789
you racist piece of shit!

272
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,644
- Why are they fighting?!
- Nothing. It is water under the bridge.

273
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,168
You tell that
to Mallory's grandkids.

274
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,671
Tell them it's water
under the bridge.

275
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,384
- That wasn't my fault, huh?
- Who is Mallory?

276
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,795
All right, the both of you,
knock it on the head, now!

277
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,942
Shit!

278
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,821
Hey, Monique.

279
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,163
How you doing, baby?

280
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,909
Ooh, I forgot to marinade
the tilapia.

281
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,411
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

282
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,544
Okay, how 'bout this?

283
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,171
How about,
on my way home from work,

284
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,669
I stop by DeLuca's,
pick up two fat tenderloins,

285
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,064
some portobello mushrooms, that
pinot that you love so much.

286
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,798
Yeah, baby.

287
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,800
Okay, I-I got to go.

288
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,222
All right, sweetheart.

289
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,140
Yeah. Me, too.

290
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,309
Baby, I just...

291
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,058
Uh, you're right, you're right.

292
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,559
I love you, too.

293
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,601
Okay. Bye.

294
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,779
Fuck all of y'all, okay?

295
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,289
All right. All right.

296
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,748
Listen, you two knobbers
kiss and make up, yeah?

297
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,580
We got a fucking job to do.

298
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,001
Fuck it. Dégage, huh?

299
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,085
Get out of here.

300
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,800
Who's this guy?

301
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,221
The new lad. Hughie.

302
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,139
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

303
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,467
That's a... nickname?

304
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,973
No, my mother actually named me
Mother's Milk.

305
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,265
- Did-did she?
- So we got

306
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,037
a French whore
and a Stephen fucking Hawking.

307
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,691
- Great job, Butcher.
- Well, it was

308
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,319
Stephen fucking Hawking
who dusted the Supe.

309
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,775
Oh.

310
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,779
She's home.

311
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,964
That's Popclaw, right?

312
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,158
A-Train's girlfriend?

313
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,329
Oh, Popclaw. Hi.

314
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,699
Uh, you know the-the rent?

315
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,075
- It was due last week.
- Right. Of course.

316
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,476
You think her
and A-Train are, uh...

317
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,250
Yeah, playing bury the bishop.

318
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,146
Didn't hear nothing about it.
I'm usually up on these things.

319
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,481
According to Translucent,

320
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,715
A-Train knows this bird
inside out.

321
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:35,927
I'll drop the check off ASAP.

322
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,587
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,045
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

324
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,983
All right.
Let's get the bugs sorted,

325
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,559
see for ourselves.

326
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,235
Where-Where'd you get this shit,
Circuit City?

327
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,157
Right? He's a cheap bastard.

328
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,406
You know, we don't actually need
to sneak in anything.

329
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,583
- Eh?
- Look, all I need's her IPv6 number.

330
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,883
Every desktop, every smart TV
in the house has a camera on it.

331
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,186
They probably have one
in every room.

332
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,380
- Even in the toilet?
- No, Frenchie,

333
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,024
not in the toilet. Look,
I just need five minutes inside.

334
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,218
I mean, home service
is my specialty.

335
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,142
Hello, ma'am,
we're with Bryman Audio-Visual.

336
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,984
We got the new router. I'm...

337
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,400
This is-is Hughie.

338
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,269
I'm Gary.

339
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,210
- I didn't make an appointment.
- Oh, well, your manager did.

340
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,324
- He's upgrading the whole building.
- I just saw

341
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,072
my landlord.
He didn't mention it.

342
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,823
I've got a work order
right here, ma'am.

343
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,656
Only takes a second.

344
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,372
And we can get you all the way
up to a thousand Mbps.

345
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,003
That-That's a lot.

346
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,830
Okay. Come on in.

347
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,567
The computer's right over here

348
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,971
- if you need it.
- Uh, yeah.

349
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,404
I just need
to sign on to your server

350
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,138
in order to download
the service package.

351
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,350
- Yeah, sure.
- I have a confession.

352
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,231
We're really big fans. I mean,

353
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,477
Terminal Beauty 3...

354
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,649
Whew. Damn.

355
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,068
Oh. Thanks.

356
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,397
Yeah, that one
really came together.

357
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,613
Let me know
if you guys need anything else.

358
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,664
Thank you.

359
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,222
You gonna eye-fuck that all day?

360
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,508
Let's go.

361
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,191
Hmm.

362
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,071
What is it?

363
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,648
Nothing.

364
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,012
This kid is full of surprises.

365
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,091
Okay, ma'am, all done.

366
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,854
Thank you, guys.

367
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,019
Thank you.

368
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,518
Get your John Hancock?

369
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,139
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

370
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,360
Ooh. Excuse me, bud.

371
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,367
What, you want a...
autograph or something?

372
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,969
Haven't we met before?

373
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,677
Maybe.

374
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,602
I meet a ton of people.

375
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,431
Come on, man.
My meter's running out.

376
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,386
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

377
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,766
- Excuse us, brother.
- Yeah.

378
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,357
You trying to get us killed?

379
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,567
Yeah.

380
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,395
I'll be right there.

381
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,243
Look, Translucent's
probably just lurking

382
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,069
around a gynecologist's office
or something.

383
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,508
For two days? Come on.

384
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,742
I don't get it.

385
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,453
Why is no one concerned
about this?

386
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,753
Because if people find out
one of the Seven is missing,

387
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,287
they panic.

388
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,290
Besides, you can't fucking stand
Translucent.

389
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,673
- Give 'em hell, Homelander!
- Yeah, you bet, pal.

390
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,671
Of course. But if something's
happened to him,

391
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,673
then that's a direct attack
on the Seven,

392
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,755
which is a direct attack on me.

393
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,194
You've managed
to make this about you

394
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,598
in less than 20 seconds flat.

395
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,447
Hey, I'm not the one who's down
a point and a half.

396
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,101
So I think
what you mean to say is,

397
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,770
"Gee, thanks, Homelander,

398
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,268
"for showing up out of the blue

399
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,745
and bringing the extra press
to my collar."

400
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,809
Homelander. Maeve.

401
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:44,145
Captain, you guys
are the real heroes.

402
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,442
- We're just glad we can help, right?
- That's right.

403
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,565
- Where's your shooter?
- Shooter's on 31.

404
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,783
All right. Sit tight.

405
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,080
Elevators?

406
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,924
I'm just saying,
a missing team member

407
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,089
is more important
than A-Train's insipid race.

408
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,589
Mr. Edgar
wants us both at the race

409
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,342
to roll out
his new talking points.

410
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,473
You know this.

411
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,549
I've X-rayed Edgar, you know.

412
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,885
He is this close to a coronary.

413
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,891
He's got blood like engine oil.

414
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,983
And Stillwell,
with that mewling baby...

415
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,809
it's ridiculous.

416
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,654
They're just people.

417
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,649
But they snap their fingers
and we jump.

418
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,401
Why? Why do we do that?

419
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,953
'Cause they sign our checks.

420
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,157
Can we just cut to the part

421
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,157
where you show up to the race
anyway?

422
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,615
See, that's why I love you.

423
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,793
You're the only one

424
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,751
who tells me the truth.

425
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,721
Mm-mm.

426
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,809
It's all over.

427
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,778
It's all over now.

428
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,739
There you go.

429
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,459
Goddamn it.

430
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,680
That was my collar.

431
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,677
Eh, it still is.

432
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,639
Yeah, well, I can't walk him
on The Today Show like that.

433
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,390
No, that's true.

434
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,932
I got excited.

435
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,305
I'm sorry.

436
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,191
I'm sure you are.

437
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,188
You know the drill.

438
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,649
He shot at us first.

439
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,185
Attagirl.

440
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,913
The things I let you do to me.

441
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,165
Yeah.

442
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,706
We're not even dating anymore.

443
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,587
Fuck.

444
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,149
Want me to do the thing?

445
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,608
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

446
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,438
Okay.

447
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,861
That's a good boy.

448
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,704
Mmm.

449
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,343
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

450
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,761
Tickles. Tickling.

451
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,717
What's the problem?

452
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,813
Shockwave's the problem.

453
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,268
What if I lose?

454
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,058
You're not gonna lose.

455
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,232
You're the fastest man alive.

456
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,060
Until I'm not.

457
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,106
You know what Stillwell told me?

458
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,649
If I don't win, I'm out.

459
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,412
Nobody wants the second
fastest man in The Seven.

460
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,699
Babe.

461
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:30,211
Compound V. Where'd you put it?

462
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:34,001
Oh, you sure, babe?
I mean, that stuff, it...

463
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,466
amps you up something fierce.

464
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,837
Remember last time?

465
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,763
Last time's not gonna
happen again.

466
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,932
I'm under control. Uh...

467
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,682
You ran through a girl, baby.

468
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,944
That's not what
I would call "control."

469
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,688
That shit's a slippery slope.

470
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,520
Take it from me.

471
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,526
No, I... I need it.

472
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,398
Honey, I'll still
love you even if you lose.

473
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,906
How is that supposed
to help me right now?

474
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,618
- Uh...
- I have to win this thing.

475
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,160
I don't want to be
some washed up B-squader.

476
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,584
Like me?

477
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,133
No, not like... That's...

478
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,129
I got to go.

479
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,215
Why don't you just tell me
where the V is, please?

480
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,971
I'll come back to see you
tomorrow after the race.

481
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,175
What are you talking about?

482
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,016
I've been meaning to tell you.

483
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,522
Are you kidding me?

484
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,815
I have been getting my hair
done, threading my eyebrows,

485
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,740
waxing my body
like a plucked chicken,

486
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,739
so that we could finally
stand up there together tomorrow

487
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,832
in front of the world
as a couple.

488
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,618
I mean, it was all cleared
with Stillwell and everything.

489
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,830
Um...

490
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,883
You did clear it with Stillwell.

491
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,209
Look, our time is gonna come,
I promise,

492
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,665
but I got to get
my leverage back first.

493
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,220
Where's the V?

494
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,059
- What the hell is Compound V?
- Sounds like

495
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,773
some kind
of performance enhancer.

496
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,113
- Steroids for Supes?
- Yeah. Well, whatever it was,

497
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,399
he was juiced on it
when he murdered Robin.

498
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,380
What are you grinning at?

499
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,133
Oh, I don't know, mate.

500
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,675
Maybe it's 'cause
The Seven might just be a squad

501
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,309
of manky 'roid heads.

502
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,767
Now this is exactly the kind
of malfeasance that Langley

503
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,308
is gonna eat up by the spoonful.

504
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,941
Not until we're sure
it does what we think it does.

505
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,019
If we get a bit,
can you work it out?

506
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,833
Oh, I can run
some tests, of course.

507
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,187
But there's no way of knowing
unless I try some myself.

508
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,775
Amazing idea.

509
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,381
We'll cross that
bridge when we burn it.

510
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:07,615
First of all...

511
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,158
we got to get some.

512
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,852
Here's your cover.

513
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,475
You're a mild-mannered reporter.

514
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,153
So, uh...

515
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:45,571
Butcher tells me he met you,
what, a few days ago?

516
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,072
Yeah.

517
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,906
Yeah, that sounds right.

518
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,581
I don't know.
I've kind of lost track of time.

519
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,251
Talk about a baptism of fire.

520
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,829
I'll mic you up here.

521
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,208
So, Translucent, huh?

522
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,924
How the fuck
did you pull that off?

523
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,006
I don't know.
Just lucky, I guess.

524
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,644
Still. Must have been scary.

525
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,604
You want to know
what's really messed up?

526
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,895
Is, uh...

527
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,229
in some ways...

528
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,895
just right in that moment, it...

529
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,364
felt kind of good.

530
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,656
It's written all over your face,
Hughie.

531
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,911
What? How can you tell?

532
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,923
'Cause I know
how this job makes me feel.

533
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,626
When I had the detonator
in my hand, I felt, like, a...

534
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,038
I felt, like, a rush.

535
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,086
I get it.

536
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,009
- Like I felt alive.
- But that rush, Hughie,

537
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,589
is no different
than the shit A-Train shoots up.

538
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,845
Everything comes with a price.

539
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,065
The last thing
I ever said to Robin...

540
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:08,948
was "Don't you ever
besmirch Billy Joel."

541
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,239
That was the last thing
that she heard

542
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,583
before she burst into pieces.

543
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:19,539
And-and I got to live with that
shit for the rest of my life.

544
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,131
The price?

545
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,636
Whatever it is...

546
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,758
I'll pay it.

547
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:45,441
This...
is the Race of the Century.

548
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,322
This... is our legacy
and our future.

549
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,372
Athletes achieving
at the highest level.

550
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:59,201
This is what we've waited for...
the showdown.

551
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,666
These men are extremely
powerful and very, very quick.

552
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,498
The Train is ready
to leave the station.

553
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,343
He reaches speeds in excess
of 1,000 miles per hour.

554
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,380
The fastest men in the world
are here in New York.

555
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,594
Who will come out on top?
There he stands...

556
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,304
six foot one,
but a stature that's such

557
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,215
that he's a colossus
for the whole world.

558
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,487
- All right, champ.
- Mmm.

559
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,909
You got this?

560
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,697
Yeah.

561
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,741
Hey...

562
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:41,865
Ma is looking down
on us both right now.

563
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,754
Putting that wind at your back.

564
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,882
Now, you got this?

565
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,799
- I got this.
- That's what

566
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,315
- I'm talking about!
- I got this. Yeah.

567
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,469
- That's what I want to hear.
- All right.

568
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,561
Introducing
the newest member of The Seven...

569
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,728
Starlight,
accompanied by Black Noir.

570
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,404
I'm tired of

571
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,650
the red tape
and the deep-state bureaucrats.

572
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,113
If the people want us
in the armed forces,

573
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,664
the people can order Congress
to do it.

574
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:20,408
Am I right? Yes!

575
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,750
Sorry I'm late.

576
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,506
You got room for one more?

577
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,589
Ravishing as ever, my sweet.

578
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,974
Hey, who's ready to see a race?

579
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,511
Huh?

580
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,516
Let's hear it for my boy
A-Train.

581
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,228
All right.

582
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,988
You fucking cocksuckers.

583
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,979
Please remain
standing for the singing

584
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,481
of our national anthem.

585
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,859
Thank you for coming.
It was nice to meet you.

586
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,075
Aren't you cute?

587
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,747
Is it okay if I get a selfie?

588
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,077
Of course, honey. Take this.

589
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,837
Look at you!

590
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,919
You really dress the part.

591
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,594
It's your old uniform, but
I'm saving up for the new one.

592
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,523
Hey, Starlight!

593
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,137
Show us your tits!

594
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,563
Come on!

595
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,152
- Come on!
- Baby!

596
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,520
Damn, baby, you look fine AF!

597
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,685
Lean down a little bit more!

598
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,574
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

599
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,361
You do not need to press
your luck right now, right?

600
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,865
Kick my ass, Starlight!

601
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,987
Sweetie, you know what?
Save your money.

602
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,115
I like that one much better.

603
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,917
- Starlight?
- I need a minute.

604
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,129
- Where's she going?
- Starlight!

605
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,522
Starlight, come here, honey.

606
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,716
Let's make some noise!

607
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,143
Glad you made it.

608
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,772
I had a feeling you might.

609
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:10,478
Remember when used to just
fly off to Paris, like,

610
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,650
- on a whim?
- Yeah, I remember

611
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,249
freezing my ass off
across the Atlantic.

612
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,034
Yeah, those were good times.

613
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,568
Why did we ever break up?

614
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:21,702
You mind if we not crack open
that tawdry little chapter?

615
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,790
Oh, come on.

616
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,750
You know...

617
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,172
Yeah, kiss her!

618
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,666
If I ever really thought

619
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:41,224
- that you'd fallen for someone else...
- Mm.

620
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,549
I just...
I don't think I could handle it.

621
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,755
- Is that so?
- Yeah, you and me?

622
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:47,096
- Mm.
- We're different.

623
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,770
We're better.

624
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,350
- Together forever.
- Okay, well...

625
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,823
Here comes the A-Train.

626
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,155
All aboard!

627
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,620
The Train is ready
to leave the station.

628
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,645
Ooh!

629
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,033
All right, Frenchie, find it.
You're in the clear.

630
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,366
Starlight! Starlight!

631
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,778
Starlight!

632
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,286
Starlight, over here!

633
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,205
Annie?

634
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,378
I love your new outfit!

635
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,837
Annie? Annie!

636
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,168
Annie? Hi!

637
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,592
Hughie?

638
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,011
From the bench the other day?

639
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,300
You're, uh...
you're Starlight.

640
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,604
That's...
How did I not realize that?

641
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,928
It's actually kind of comforting
that you didn't.

642
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,660
Fuckin' hell, Hughie.

643
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,203
You know Starlight?

644
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,187
Well, Hughie, it was...

645
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,000
It was really nice to see you,
but I should get going.

646
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,654
- No, Hughie, we need more time.
- Can I, uh,

647
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,323
buy you an overpriced beer?

648
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,821
You know, if you've-you've...
if you got time.

649
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,243
Throw in some overpriced nachos?

650
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,656
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

651
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,348
No V.
Must have hid it somewhere else.

652
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,096
Fucking find it, Frenchie.

653
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,308
This is just so weird.
I mean, the other day....

654
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,059
- Was it three days ago?
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,651
You just seemed, like...
You seemed so normal, you know?

656
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,517
- And now, it's just...
- Now, I'm a freak.

657
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,975
No. No, not at... No, that's not
what I meant at all.

658
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:07,066
I just meant... I just...
I wasn't getting Beyoncé vibes,

659
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,704
but... not that
you don't have that...

660
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,200
- I'm messing with you.
- Okay.

661
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,747
Bad news.

662
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,171
- No V.
- Great. We're fucked.

663
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,920
No, it...

664
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,802
It was really nice
to talk to someone

665
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,839
who didn't know who I was.

666
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:31,683
Once you're behind the scenes,
it's...

667
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:35,061
- it's different.
- Like how?

668
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,810
I don't know... if they really
want you to be a hero.

669
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,437
I think they just want you
to look like one.

670
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,991
The other day on the bench
when you were talking

671
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,834
about how much
you hated your job, you meant...

672
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,501
you meant this job?

673
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,877
Then, um...

674
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,587
...just quit.

675
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,262
Just walk away.

676
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,391
I mean,
you got nothing to prove.

677
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,017
I should probably get back,

678
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,230
you know, before they send
a search party for me.

679
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,821
- So...
- Yeah, totally. Um...

680
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:26,937
listen, Annie... Starlight.

681
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,485
- What do you, uh...?
- Annie.

682
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:32,278
Um, this is insane, but, uh...

683
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,664
I know you're you
and everything,

684
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,950
but if you ever
just wanted to...

685
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,834
you know, get...

686
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,871
Would you like my number?

687
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,171
Yeah. Yeah, that's-that's, uh...

688
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,173
that's what I was asking.

689
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,425
- Okay.
- Do I call you,

690
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,528
- or do I just commit a crime?
- Probably committing a crime

691
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,472
would get me
to you quicker, so...

692
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,352
There's a new young gun in town
and I'm ready to rock the show.

693
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,190
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:02,437
here comes Shockwave.

695
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,785
You all right?

696
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,327
Huh? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

697
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,712
I'm fast, baby.
Like, how I roll, you know?

698
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,709
You look wired as hell.

699
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,051
Well, it's just Mom's, uh...
Her spirit

700
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,065
is flowing through my body,
you know what I'm saying?

701
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:31,339
I've got eyes on A-Train.

702
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,683
He's totally jacked.

703
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,217
He must've shot up the V.

704
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,761
We missed it, boys.

705
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,076
I'm out of here.
I'll check in later.

706
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:01,248
Where the hell you going?

707
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:02,708
Just gonna see about a girl.

708
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,037
Ladies and gentlemen,

709
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:07,542
please turn your attention
to the track.

710
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,907
Please, clear the track.

711
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,629
Set.

712
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:03,682
Yes!

713
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,435
He's done it again!

714
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:08,017
A-Train wins!

715
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,563
A new world record for A-Train.

716
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,976
They say lightning
doesn't strike twice.

717
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,029
The world belongs to A-Train.

718
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:19,571
A-Train wins.

719
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,986
A-Train wins!

720
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:24,504
Stunning!
Absolutely stunning.

721
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,210
So, how the hell
do you know Starlight?

722
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,383
I don't really know her
know her.

723
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,512
Just, uh...

724
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,049
we met on a park bench.

725
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,554
Huh. You get her number?

726
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,476
Yeah.

727
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,438
Hughie?

728
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,689
Uh, yeah. Got it.

729
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,942
Good.

730
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:01,032
M.M.

731
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,204
Popclaw's eyeballing a vial of V
like it's made of Snickers.

732
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,013
What, you think she nicked
some of A-Train's stash?

733
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,765
That's exactly what I'm saying.

734
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,209
Get over here now.

735
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:12,999
Well,
you know what? Shockwave ran

736
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,924
a good, clean race,
but, uh, there can only be

737
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,923
one fastest man in the world,

738
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,715
and that's the A-Train, baby!

739
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,588
- Yes, baby.
- A-Train,

740
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,465
how are you celebrating tonight?
Any special girl?

741
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,523
Uh... well, you know me.

742
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,228
I'm always in the game,

743
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,558
but I'm too fast to catch.

744
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,693
I'm open to offers,
though, ladies.

745
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,281
There's plenty to go around.

746
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,502
A-Train, how have you managed

747
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,026
to stay on top all this time?

748
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,029
What's your secret?

749
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,031
Secret? There's no secret.

750
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,794
It's just about discipline
and training

751
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,157
and keeping your head
in the game, staying focused.

752
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,310
Fucking hell.

753
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,558
You said it.

754
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,191
She's been at it for an hour.

755
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,097
Come and get me!

756
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,686
How'd you know
to keep an eye on her?

757
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,612
Okay.

758
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,940
You see that red case
over there?

759
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,645
I've been around long enough
to know

760
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,355
a fix kit when I see one.

761
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,825
And she told A-Train
that V's a slippery slope.

762
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,537
So she's got experience.

763
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,096
I figured if you wait around
long enough,

764
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,830
two plus two equals nasty.

765
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,752
Sherlock fucking Homie.

766
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,540
Now admit it.

767
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,964
This beats babysitting
delinquents any day, don't it?

768
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:41,014
Fuck...

769
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,780
Oh.

770
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:06,155
- Hey, Popclaw.
- Mr. Lutz. Um...

771
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,699
- house call?
- I'm just here for the rent.

772
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,703
The rent you said you would pay?

773
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,575
You should come in.

774
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,042
You can wait there if you want,

775
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,228
but it's gonna take me a few
minutes to write the check.

776
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,212
I don't bite.

777
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,424
Unless you want me to.

778
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,343
That was a joke, Alek.

779
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,512
- Oh.
- Alek, right?

780
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,221
Okay, let's get that check.

781
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:29,181
You want a drink, Alek,
while you wait?

782
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:32,182
- You prefer Alek or Alexander?
- Alek.

783
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,345
It's actually short
for, uh, Aleksy.

784
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:36,064
I like that.

785
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,814
Sounds more exotic.

786
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,315
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

787
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,322
Like what you see?

788
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,236
Huh? No.

789
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:51,325
Yes.

790
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,119
I mean, it's... lovely.

791
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,583
It's okay.

792
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,253
A lot of guys
have a superhero fantasy.

793
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,803
Uh...

794
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,377
I-I'm sorry?

795
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:05,592
I mean, I... I mean...

796
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,559
- You know...
- Hmm.

797
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,600
...there is a world

798
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,653
where we could come...

799
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:23,066
...to an understanding.

800
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:30,618
Stop! In the name of the law.

801
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,038
Oh, no. Popclaw has caught me.

802
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,583
I am gonna sit right here

803
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,125
until the cops come.

804
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,049
You're not a cat burglar.

805
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,047
You're a filthy pig. Say it.

806
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,390
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

807
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,888
Say it!

808
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,157
I'm a filthy pig

809
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,521
who likes to eat ass.

810
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,637
Stay still.

811
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,814
You like to eat ass?

812
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,964
- He can't breathe.
- No, no, wait. Wait, wait.

813
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,628
Hold on. Hey, there.
Hey, there. Not so fast.

814
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,605
Oh, my...

815
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:50,026
You let that guy die.

816
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:51,781
And he didn't do anything wrong.

817
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:52,913
He was dead already.

818
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,239
That's bullshit.

819
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,043
So you can cross a street,

820
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,247
run up four flights of stairs
in ten seconds

821
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,287
like some Supe, can you?

822
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,002
And even if
you had've got there,

823
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,422
she would have clawed
your fucking head off.

824
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:09,051
Now we got her
right where we want her.

825
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,970
What? What?
What are you talking about?

826
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,008
You're a smart lad,
but you still ain't twigged

827
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,102
the one weakness they all got.

828
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,559
Their reputations.

829
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,602
Come on, Frenchie.

830
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,072
Like you said.

831
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:36,084
Whatever the price,
you'll pay it.

832
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,117
Right?

833
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,627
Easy. Easy.

834
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,340
We ain't here to hurt you.

835
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,100
We're gonna help you
sort out this little mess.

836
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,642
And all you got to do

837
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:07,766
is tell us everything you know
about this.

838
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:11,026
Who are you?

839
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:17,329
All right, I got your message.
Where is the fire?

840
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:20,946
No, no, not fire. Water.

841
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,495
Just ask my little guppy here.

842
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,041
You can show her.

843
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,217
Well, a very good friend of mine

844
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,717
- found this.
- It was a porpoise.

845
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,299
A fucking porpoise found this
at the bottom

846
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:38,675
of the harbor.

847
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,733
Go ahead, don't be shy.

848
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,742
Oh! Jesus Christ.

849
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,108
Is that Translucent?

850
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,324
Still think we got nothing
to worry about?

851
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,655
How did they even get through
his skin?

852
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,660
What kind of maniac...

853
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,502
Mm-mm. Not maniac.

854
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,539
Smart, actually.

855
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,673
Very smart.

856
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:15,011
Hey, Deep,
what can't I see through?

857
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,549
- Zinc, Homelander.
- Correct.

858
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,603
And what's the box made of,
Deep?

859
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,765
- Zinc.
- Correct again.

860
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,520
They also knew
that we'd find Translucent...

861
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,363
what's left of him...
eventually.

862
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,569
So they were just buying time.

863
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,399
Why do you say that?

864
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,574
I'm so glad you asked.

865
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,132
Whoever it was...

866
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,589
they just declared war.
