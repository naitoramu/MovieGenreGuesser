1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,680
In concentration camps,

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,200
respect is a given.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Well, here's it's going to be the same.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,040
You're going to dig the tunnel

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,920
until your hands bleed!

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,360
At night

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
you may cry in pain

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,240
in your cot,

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,600
but you will keep on digging!

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,760
You'll be on shifts without rest.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,680
Otherwise, an epic punishment awaits you.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,560
Just like your leader.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,880
A man who will kill
if he betrays us again.

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,680
Who will kill if he ever
yearns for freedom again.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,760
Whose sweat,

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
kills.

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,040
A man of explosive nature.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,440
Now they're going to be scared of you,
Arturo.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,080
Although we've always known
you're "the bomb".

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,960
You're an outcast,
so you'll stay here, secluded.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,520
Helsinki and everyone else, to the tunnel!

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,440
Come on, let's go!

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,520
Let's go, quickly!

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,480
Seismographs detected
unusual activity underneath the factory.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,520
The kidnappers have
increased the digging pace of the tunnel.

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,960
They'll finish it soon.

27
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,800
TUESDAY 05:41 PM

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,760
How much is left?

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
HOUR 103 OF THE HEIST

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,840
Two meters, according to the GPR.
Two and a half meters.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,040
Where are they exiting?

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,160
We think right here.

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,440
In a drainpipe 15 meters
behind the building.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,280
Attention, everyone. I want you all ready.
Warn underground units.

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,640
I want 20 men guarding
that drainpipe now.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,440
You know what guilty people do
when they are taken to the crime scene?

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,520
They don't stop talking.

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,200
About weather, politics,

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
they make jokes.

40
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,760
Because they're nervous.

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,040
They can't stand the silence.

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,960
But you...

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,920
you don't say a thing.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,880
What do you want me to talk about?

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,440
Who are you?

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Sergio Marquina.

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,000
Sergio?

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,920
Salva,

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,000
the Professor?

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
The person who has kept

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,440
all the police, the CNI,

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,000
and the Special Forces in check?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,480
The man I've been talking with
on the phone for five days,

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,440
who I told what

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,880
clothes I wear and even
what color my orgasms are?

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,120
And which one are you?

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Why aren't your fingerprints
in the national ID database?

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,160
I stopped renewing my ID
before they went digital.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,920
When?

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,400
More than

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,760
twenty years ago.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
That opens up a world of possibilities,
doesn't it?

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Because no one is going to report
the disappearance of a man who

64
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,240
doesn't exist.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,600
It will make it easy for me
to burn your corpse.

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
Is that what you want?

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,280
To kill and burn me?

68
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,640
Yes.

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,840
I sure do.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,560
Look...

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,840
perhaps as an inspector,

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,880
I shouldn't tell this to the person
who organized the heist

73
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,760
at the National Mint factory.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
But as a woman...

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
as a woman

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,480
who has spent years
being afraid of everything,

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,080
everything,

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
who trusted someone,

79
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,320
someone who knew

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
how fragile and vulnerable she was,

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,840
who's been fooling her
from the fucking beginning!

82
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Then it wouldn't be that far-fetched,
don't you think?

83
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,560
You could have...

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
you could have approached me,

85
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
coaxed me,

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,840
planted a bug on me.
A fucking bug, goddamn it!

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,040
But no. No, you couldn't.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,360
Yesterday we were dreaming together.

89
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Shit.

90
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,040
Talking about the future. The future!

91
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
Who the hell are you?

92
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,120
What are you, some disturbed fuck?

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,160
It was all planned, Raquel.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,040
Everything. It was all...

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,080
I'm sorry.
It was all planned out...

96
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
except what happened between us.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,400
I don't know, I broke my own rules.

98
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,440
What?

99
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,480
I didn't consider that variable.

100
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,160
What the hell are you saying?

101
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,280
-What variable?
-Falling in love with you.

102
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
You really think I'll let you
go on with this crap?

103
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,400
Son of a bitch.

104
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
That I'll sit back
while you lie to my fucking face

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,680
as if I were a 15-year-old girl?

106
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm not lying, Raquel.

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,280
I fell in love.

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Say it again.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,880
Say it again.

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,760
I dare you to say it again!

111
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,280
Raquel.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,640
I fell in love with you.

113
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm so sorry.

114
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Fine.

115
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,520
Fine.

116
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,960
05:46 PM

117
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,560
Berlin,

118
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,960
I need to talk to you.

119
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
Of course. I'm the boss again,

120
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
I need my pups to feed me.

121
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,360
What exactly did the Professor say?

122
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
about Tokyo?

123
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,320
He said he would try to free her.

124
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,640
And how the hell is he going
to do that?

125
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Rio,

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
he's not doing it himself.

127
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,680
Who is?

128
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,600
The four Serbs who dug the tunnel
five years ago.

129
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,000
They're the wildcard for extreme setbacks.

130
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,920
-When?
-I don't know.

131
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,320
You feel her absence, right?

132
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,000
Those who stay always have it worse.

133
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,160
Instead, she will be

134
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,520
broadening her experience,

135
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
enhancing her senses,

136
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,280
entertained.

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,760
Would you take the deal from the cops?

138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
What does it matter?

139
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,160
What would happen if we got out of here?

140
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,360
Would we stay together?

141
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,320
Betraying your friends.

142
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,200
My friends with city names?

143
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,680
Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow, Denver.

144
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,360
I think my friends
with city names are really cool.

145
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,040
And I'll tell you something.

146
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,000
Try to hide

147
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,560
if you accept the deal,

148
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
because if I see you,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

149
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,560
Women are quicker to move on.

150
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,600
You should know, just in case.

151
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
Tokyo is hot-headed,

152
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
but she'll be back

153
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,800
and we'll be together.

154
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,520
I know it.

155
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,360
Sure.

156
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,600
Of course you will.

157
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
I've always thought that.

158
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,560
If you betray us and leave,

159
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,640
and you need to call me when you're sorry,

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
because believe me,

161
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
you will be,

162
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,800
you can call me at Alison's number.

163
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
I'll keep it on.

164
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,360
The cops will be listening
but who cares.

165
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
ACTIVE SIGNAL REPEATER

166
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,400
Suarez,
Alison Parker's phone has switched on.

167
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,600
Try hacking it.

168
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
Sealed camera, sir.

169
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,800
They're not calling or sending anything.

170
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
PAINTING AND RENOVATIONS

171
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,880
-What the fuck are you doing?
-God damn it!

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
This is convoy 727,

173
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,520
we're getting hit!

174
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,640
<i>Base to convoy,</i>
<i>we did not copy that, please repeat.</i>

175
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,280
They've got jammers.

176
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,160
God fucking damn it!

177
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,640
<i>My guardian angel had not forsaken me.</i>

178
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,360
<i>And I felt like I was</i>
<i>on the haunted house ride.</i>

179
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,720
It's a bomb!
What the hell is going on over there!

180
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
They set an explosive!

181
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,000
<i>A dark tunnel where you don't know</i>
<i>when you'll be startled.</i>

182
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,640
-We're fucked!
-Shut tup!

183
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,120
<i>But how fun!</i>

184
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
What's going on?

185
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
What the hell is going on?

186
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go, they're shooting!

187
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
-Shut the hell up!
-We're fucked, Perez!

188
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
Shut up, goddamn it. Let me think!

189
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,000
Zero!

190
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,440
Stay alert.

191
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,600
Okay. No, stop.

192
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920
Put the guns down or I'll shoot her.

193
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,360
Put the guns down or I'll shoot her.

194
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,440
If you shoot the girl, you die.

195
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,880
If you shoot me,

196
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
you die.

197
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,120
If you let go of the girl,

198
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,640
you live.

199
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,120
<i>If only every decision</i>
<i>in this world was that easy,</i>

200
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,760
<i>right?</i>

201
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,040
Rio.

202
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
Rio!

203
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,640
I noticed you didn't agree
with what Helsinki was doing.

204
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,360
You're not like them.

205
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,480
You're a good boy.

206
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,560
I have a son your age, you know?

207
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,280
The eldest.

208
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,840
He's a good boy too.

209
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Help me, please.

210
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,640
I want to see my son.

211
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,560
I found this machine to make passports.

212
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,720
-No...
-Monica,

213
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,040
listen to me.

214
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,640
You can do whatever you want.

215
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,640
What if you change your mind?

216
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,720
It would be great
for you to have a new one. Besides...

217
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,520
this is real. Is good stuff.

218
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,960
I know. I work here.

219
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,320
-It's easy. We make it...
-No, really.

220
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,680
if you don't want it, toss it,
or keep it as a souvenir..

221
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,160
It's just two minutes.

222
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
-Let's do it?
-Okay, fine.

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,920
Is it plugged in?

224
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,280
-Yes.
-Okay.

225
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
What name do I use?

226
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,280
-Agata.
-Agata?

227
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,840
-What's the matter?
-It's a porn star's name.

228
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,640
Agata is a hot chick's name.

229
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,320
If you were ugly, I would say,

230
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,760
-Felisa or Maricruz...
-Maria!

231
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,880
-Maria Fernandez.
-Maria Fernandez?

232
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,600
That's not a name.
Nobody's believing that. Trust me,

233
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,160
-I know.
-It's discrete.

234
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,600
Agata sounds expensive. It's classy.
Use Agata.

235
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,080
Here you go.

236
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,480
Thanks.

237
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,480
Write "born in Madrid"

238
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,440
and whichever year you want.

239
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,960
-We're making a passport.
-I see.

240
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,960
In case in the end,

241
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
she runs or...

242
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,600
comes with us.

243
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,840
Who do you think stole your gun?

244
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
Let's go outside.

245
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,120
Suarez.

246
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,320
<i>I'm calling from the National Court.</i>

247
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
<i>The convoy with Silene Oliveira</i>

248
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,240
<i>was expected 15 minutes ago</i>
<i>and it's not here.</i>

249
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
<i>We haven't heard anything.</i>

250
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,920
Keep me informed.

251
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,840
Gomez,

252
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,880
I need two units on
Oliveira's route to the courthouse.

253
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
She hasn't arrived.
I need to know what's going on.

254
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,320
Understood.

255
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,880
Put this on.

256
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,560
Only contact the Professor.

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,240
He'll say what to do.

258
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,440
<i>Never in my life had I felt so free.</i>

259
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,160
<i>But that time,</i>

260
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
<i>the Professor's plan wouldn't work.</i>

261
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
I know I let the pressure get to me,

262
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,560
I was wrong, but...

263
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
please,

264
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,320
I don't deserve this.

265
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
Please,

266
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm asking you,

267
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,000
if there's any dignity left in you,
please.

268
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,400
I can't breathe.

269
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,000
I can't breathe. Help me.

270
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,840
Help me,

271
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,320
please.

272
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,560
We're coming in.

273
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,840
Take your food and sit down.

274
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,200
One meter between each one.
Come on.

275
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,920
That's it, just like that,

276
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
joyfully.

277
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,800
Helsinki, say hello to little Arturo.

278
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,520
Something doesn't make sense.

279
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,480
They said that if I sweat too much

280
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,960
I would blow up,
and yet here they put me,

281
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,200
locked in this god-awful heat.

282
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,320
-In this dreadful heat...
-It's best

283
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,680
if you stay calm and quiet.

284
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,800
It doesn't make sense.

285
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,280
-What?
-The bomb, that's what doesn't make sense!

286
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,280
You think they are going
to risk me tripping or sweating,

287
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
blowing up the whole plan? No...

288
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,760
No, that would be insane.

289
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,960
-They don't work like that.
-Shut up.

290
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,400
They're trying
to psychologically terrorize us.

291
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,840
They're trying to scare us.
This isn't real.

292
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,120
It's a bluff.

293
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,520
I don't want to know, so shut up.

294
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm taking it off.

295
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,320
I'm going to take it off, I can't take it.

296
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,960
It's okay.

297
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,880
-If it was real we wouldn't be so close.
-Stop and sit down!

298
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,120
Who are you to tell us what to do, brat?

299
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,760
It's your fault
that we're all locked in here!

300
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
-My fault?
-Yes, your fault.

301
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,240
You are the director
and eight morons managed to slip in

302
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,160
like they owned the place.

303
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,600
Is there any mint
in the world that has been robbed?

304
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
Just this one, right?

305
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,640
Congratulations,

306
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,920
you've made history.

307
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,280
Now, please, don't blow us up,

308
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,600
and sit down.

309
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,640
Sit down.

310
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,760
<i>Headquarters, do you copy?</i>
<i>The van was hijacked.</i>

311
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,480
<i>-There's no trace of Silene Oliveira.</i>
-Copy that. Wait for instructions.

312
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,920
Attention, we have a fugitive!

313
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,560
Initiate Operation Cage!

314
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,480
<i>He wasn't there.</i>

315
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,920
<i>He wasn't there.</i>

316
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,800
<i>He had arranged it all.</i>

317
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,120
<i>He had saved me.</i>

318
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,200
<i>How could he not be there?</i>

319
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,400
<i>On that October afternoon after I escaped</i>
<i>they deployed Operation Cage.</i>

320
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,200
<i>It might ring a bell</i>
<i>from terrorist threats.</i>

321
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,680
<i>They cut off all the exits</i>
<i>to the city at once.</i>

322
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,040
<i>Everything collapses</i>

323
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,680
<i>and you're trapped.</i>
<i>You can only hide.</i>

324
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,680
<i>My problem was that</i>
<i>my hideout was the hangar.</i>

325
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,120
<i>And the person who had to</i>
<i>let me in was the Professor.</i>

326
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,240
<i>But I was never too good at waiting.</i>

327
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
What's that?

328
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,680
The only truth I know about you
is that you're a professional liar.

329
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,560
And call me paranoid,
but you won't lie to me again.

330
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
I can guarantee it.

331
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,960
Do you think I don't know that?

332
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,560
That I'm an idiot?

333
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Of course she stole the gun from me.

334
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,280
But changed her mind,

335
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,280
otherwise I would be in a fucking
box with Oslo.

336
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,040
She helped you. That's great.

337
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,040
But you don't have to make her
a passport or take her with you.

338
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,320
What if I want to?

339
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,880
What if I want to live with her
and raise her son?

340
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,560
You're going to be fucked enough
to be carrying more burdens.

341
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,000
Not a burden.
It's a girl who loves me and a child,

342
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,640
who is innocent.

343
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,880
-It's a mess you shouldn't get into.
-If I do, it's my choice.

344
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,800
Sometimes we try to help others
and end up sinking ourselves, damn it.

345
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
If I sink, I'll swim, like always, dad.

346
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,440
It's not like that, dammit!

347
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
I know,

348
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,560
I tried to help your mother
every damn day of my life.

349
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,560
Where's this shit coming from now?

350
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,520
Mama abandoned us.

351
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,480
Where's this shit coming from now?

352
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,760
We abandoned her.

353
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
She was going to be the end of us.

354
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,120
I put her in a clinic in Barcelona.

355
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
It cost 200,000 pesetas.

356
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,800
And in less than 24 hours
she showed up at my hostel

357
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,720
-high as a kite on smack.
-What did you do?

358
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,240
It was the fourth time.

359
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,440
I'd lost my savings.

360
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,520
What the fuck did you do?

361
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,000
She wanted to buy more.

362
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,920
I put her in the car...

363
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,400
and dropped her off at a roundabout
in Martorell,

364
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,600
next to a place where they sold smack.

365
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,800
I didn't wait for her.

366
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,960
I went to pick you up

367
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,320
to move out.

368
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,520
You left my mother at a roundabout?

369
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,480
That's why I got you into all this mess.

370
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,920
Because I don't want you
to live the life I lived.

371
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,320
I want you to be free.

372
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,400
-I want you to start from scratch.
-You don't abandon a mother.

373
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,480
You get her clean.

374
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,200
You had me believe she was a bitch.

375
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,880
I thought maybe I was to blame
for her leaving.

376
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
It was her or us.

377
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,240
I won't break your skull
because we need you to get out of here.

378
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
When we get out,

379
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
you and I are nothing.

380
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,120
Two strangers.

381
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,120
Denver

382
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,840
and Moscow.

383
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,240
Did you finish the passport?

384
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,400
Yes.

385
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
Denver, are you okay?

386
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,800
It's fine.

387
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,520
I used Agata in the end.

388
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,320
<i>I drove nowhere, frantically.</i>

389
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,760
<i>In a fraction of a second</i>
<i>I knew where to go.</i>

390
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,720
<i>The problem</i>

391
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,560
<i>was that it was the most</i>
<i>guarded place in Spain.</i>

392
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,960
Take a deep breath.

393
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,040
Are you nervous?

394
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,240
No, I'm fine.

395
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,760
You see those lines?

396
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,360
Every one of your lies will draw

397
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,560
some ugly curves

398
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,920
due to alteration in blood pressure,

399
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
heart rate,

400
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
breathing.

401
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,960
So don't lie to me

402
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,520
or I'll know.

403
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,960
Name.

404
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Sergio Marquina.

405
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,280
Place of birth.

406
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,960
San Sebastian.

407
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Did you know you would destroy Angel?

408
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,480
Yes.

409
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,400
Was it you

410
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,320
who caused his accident?

411
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,000
No.

412
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,520
Was it your idea to rob the Royal Mint?

413
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,440
No.

414
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
Whose was it?

415
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,480
My father's.

416
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,880
He died before carrying it out,
so it's kind of a homage.

417
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,200
The fucking apple story.

418
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,040
The fucking organic cider story

419
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,640
you told me in bed yesterday

420
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,720
was the story of the heist?

421
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,360
And I listened to you like an idiot.

422
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,080
You've been mocking me
since the beginning.

423
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,360
I was not mocking you.
Look at the polygraph, please.

424
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,400
Look at it.

425
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,240
My father had a sick child,

426
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,080
not a goddamn penny.

427
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,560
What would you have done?

428
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,280
He spent his time thinking about robberies

429
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,960
to pay for a hospital
in the United States.

430
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,440
Out of despair.

431
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,520
To save my life.

432
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,320
My life.

433
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,520
Because nobody,

434
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,920
nobody...

435
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,360
helped him.

436
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,240
And when he tried, he was shot to death

437
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,120
at the doors of a...

438
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,680
of a bank.

439
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,760
That's the truth.

440
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,960
I guess there are many ways
of understanding what is fair.

441
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Did you think I was an easy target
because I was an abused woman?

442
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,360
Yes, I did.

443
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,960
When you leaked to the press

444
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,120
my refusal to release
eight hostages in favor

445
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
of Alison Parker,

446
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,480
did you know I was going to be
publicly lynched?

447
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,240
That you were going to destroy my career
in front of my mother and daughter?

448
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,440
Yes.

449
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,240
Okay.

450
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,560
You slept with me just because

451
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,720
I'm the inspector in charge, right?

452
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,720
No.

453
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,160
You slept with me because
I'm the inspector...

454
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,480
-No, no.
-Stop lying to me, dammit!

455
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,520
I'm not lying.

456
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,840
I have to believe
you have feelings for me?

457
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,080
You don't have to believe anything.
Raquel,

458
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,040
it's what I feel.

459
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,120
I didn't expect it.

460
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,080
It happened.
And it happened to you too.

461
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,280
It happened to you too.
Why are we here if not?

462
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,240
Huh?

463
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,640
Why am I not in prison?

464
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,160
What the fuck is this?

465
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,920
Are you the crazy woman
from<i> Misery</i> or what?

466
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,800
It's something that we're both feeling.

467
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,320
Both, do you understand?
It happened to both.

468
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,840
Yes, Suarez.

469
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,080
<i>Inspector,</i>

470
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,240
<i>Silene Oliveira has escaped.</i>

471
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,320
<i>-</i> What?
<i>-Going to the courthouse.</i>

472
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,200
<i>She asked to testify before a judge.</i>

473
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,760
The convoy was hijacked by people,
apparently eastern European.

474
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,800
I've initiated Operation Cage.
I hope they haven't left Madrid.

475
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
<i>Ask the judge immediately</i>

476
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,120
to issue an international arrest warrant.

477
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,720
Cut off roads, ports and airports.

478
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,680
I want patrols on every border.

479
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,440
Tokyo escaped.

480
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,680
Was it you

481
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880
who freed a murderer
from a maximum security prison

482
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,000
while held here?

483
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,440
Actually,

484
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,280
I left everything ready
before meeting you at the cafe.

485
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,720
I apologize for receiving you like this,
but I just got here.

486
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,960
Radko, I'm so sorry about your brother.

487
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,440
You got it all planned in detail, right?

488
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,480
Raquel, I've told you everything.

489
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,760
I've come here
without resisting whatsoever.

490
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,720
And if I let you interrogate me it's...

491
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,360
because...

492
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,560
I wanted to be honest with you.
I can't take it anymore.

493
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,720
-The lying.
-Shut up.

494
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,920
-I didn't want to hurt you anymore.
-Shut up!

495
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,720
-This is a relief.
-Shut the fuck up, dammit!

496
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,320
I won't listen to you anymore.
Look.

497
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,680
From now on, anything you have to say,
you say it directly to the judge.

498
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,280
Get up.

499
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,360
Get up, dammit!

500
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,160
Move, move.

501
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Move!

502
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,880
Keep walking.

503
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,840
-I'm very sorry, Raquel.
-Keep walking!

504
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,960
I'm going to shoot you.

505
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,240
I'm going to...

506
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,240
<i>Have you heard the expression</i>
<i>"to enter the lion's den"?</i>

507
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,520
It's a call to Alison Parker's phone

508
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,560
-from an unknown number.
-Trace it.

509
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,960
-Yes?
-Rio?

510
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,560
It's Tokyo.

511
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
It's Silene Oliveira.

512
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,640
Record! Locate the call!

513
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,520
Where are you? Wait!

514
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
<i>They can hear us.</i>

515
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,840
It doesn't matter.

516
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,000
This is a love call.

517
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,600
<i>And the police enjoy love.</i>

518
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,160
<i>Listen to me.</i>

519
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,640
Remember the door my mother
used to draw when I was afraid?

520
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,040
What door is she talking about?

521
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,120
Yes, love. Of course I remember.

522
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,400
-What about it?
-I'll cross it.

523
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,080
<i>I'll cross the door to heaven,</i>

524
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,880
because my guardian angel isn't around.

525
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
In one minute.

526
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,040
I love you.

527
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
I love you too.

528
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,720
What the hell was that about?

529
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,760
It sounded like a goodbye.

530
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,840
<i>Attention. Unauthorized vehicle</i>
<i>entering the perimeter.</i>

531
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,600
Come on, everybody to your stations!

532
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,880
Hey, you!

533
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,240
It's her.

534
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,680
The door...

535
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,720
The door...

536
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,560
Shit, the door!

537
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,800
Hey, hey!

538
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Attention!

539
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,320
<i>It's Silene Oliveira!</i>

540
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,640
Tokyo is back!

541
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,840
Tokyo is back!

542
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,960
On the ground!

00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
We have to open the door, dammit!

544
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,920
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,560
<i>Attention, fire.</i>

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,920
Let's go!

547
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,200
No! We have to cover her!

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,120
<i>Kidnapper in range, fire.</i>

00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,400
<i>Take cover, behind you!</i>

Fuck!

00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,520
Fuck!

553
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,280
Moscow!

554
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,920
Moscow!
