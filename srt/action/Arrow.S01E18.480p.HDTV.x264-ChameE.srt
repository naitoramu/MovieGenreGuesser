1
00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:03,995
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:07,197
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,332
survive.

4
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:11,167
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,402
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,970
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:18,772
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:23,076
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:26,947
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,448
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,216
Mom?
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:32,185
I believe Sarah's
still alive.

13
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:33,788
You don't actually
have any proof.

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,789
I have proof.
Doesn't it look

15
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,190
just like Sarah?

16
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:39,192
I did manage
to find one thing.

17
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:41,795
Does that symbol mean
something to you, sir?

18
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:43,163
I want to get out.

19
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:46,132
Malcolm Merlyn.
I want you to kill him for me.

20
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:50,069
We have a traitor
in our midst.

21
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,438
He just made his last mistake.

22
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:56,542
Lawyers for John Nickels
spoke to the press today.

23
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:58,878
They say they're pleased
the D.A. declined to indict

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,413
their client on charges
stemming from the recent fire

25
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:03,015
in one of Nickel's buildings.

26
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:04,450
John Nickel
is one of the wealthiest

27
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:06,418
real estate developers
in Starling City.

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,120
He's also one
of the dirtiest.

29
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:10,288
That building
that burnt down last night?

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,258
Wiring was not up to code.
Maybe he didn't know that.

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,204
I guess he also didn't know

32
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,061
about the seven people
who have frozen to death

33
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:17,495
in his other buildings
over the past three years.

34
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,497
Yeah, he's a real
man of the people.

35
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:23,467
Not for long.

36
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:26,270
The D.A. ignores this,
and the police can't do anything

37
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,838
because all these slums

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,241
are in the Glades.
So tonight, Felicity,

39
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:33,477
we cross Mr. Nickel's name
off the list.

40
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,814
You ok with that?

41
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:39,049
The scene outside
of the courtroom

42
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:40,417
where Nickel was
released this afternoon

43
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,386
was not
surprisingly tense.

44
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:44,488
100 percent.

45
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,432
Hello?

46
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:32,334
Aahh!

47
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,253
He was just gone?

48
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,756
No! Not gone. Taken.

49
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,958
Looks like Nickel was on
somebody else's list, too.

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,027
After the fire last night,
it's not entirely surprising.

51
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:30,995
Felicity, I need you

52
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:32,497
to get me everything
that you can on Nickel.

53
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:34,132
Focus on his tenants,
and anyone who might have

54
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:37,069
filed a formal complaint
against him, or...

55
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,736
people that lost
something in the fire.

56
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:40,471
Well, it's going to be some
list. I mean, slum lords

57
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,206
aren't generally known
for their popularity.

58
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,476
Plus...
What?

59
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:48,110
Nothing, it's just--

60
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,518
you went over there to be

61
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,140
all, "grrr, stop being bad
or I'll arrow you,"

62
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,205
and now you want to rescue him.

63
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:55,507
I don't like the idea that
somebody dangerous is out there.

64
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:59,544
Somebody else.

65
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:02,680
Because typically...

66
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:05,115
They don't show
my level of restraint.

67
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:07,350
So you're going
to cross Nickel off anyway?

68
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:09,319
No.

69
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,454
I'm finding somebody else
who needs a talking to.

70
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,356
You're going out
there again, Oliver?

71
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:15,724
Why don't you go home and
be with your family, man?

72
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:17,259
That's when the work
is done, Diggle.

73
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,793
Ok, then I'll take
you out to dinner.

74
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:20,194
I'm not hungry.

75
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,028
I'm not asking.

76
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,701
Simple exchange.

77
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,402
You get us a way
off the island,

78
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:33,469
and we'll give you
the circuit board

79
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,836
so that your
missile launcher

80
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:36,337
isn't just
furniture.

81
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,871
You've grown up quite
a bit, Mr. Queen.

82
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:41,173
I'll give you that.

83
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:43,509
I can get you a boat.

84
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,744
But I need time.

85
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:48,480
You got an hour, Fyers,
and then you're never--

86
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:50,281
what?!

87
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:54,018
We understand it might take you
longer than an hour to get a boat.

88
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,954
What we mean is you need
to move with some dispatch.

89
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:59,857
Ah, Wilson, still
in command there, eh?

90
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,893
I thought your little pet
had staged a coup d'etat.

91
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:05,396
Just get us the damn boat.

92
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:09,799

Mmm.

95
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,726
Now you want
to stop?

96
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,528
Well, we don't all have butlers.

97
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,531
You know, some of us actually
have to answer our own doors.

98
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,933
Oh, the horror.

99
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,139
You look familiar.

100
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,074
Did I see you
on TV or something?

101
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,111
Probably.
I'm Thea Queen.

102
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:45,379
Yeah, right.

103
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:46,847
Did you get it?

104
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,182
Tomorrow night.

105
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:50,517
Joe wants us there
at 11 p.m.

106
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,653
He said to be
on time, Harper.

107
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,693
What's happening
tomorrow at 11:00?

108
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,194
You know, I'm actually
kind of focused on

109
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:02,496
what's happening right now.

110
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,764
Oh, ok.
Yeah.

111
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,471
No, no, Thea, don't!

112
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:15,308
Why do you have a gun?

113
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,377
Because I'm no good with knives.

114
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,380
Look, it's just a liquor store.

115
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:23,283
The guy's a creep.
Trust me, he deserves it.

116
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:26,586
Look, if it'll make you
feel any better...

117
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,023
I won't be armed.

118
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,692
But of course, the owner
won't know that, but...

119
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,595
I got you a job
at my brother's club.

120
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:38,231
You have choices.
You don't have to be a criminal!

121
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,234
I'm not talking about
phone bills.

122
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:42,569
I owe people.

123
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,838
People with much
bigger guns than this.

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,606
Look, here in the Glades,

125
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,542
this is pretty much
the only solution.

126
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:52,278
No, lots of people in the Glades
live honest lives.

127
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,479
Obviously not you.

128
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,249
You're just a waste.
No, Thea.

129
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,817
Thea!

130
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,519
I'm going to make sure
you get home ok.

131
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,754
Don't bother.

132
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,827
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:09,930
Yeah.

134
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:16,404
Yeah.

135
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:19,207
Hey, honey.

136
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,076
There you go.

137
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:24,545
Um, what's all this?

138
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:28,182
Well, you asked me to look into
your mother's leads on Sarah,

139
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:29,584
so I made some calls.

140
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:32,153
It looks like you did a lot
more than that.

141
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,189
Well, yeah, but you're the one
who said we should do this, Laurel,

142
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,725
so, you know, if there's even a chance
that your sister is--

143
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:38,226
yeah, but--
thank you.

144
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:40,396
Hi, sweetheart,
I'm sorry about the mess.

145
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:42,731
Quentin, I just got off the phone
with the consulate

146
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,434
in Phuket. The secretary there's
going to run Sarah's photo

147
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:48,275
against their database,
see if there's a match.

148
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,382
That's good work.

149
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:55,120
What?

150
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:57,223
Well, I guess I just
thought deep down

151
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:59,425
that you were going
to help mom...

152
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:02,461
accept things.

153
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:04,630
Things you and I
accepted.

154
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:09,602
Um...

155
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:12,438
Yeah, but...

156
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,540
You got to admit.

157
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:18,012
This girl, she looks
a lot like Sarah.

158
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,481
Sarah had that same cap.
The Starling City Rockets.

159
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,650
Your dad bought it
for her, remember?

160
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,454
Yeah, I remember.

161
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,456
Stranger things
have happened.

162
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:31,461
Yeah. I can see that.

163
00:08:37,503 --> 00:08:40,539
Hungrier than I thought.

164
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,576
Are you waiting for me to finish
before giving me the lecture?

165
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,247
Oliver, you've been
spending a lot of time

166
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:48,681
under that hood
the last couple weeks.

167
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:50,750
Keeps my ears warm.

168
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:53,286
And you made
this decision to, um,

169
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:55,221
avoid entanglements?

170
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:57,044
For their protection.

171
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,258
The people who get
close to me get hurt.

172
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:01,560
What's the problem?

173
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,362
Do you think
I'm losing my grip?

174
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:07,032
No, it's just the opposite,
really. You seem calm.

175
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,035
Scary calm.

176
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:11,437
I get that things didn't end well
with Helena, with McKenna...

177
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,440
With Laurel.

178
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:15,008
With Sarah.

179
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,677
The list goes on.
Yeah. But what do you do?

180
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,246
You hood up, you go home, you repeat.
It's not much of a life.

181
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:22,082
Well, the life that I'm leading
for myself right now

182
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:26,486
doesn't leave much room
for an actual life.

183
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,655
And I don't need one.
Wow.

184
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:30,557
That's a pretty bleak future
you plan on spending...with no one.

185
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:36,229
I'm used to isolation.

186
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:38,064
And that is exactly
what worries me.

187
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:40,466
You've been home
for 8 months, Oliver,

188
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:42,201
but I don't think
you left that island yet.

189
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,740
What the hell is going on?

190
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,511
Yeah?

191
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,213
Found Nickel. Click
the link I just sent you.

192
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:55,482
This came up on every screen
with an I.P. address

193
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,317
originating from the Glades.

194
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:01,188
If you make
the Glades your home,

195
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,656
you know who this man is.

196
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,558
John Nickel.

197
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,527
He owns your tenements.

198
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,530
Manages your slums.

199
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,633
Provides the leaking
roofs over your head.

200
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:15,235
The mold in your pipes

201
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,337
and asbestos in your walls.

202
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,709
Basically, he makes money
off our suffering.

203
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,677
But the police aren't
interested in helping us.

204
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,847
They may have let us down,
but I won't.

205
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:31,550
John, I want to give you
the chance to state your case.

206
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:35,387
Why shouldn't you
be punished?

207
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:40,558
I knew there was
bad stuff in my buildings.

208
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,461
Track him, Felicity.

209
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:46,197
I'm looking.
Ok, yes, I made a little profit!

210
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,100
At least they had
a place to live.

211
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:52,170
Without me, people like that
would end up on the street.

212
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:54,372
"People like that."

213
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:58,676
That's all we are
to guys like this.

214
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,282
Aaah!
Don't.

215
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:09,854
I find you...

216
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:12,623
Guilty.

217
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,814
There are plenty more
people who need to answer

218
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,839
for their crimes against us.

219
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:28,773
So...

220
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,008
Who's next?

221
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,027
Anything new?

222
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,622
This guy's definitely

223
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,357
got more than
a subscription to "Wired."

224
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,259
His website's protected
by some very serious encryption.

225
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,329
Well, use that air magnet thing,
 you said that it could trace--

226
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,420
Oliver! No offense.

227
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:45,398
Do I tell you how
to sharpen your arrows?

228
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,732
Spoke to my friend
at the NSA.

229
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:51,069
The website code matches a cyber
crusader who's been on their radar.

230
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:54,773
He hacks into fringe sites
under the user name "The Savior."

231
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,641
NSA believes he's a former
resident of the Glades.

232
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:57,976
Former?
Yeah, well, a year ago,

233
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:00,512
he hacked himself
right off the radar.

234
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:02,047
He erased all traces
of his existence.

235
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:03,148
So what happened a year ago?

236
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,583
We're back.

237
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:06,886
I have with me assistant
district attorney

238
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:09,956
Gavin Carnahan.

239
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,560
Now, DAs are supposed
to go after bad guys.

240
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:16,596
But this one can't even be
bothered to bring them to trial.

241
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:18,898
Like the ones who killed
my wife in a bodega.

242
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,067
Felicity...
I'm on it.

243
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,237
They said there wasn't
enough evidence.

244
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:26,606
You think the evidence
would have turned up

245
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:29,057
if she'd been killed
in one of Starling City's

246
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,643
nicer neighborhoods?

247
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:32,611
Emma Falk. Grieving husband
is Joseph Falk.

248
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,180
What do we have on him?
Not much.

249
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:36,748
42, former
city worker.

250
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,183
Department of transportation,
computer technician,

251
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,185
left his job when she was killed.
One year ago today.

252
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:43,254
No current phone,
no current address.

253
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:46,824
Gavin, you're a lawyer.
You're used to making a case.

254
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:48,626
So go ahead.

255
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:51,595
I'm going to give you
ten minutes to deliver

256
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:54,699
the closing argument of your life.
Come on.

257
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,533
I'm trying to get a lock
on his wireless signal.

258
00:12:56,535 --> 00:13:00,070
10 minutes to convince
me not to blow you away.

259
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,083
What did Malcolm want
with you last night?

260
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,153
A target for reprisal.

261
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:19,156
He wants justice, and he's not
going to stop until he gets it.

262
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,826
Besides, this is good.

263
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:24,662
I think your definition of good
requires an adjustment.

264
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,965
No, he came to me.
Which means he doesn't know

265
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:31,103
that we're responsible
for the attempt on his life.

266
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,772
Yet.

267
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:39,144
What are the chances
of Malcolm discovering

268
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:41,113
who paid the triad
to assassinate him?

269
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,738
I was very discreet.

270
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,183
I wired the money through
a shell corporation I own,

271
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:47,819
from an offshore account.
Offshore?

272
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:51,189
Good.
That's good.

273
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:57,195
I'm sending Amanda
to London for a few weeks,

274
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:59,197
just as a precaution.

275
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,701
Perhaps you should
do the same for your family.

276
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:05,237
There's nothing
I wouldn't do

277
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,706
to protect
my children, Frank.

278
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,527
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

279
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,762
Almost woman to woman.

280
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:33,165
I'm really busy
right now.

281
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,134
Ok.

282
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:43,540
Thea.

283
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,242
Sorry.

284
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:47,010
What's up?

285
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,713
I could use
some advice.

286
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:52,749
I'm sort of dating
this guy

287
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:55,918
who would definitely be
described as a bad boy.

288
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,488
And I figured,
as someone who's dated

289
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,856
like a gajillion
of them...

290
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,458
I haven't dated a gajillion.

291
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,928
All right,
guilty as charged.

292
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,732
You want my advice? Run.

293
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,100
As fast as you possibly can.

294
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:13,237
Yeah. See, that was my first
instinct, too, but--

295
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,739
Laurel?

296
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:16,607
The Chinese embassy's
on line two.

297
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,743
I'm transferring him over.

298
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,578
Chinese embassy?

299
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,913
It's just this case
that I'm working on.

300
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:25,717
But we are definitely continuing
this conversation later.

301
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:33,424
Thank you so much
for getting back to me.

302
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm trying to track down
a woman in the photo

303
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,325
that I emailed you.

304
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,799
You did.

305
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,334
Really?

306
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:51,208
And you're sure that
she's in the states now?

307
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:55,146
Do you happen to have
an address on her?

308
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,154
I got him!
Shut it down.

309
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:06,490
Can't. He has a firewall
protecting his wireless signal.

310
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,659
But he's working off an IPX
located at 23rd and Mira.

311
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:11,662
You want to hood up?
The middle of the day!

312
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:29,214
Look! Listen.
Listen to me. Ok.

313
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:32,851
I have 53 cases
on my desk right now.

314
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:35,754
I don't always have time
to take on every case!

315
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:36,889
How's Carnahan?

316
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,758
Not making a very
persuasive argument.

317
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,192
I'm almost there.

318
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:57,243
See anything?
I'm only on the first floor.

319
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,646
Just six more to go.

320
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:02,749
There aren't resources.
I tried.

321
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,284
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
Oliver, hurry.

322
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,824
Can't find him!

323
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:26,106
He's not here, Felicity!
What?!

324
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,174
I searched every office
on every floor!

325
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:31,244
He's not here.
Is this the right place?

326
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:33,880
Are you sure?
Yeah, I--

327
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:36,483
Oh, crap.
What?

328
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:38,719
How is this possible?!
This can't happen! He's--

329
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,622
Talk to me!
Wait.

330
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:43,224
He moved. Just north of you.
Ocean and Grand.

331
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,326
On my way!

332
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:58,939
I took on cases that were--that I
thought that I could...

333
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:00,940
Win.
Yes.

334
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,643
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,702
Gavin Carnahan,
I find you guilty

336
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,004
of crimes
against the Glades.

337
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,972
Don't do this!
Don't do this!

338
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:34,941
And I sentence you to death.

339
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:38,144
I'm at Ocean and Grand, Felicity.
That's just a vacant lot.

340
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:39,879
How is this possible?
This can't happen. He--

341
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,984
Find the right address, now!

342
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,321
He's...

343
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:58,834
Oliver, it's over,
Carnahan is dead.

344
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,512
Where's Diggle?

345
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:19,148
I asked him
to leave me alone.

346
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,118
In my loud voice.

347
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,191
This wasn't your fault.

348
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:30,827
I was the one who was supposed
to find Carnahan,

349
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:34,554
and I was the one
who sent you that bogus location.

350
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:37,524
I've never seen
anybody die.

351
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,827
Hey.

352
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,629
This is the thing

353
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,431
with what we do.

354
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,567
Sometimes we lose.

355
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,909
Maybe it is better
being alone.

356
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,178
I'm not seeing anyone
currently, but...

357
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,080
If I were,

358
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:00,649
I don't know how I'd tell him
about today.

359
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,234
Gentlemen. Welcome.

360
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:21,370
So happy we were able
to reach an accord.

361
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:23,539
Oh, good.
Small talk.

362
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,808
Are we going
to get on with this?

363
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,877
As you wish.
Straight to business.

364
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,612
The circuit board.
Where is it?

365
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,447
Somewhere safe.

366
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,316
So get us to the boat and then
we'll tell you where it is.

367
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:37,621
And of course you'll be honest
about its location.

368
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:38,955
Well, I wouldn't be.

369
00:20:38,957 --> 00:20:40,824
But this one's got
some strange hang up

370
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:43,360
about principles
and integrity.

371
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:45,629
I always imagined
as much.

372
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:47,865
Which is why I'd like to
make a counter proposal.

373
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:50,233
Men!

374
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,209
No!

375
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:00,845
No!

376
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:05,549
You will deliver back
to me the circuit board,

377
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:07,718
or I will kill
Yao Fei's daughter.

378
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:12,156
So I wouldn't leave.

379
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:14,491
I can't imagine
you want the death

380
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:16,126
of an innocent young
woman on your hands.

381
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:18,428
Not with your...
Principles.

382
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:24,968
Hey.

383
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:30,874
Hi.

384
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:33,577
I wanted to do
some research on my own

385
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:36,612
into the evidence
that you gathered on Sarah.

386
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:38,581
So I called my friend
from law school

387
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:43,219
who works at the Chinese
embassy, and...

388
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:46,256
The photo of the girl.

389
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:47,657
I found her.

390
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,161
I'm sorry. Can I--
can I borrow your phone?

391
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:52,529
I promised my fianée
that I'd call him before dinner.

392
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:54,531
My phone's dead.

393
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,667
Jen, these are my parents.

394
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,670
Hi. Nice to meet you.

395
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:03,908
Yeah, you, too.

396
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,110
I just told Jen
about this photograph

397
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:08,880
that popped up in this case
that I'm working on.

398
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:12,150
Is that you
in the picture?

399
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:14,419
Yeah. I spent six months

400
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:16,554
on an island
off the coast of China.

401
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:18,622
That was taken
in a small fishing village

402
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,924
called Zhengjiu.

403
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,160
It's Mandarin for...

404
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:24,629
Salvation.

405
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:33,973
Are you all right,
Mrs. Lance?

406
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:35,875
Yes, I--

407
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:37,343
it's just, uh,

408
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:39,712
you look like
someone I used to know.

409
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:58,831
Wow.

410
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,001
I was waiting for this.

411
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:03,736
Waiting for what?

412
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:07,273
The whole "You can change,
I can see the real you" speech.

413
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:08,808
Look around, Thea.

414
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,177
This is home sweet home for me.

415
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,745
You either starve
or you do things

416
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,447
that mean you're lucky
enough to make it to 21.

417
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,582
I can't accept that.
No.

418
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:19,285
You can't accept me.

419
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:21,721
Roy Harper?
Yeah?

420
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:23,456
Roy!

421
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,751
More on the story
out of the Glades.

422
00:23:47,753 --> 00:23:49,729
The kidnapper seems
to have another victim

423
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,931
and is broadcasting the feed
to his website.

424
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:54,000
A warning to viewers,
this is live footage,

425
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:57,037
so we're not sure
what we're about to see.

426
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:02,677
Meet Roy Harper.

427
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,214
Arrests for larceny

428
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:10,017
and robbery,
aggravated assault.

429
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,386
And yet you're out
on the street.

430
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:16,456
Another gangbanger
in the Glades running free,

431
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,959
like the ones
who killed my wife.

432
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:21,227
I'm grew up in
the Glades, too.

433
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:23,997
And it didn't turn me
into a criminal.

434
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,099
I know that kid.

435
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:27,133
- How?
- Tommy!

436
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,668
Tommy?

437
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:36,042
Oh!

438
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:39,444
Oh, God, no.

439
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,480
I didn't know where else to go.

440
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:43,581
You know him?
Roy, he's my friend.

441
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,984
And we were in a fight and
some guy came out of nowhere

442
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,218
and just attacked us!

443
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:49,229
He doesn't deserve to die!

444
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:51,898
I promise you,
he's going to be ok.

445
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,101
You stay here with
Tommy, all right?

446
00:24:58,274 --> 00:24:59,773
Hello?

447
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,441
Moira, it's Malcolm.

448
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:02,675
I've learned
a high ranking member

449
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,677
of the Triad
was just arrested.

450
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,579
Well, I should have
a word with him.

451
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:09,349
I already have.
He's agreed to find out

452
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:12,719
who hired his organization
to assassinate me in return

453
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,688
for a reduced
prison sentence.

454
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,623
By tonight, we should know
the name, or names,

455
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,691
of the people
who tried to kill me.

456
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:21,995
Good.

457
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:40,646
What are you doing?

458
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:42,248
So it's not Sarah
in the photo.

459
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,716
But she's still
out there, Quentin.

460
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:45,418
And I'm going to find her.

461
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:49,455
Look, I understand now

462
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:51,324
that neither of you
have the stomach

463
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,725
to continue looking for her.

464
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:55,562
And that's fine.

465
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:57,897
I'm sorry
I involved you both.

466
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:00,433
You know that I would cross
to hell and back

467
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,702
to bring her home,
but I can't!

468
00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:05,271
'Cause she's gone, Di.

469
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,273
No.

470
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,109
You got to let go
of this now.

471
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,712
No! I can't!

472
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:13,548
I won't!

473
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,351
How did you know
Sarah had her hat

474
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:18,454
with her when she
went on the boat?

475
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:26,129
You were so sure
that the girl

476
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,697
in the photo was Sarah.

477
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,568
Not because she was American,
but because of her hat.

478
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,372
Her Starling City Rockets hat
that dad bought her.

479
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,674
Mom.

480
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:40,510
How did you know
she took her hat

481
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,480
with her on "the Queen's Gambit"
with Oliver?

482
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,884
I saw her.

483
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:50,854
What do you mean?

484
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:55,291
I came home early that day,

485
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:59,162
and I saw her.

486
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:01,164
Sarah.

487
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:05,168
I saw her put the hat in a bag.

488
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,771
She was packing.

489
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:10,807
You knew she was
going with him?

490
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,144
I told her not to--

491
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:17,848
I told her not to do this,
not to you, Laurel.

492
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,684
But she said she was in love
and she had to follow her heart,

493
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:22,719
even if nobody else
thought it was right.

494
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:26,122
Just like I told her...

495
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:31,194
Just like I told her I once did.

496
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,797
So...

497
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,967
I let her go.

498
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:40,771
I killed her.

499
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:42,706
I...

500
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:48,378
I killed my daughter.

501
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,714
I killed her.

502
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:53,817
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

503
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,419
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

504
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:57,855
I killed our baby.

505
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:04,162
Anything?

506
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:05,830
I've been going through
all the video we got,

507
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:07,432
trying to see if there's
anything that'll tell us

508
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,667
where this guy is.
I got nothing, except a sound.

509
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:11,336
Buried in the ambient noise.
Almost rhythmic.

510
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,904
Here, I've isolated it.

511
00:28:12,906 --> 00:28:15,574
What is that?

512
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,710
Sounds like a car driving
over lane markers.

513
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:20,646
It's bigger than a car.

514
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:22,681
Bigger than a car.
What, a bus? Uh--

515
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:25,618
wait, I know this.

516
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
I know it.

517
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,723
Come on! Guys!

518
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:33,126
Felicity, show me a map.
Sights of the abductions

519
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,495
on where we've seen
the signal so far.

520
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:37,665
Right there, right there.

521
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,300
23rd and Mira.

522
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,836
Locksley and Adams.

523
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:43,705
Wells street down by CNRI.

524
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:46,241
Those are all subway stops!
Starling City

525
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:47,609
doesn't have a subway.

526
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:49,277
No, but they used to.
When I was a kid,

527
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,845
my dad used to take me down
to the Rockets game.

528
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:53,615
By subway. For 14 minutes,
I'd lean against the window,

529
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:54,683
feeling the rhythm
of the train moving.

530
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:57,252
That's how he did it.

531
00:28:57,254 --> 00:28:59,255
He was at 23rd and Mira,
but he was underground.

532
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:01,490
He used to work for the
department of transportation,

533
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,526
so that's why he knows
all the old subway stops.

534
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:04,794
That's why I couldn't
trace the signal.

535
00:29:04,796 --> 00:29:06,363
He was moving.
He was in a subway car.

536
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:07,531
Where is he now?

537
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,399
He's on the old
cross town line.

538
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:10,834
If he continues on this route,
he'll be at the Spring Street

539
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,236
stop in 15 minutes.

540
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:17,540
Let the girl go.

541
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:21,178
No deal?

542
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,147
Very well.
Kill her.

543
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,181
No!

544
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:26,849
No!

545
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:00,886
That was unexpected.

546
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:06,091
Fire!

547
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,467
Ahh!

548
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:18,169
Come on!
Come on!

549
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,175
Get her to safety! Now!

550
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:26,844
I'll only slow you down. Go!

551
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:29,246
Just go! You've got to go!

552
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:30,882
Go! Go!

553
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:33,751
Go!

554
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,778
It's happening.
I'll give you 10 minutes

555
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,647
to state your case, Roy.

556
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:06,615
So tell us.

557
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:10,285
Why do you get to live?

558
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:15,457
I shouldn't.

559
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,659
Just do it.

560
00:31:19,495 --> 00:31:21,897
Kill me.

561
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:34,158
Just go on!
Kill me!

562
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:39,097
You really don't care
if you live or die?

563
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:44,453
No one's going to miss me.

564
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:48,966
I'm just a waste.

565
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:51,669
Then we agree on something.

566
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:55,673
This world would be
better off without you in it.

567
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:07,852
We seem to have lost the feed.

568
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:10,283
We will stay on this story
and keep you up to date

569
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:11,602
on any developments.

570
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:31,810
Let the kid go.

571
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:34,846
You kill this kid,

572
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:37,448
you'll never get
an opportunity to change!

573
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,551
You can give him
a second chance.

574
00:32:43,354 --> 00:32:46,256
We're the only ones
who can save this city.

575
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,490
We can't stop now.

576
00:32:47,492 --> 00:32:50,326
We're not the same!

577
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:52,962
You've killed people
for this city, so have I.

578
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:56,633
What's the difference
between you and me?

579
00:32:56,635 --> 00:33:00,637
Emma never got
her second chance.

580
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:04,742
You have no idea
how lonely it is.

581
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:08,779
Joseph.

582
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:11,549
Joseph!

583
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:15,219
I understand
being alone.

584
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:16,854
But it doesn't
give you the right

585
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:18,890
to kill people
in cold blood.

586
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,658
He deserves it.

587
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,593
Just like the gangbangers
who gunned her down,

588
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,963
he's no different than them.

589
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:27,799
And now I get
to gun him down.

590
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,467
Don't do it!

591
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:18,294
Got to get going
to the airport.

592
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:21,096
That red eye to Central City.

593
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:25,468
I should be home in a flash.

594
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:33,977
Mom.

595
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:39,215
Call me some time.

596
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:41,184
I'd really
like that.

597
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,849
You would?

598
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,650
Of course I would.

599
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,854
You're my mother.

600
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:54,693
I love you so much.

601
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,861
I love you, too.

602
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:26,157
I thought you were
going to die.

603
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,959
That makes two of us.

604
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,165
I probably
look like a mess.

605
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,868
I'm going to go
to the bathroom and freshen

606
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,736
way, way up.

607
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,271

611
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:29,421
Hi!

612
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Hey.

613
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:33,939
I heard Thea's
friend was ok.

614
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,841
Yeah. That worked out ok.

615
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:39,278
This Roy...

616
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,014
is more than just
a friend, isn't he?

617
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:45,184
Bad boys.

618
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:47,252
Hook you every time.

619
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:49,688
Oh, I think, uh,

620
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,657
Tommy actually went home
for the night.

621
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:54,960
Oh.

622
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:58,129
You all right?

623
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:00,465
You seem like you're something
other than all right.

624
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:08,606
My mom, she showed up
in town this week

625
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:10,641
and she's been...

626
00:37:10,643 --> 00:37:11,975
What?

627
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:13,644
She had this crazy idea

628
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:16,280
that Sarah
was still alive.

629
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:18,582
She was so sure of it

630
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:21,518
that she kind of had me
believing it, also.

631
00:37:24,423 --> 00:37:27,125
But Sarah's gone.

632
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,261
Yeah.

633
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:32,030
I can't believe
she sucked me in like that.

634
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,099
You miss her.
I miss them both.

635
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:40,171
Thanks for listening.

636
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,107
Of course.

637

Want to have dinner, or...

639
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:52,952
coffee, I don't know.

640
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:56,622
Why?

641
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:05,965
I don't want to be

00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:21,045
♪ I want you to stay ♪

647
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:25,682
Slade?

648
00:38:27,184 --> 00:38:28,651
Circuit board's gone.

649
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,360
Damn. Fyers played us.

650
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:39,529
While he was
screwing us around,

651
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:42,899
his men were combing
the woods for it.

652
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:46,336
Now his missile launcher
is fully operational.

653
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:49,072
And he was never going to
let us off the island, I get it!

654
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:50,407
Of course he wasn't
going to help you.

655
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:51,708
He couldn't chance you
warning the mainland

656
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,643
what he has planned.

657
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:57,013
She speaks English.
Yeah, well, guess what.

658
00:38:57,015 --> 00:39:00,082
Neither one of us
have any idea what his plans are.

659
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,788
I do.

660
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:13,930
Thank you
for coming, Frank.

661
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:15,932
Meeting like this
is dangerous, Moira.

662
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:18,701
Particularly now.
Yes, I know.

663
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,102
Malcolm knows.

664
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,871
What?!
I had no choice

665
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:23,205
but to turn over
what I've discovered.

666
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:25,207
The evidence
of the wire transfer;

667
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,510
the money that you paid
the Triad to assassinate him.

668
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:29,379
The money I--

669
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:33,583
Moira!

670
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:34,952
Oh!

671
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:38,489
Mr. Merlyn thanks you
for your loyalty.

672
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:40,358
You've done well.

673
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,593
Now Chen's family
will share his fate.

674
00:39:42,595 --> 00:39:44,896
Chen betrayed us,

675
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:46,898
but his daughter
didn't.

676
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,401
Tell Mr. Merlyn
I want her to live.

677
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:51,437
Amanda nearly lost her
life in the Glades,

678
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:54,172
now she's lost her father. I think
she's suffered enough.

679
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,941
We must send a message.

680
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:58,643
We have.

681
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:00,444
We...

682
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:04,448
Very well.
Thank you--

683
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:35,614
Thea's friend is upstairs.
I saw.

684
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:38,383
You probably saw that they were
very happy to see each other,

685
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:39,985
if you know what I mean.

686
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:43,122
Which you probably don't
want to talk about,

687
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:45,791
because she's
your baby sister.

688
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:49,562
You ok?

689
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:51,197
I'm getting there.

690
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,232
Thank you.

691
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:56,535
Psst.

692
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,238
By the way.

693
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,842
If you ever need to tell
someone about your day...

694
00:41:04,277 --> 00:41:07,512
You can tell me.

695
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:20,226
What's that?

696
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,294
Felicity pulled it up.
It's an old map

697
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:24,096
of a decommissioned
subway line.

698
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:26,331
Runs underneath
the low rent district of the city.

699
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:35,340
I've seen that map before.

700
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,545
It was right in front
of our faces

701
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:41,746
the entire time.

702
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:43,681
My father, the other archer,

703
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:47,452
the undertaking,
whatever the plan is.

704
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:50,855
It's all connected
to the Glades.
