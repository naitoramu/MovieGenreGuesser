1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,330
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,956
Diaz has people everywhere.

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,754
<i>He controls
Star City's government,</i>

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,332
<i>its infrastructure,
and its police force.</i>

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,464
<i>Diaz went after this
instead of going after Curtis.</i>

6
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,092
What if these are all Diaz's books?
Everyone he has on his payroll.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,343
We could liberate the city.

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,015
Your digital sniffer,
can it read the drive?

9
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,224
If you get me close enough, for sure.

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,428
Diaz's base of operations is too secure,

11
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,021
we can't move on it
without losing people.

12
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,480
You want my help,
I'm gonna need you to say the words.

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,481
I am the Green Arrow.

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,951
Sentries are not responding.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,576
You know, somebody wanna tell me

16
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,283
why I gotta do everything
in this place myself...

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,330
Why don't you watch where...

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,044
You gotta be a special kind of stupid
to be coming back here alone.

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,501
I'm not alone.

20
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,413
Move, move, move!

21
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,207
- Clear!
- Clear!

22
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,497
- Clear!
- Where's Diaz?

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Where is Diaz?

24
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,548
No sign of Diaz.

25
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,171
- What about Knyazev?
- Same.

26
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,968
Precinct reported he's not there either.

27
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,921
<i>This isn't over yet.</i>

28
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,404
Diaz clearly has
a third base of operations

29
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,480
we don't know about.

30
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,240
Yo, hoss, masks?

31
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,283
Mr. Queen and I
have come to an understanding.

32
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,451
Even if we didn't,

33
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,325
your identity is hardly a well-kept
secret, Mr. Ramirez.

34
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,207
So you're done trying to throw us
in jail?

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,577
Everyone has immunity
from prosecution, Rene.

36
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,872
The FBI recognizes that Diaz
is the clear and present danger.

37
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,710
Better late than never, I suppose.

38
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,334
That immunity deal
does include me, right?

39
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,761
'Cause I'd really like to not
spend my rest of my life in prison

40
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,133
if I can avoid it.

41
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,509
How did Diaz know
we were moving in on him tonight?

42
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,809
We rounded up the SCPD,

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,103
but Diaz still controls
dozens of city officials.

44
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,556
Diaz has a list of all of them.
He keeps it on his person.

45
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,266
Once we take Diaz, we won't need a list.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,976
We need to interrogate
all the people we rounded up

47
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,357
and see if we can get one of them
to give up Diaz's location.

48
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,654
No, they won't give it up.

49
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,572
They're more afraid of him
than they are of us.

50
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,402
They also know, without corroboration,
Diaz, or this list of his,

51
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,031
we'll have to kick them in 48 hours.

52
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,286
Where's he going?

53
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,117
Probably to go talk to his guy
on the inside.

54
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,458
Anatoly.

55
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,635
<i>Big night for you, Kapiushon.</i>

56
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,384
How you turn FBI
from foe to friend? Hmm?

57
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,177
Same way you did me?

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,676
Where's Diaz?

59
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,762
Ah, he's been on the move ever since
he heard FBI coming to town.

60
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,351
When he settles, I want to know where.

61
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,149
Hmm, I'll try my best,

62
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,560
but he's not in very trusting mood
these days.

63
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,647
What?

64
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,861
Okay.

65
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,083
My sister, what you
Americans call high-maintenance.

66
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,755
You avoided the raid.

67
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,959
Yeah, I got hungry.

68
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,757
Therefore lucky.

69
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,801
Got dinner.

70
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,303
When I got back here,

71
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,894
FBI all over place like ants at picnic.

72
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,728
So

73
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,563
what is your next move?

74
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,353
You lost your army.

75
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,109
I made some new friends.

76
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,366
New friends?

77
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,786
The Longbow Hunters.

78
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,158
I thought those were a myth.

79
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,871
They're very real.

80
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,455
We're going somewhere
to mount our counterattack.

81
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,427
Be there in an hour.

82
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,269
Yeah, I love you, sweetie. Okay.

83
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,433
Bye-bye.

84
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,143
- Lyla?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,519
She, J.J., William and Zoe
are at the NORAD bunker.

86
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,650
But she would much rather be here.

87
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,193
We have enough backup.

88
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,781
A son needs his parents.

89
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,858
And yours doesn't?

90
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,743
I'm gonna see this through, Oliver.

91
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,030
I thought you might say that.

92
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,915
So I think you should dress the part.

93
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,091
I had a spare made up.

94
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,546
There's no rule saying there can't be
more than one Green Arrow.

95
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,765
I should have done this
from the beginning.

96
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,180
Oliver, our disagreement
was never about the uniform.

97
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,512
I know that.

98
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,394
I'd like to apologize for any part
that I played in it.

99
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,232
I really thought I wanted this mantle.

100
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,742
It means something.

101
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,037
You've made it mean something.

102
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,949
When our city looks at it,
it gives them hope, Oliver.

103
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,041
And it would be diminished
if there was more than one.

104
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,176
For everything along the way, thank you.

105
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,556
Hello. Excuse me.

106
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,312
Hello, everybody.

107
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,111
My name is Anatoly Knyazev.

108
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,988
And I'm here to turn myself in.

109
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,785
We also have costume parties in Russia.

110
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,075
- It's always great fun.
- What do you have, Anatoly?

111
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,617
Address for Diaz. He said to meet
him there in one hour.

112
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,329
But he's not going to be alone.

113
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,334
- He's bringing Longbow Hunters.
- The what now?

114
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,586
Three assassins that even
the League is afraid of.

115
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,627
Or they were because the last one
died out in the 1950s.

116
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,132
Or that's what they wanted
people to think.

117
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,463
We've got the FBI backing us.

118
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,765
Please tell me we're not afraid
of three guys.

119
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,763
- Hell no.
- Let's get ready to move.

120
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,560
I'll go tell Agent Watson.

121
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,692
Well, it's funny everything always
comes down to a signature

122
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,315
on a piece of paper.

123
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,067
Diaz's crimes are local,

124
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,815
which means the bureau needs
municipal authority

125
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,195
to operate in Star City.

126
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,402
Well, now you got it.

127
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,665
What is it?

128
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,834
Got a location on Diaz.

129
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,752
- This'll be over tonight.
- Excuse me.

130
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,748
- Hey, honey.
<i>- Hey, Daddy.</i>

131
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,463
So the relationship
between me and your daughter,

132
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,378
<i>it took a turn.</i>

133
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,840
I don't think she's, uh,
into me anymore.

134
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,808
- Listen to me...
- No!

135
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,063
You listen to me,
or Laurel dies a second time.

136
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,274
What do you want?

137
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,070
<i>For the Mayor to get the FBI
out of my city.</i>

138
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,822
Do it! Tonight!

139
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,533
Or Laurel's dead.

140
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,694
Go to hell.

141
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,293
What was that?

142
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,256
Nothing. You said you were ready
to move on Diaz tonight.

143
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,926
I'm ready to come down on him
like God's own righteous fury.

144
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,003
Do it.

145
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,849
I don't think your daddy
loves you anymore.

146
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,095
I think if you were the real Laurel,

147
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,639
he'd already be here.

148
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,854
- Go to hell.
- That's a witty response.

149
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,273
I was expecting better.

150
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,897
Do you know what the funny thing is?

151
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,734
You moved on me because of him.

152
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,747
You got yourself in this situation
because of him.

153
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,204
You could have skipped town,
but you came after me.

154
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,539
Were you afraid of what I was
gonna do to your daddy

155
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,915
when you were gone?

156
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,877
Huh?

157
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,845
Come on, baby, talk to me.

158
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,264
Talk to me!

159
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,388
We're on site.

160
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,311
The FBI has graciously given me control

161
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,263
of their Key Hole satellites,
which I gotta say

162
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,065
are a lot easier to operate
when they aren't being hacked.

163
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,521
All right, listen up.

164
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,695
Diaz may have lost his police force,

165
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,939
but we believe he still has
his personal security

166
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,695
and Quadrant muscle backing him up.

167
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,195
No warning shots. Let's move out.

168
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,214
If this is where Diaz
is planning on making his last stand,

169
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,795
I would have expected more guys
with guns.

170
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,839
Not seeing anything.

171
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,641
I'm getting a big thermal reading
from inside the northwest corner.

172
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,389
That's where we're headed. Stand by.

173
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,073
Son of a bitch.

174
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,373
- What is it?
- Laser trip wires.

175
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,829
Trip wires for what?

176
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,883
Triacetone triperoxide.
It's the thermal source.

177
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,093
Diaz was never here.

178
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,133
<i>It's a trap.</i>

179
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,269
Hang tight,
we're almost at your position.

180
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,520
Negative. If you go in there,

181
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,021
if anybody moves,
the whole place will go up.

182
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,819
If we can't move,
we can't get to the bombs.

183
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,862
- How we going to disarm them?
- I am working on that.

184
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,532
- Everyone else just get clear.
- We can't leave Rene.

185
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,029
No, there might be
more explosives rigged.

186
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,236
Just please get away from the building.

187
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,365
<i>You heard her. Let's go.</i>

188
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,781
Talk to me, blondie.

189
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,662
Tracing a radio signal
to the explosives.

190
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,203
In case Diaz gets impatient,
wants to set off bomb himself.

191
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,755
If I can piggyback off the signal,
I might be able

192
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,295
to fool the triggers into thinking
that you're not moving.

193
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,718
"Might"? You can't see this,

194
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,130
but there's enough explosives in here
to send us into orbit.

195
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,555
Pressure is not helping, Rene.

196
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,388
If the bombs can be triggered remotely,

197
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,720
Diaz can kill us anytime.

198
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,223
We're not making it out of here, are we?

199
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,786
Hey, peanut. It's Daddy.

200
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,246
No, everything's fine. I'm safe.

201
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,199
I just wanted to hear your voice

202
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,620
and tell you that I love you,

203
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,373
and I'm so proud of you.

204
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,088
You give my life meaning
every single day.

205
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,845
Yeah.

206
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,923
You're my everything, peanut.

207
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,968
And I need you to know that.

208
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,769
Daddy's gotta go. I love you.

209
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,519
I'll see you soon.

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,947
Okay. Bye.

211
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,987
Can we
get in through the roof?

212
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,038
Negative. Blowing the roof
will set off the TATP.

213
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,081
Stand by while I clone
the trigger frequency.

214
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,080
Hello.

215
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,632
<i>So I'm curious.
How many did I get?</i>

216
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,387
You betray me,
and I'm the son of a bitch?

217
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,173
<i>The ones trapped in there
with those explosives,</i>

218
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,975
they're gonna die in a blink.

219
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,719
<i>But you, Anatoly...</i>

220
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,562
I'm gonna make it last
for days with you.

221
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,066
He triggered the explosives,
but I'm bouncing the signal off

222
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,193
a bunch of satellites.
You have seven seconds.

223
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,616
Move!

224
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,038
Come on!

225
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,639
You okay?

226
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,323
Thought I'd check in on you.

227
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,496
I'm fine, hoss.

228
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,541
Agent Watson told me about
your call with Zoe.

229
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,703
I thought I was gonna die in that room.

230
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,337
I just wanted to say goodbye.

231
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,217
Tell her how proud you are of her?

232
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,341
There's not enough words
to say how much.

233
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,509
I feel the same way about you, Rene.

234
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,264
When I first met you, I...

235
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:22,856
I didn't think you were much more
than a thug...

236
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,446
...in a ridiculous costume.

237
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,157
No prize yourself, hoss.

238
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,995
I judged you.

239
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,866
For far too long, I judged you,

240
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,827
and that was a mistake.

241
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,921
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,084
I think that you're a good man, Rene.

243
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,005
I think that you're the type of man
that this...

244
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,890
This city deserves.

245
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,804
I know it seems like I don't give
a crap about what anyone thinks,

246
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,973
but this means a lot.

247
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,309
Yeah.

248
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,108
Guys, we have another problem.

249
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,405
I told Diaz to go to hell because
you were about to move on him.

250
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,865
It was deception.

251
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,042
He learned I was helping you,
and he manipulated me.

252
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,872
It means
we're right back to square one,

253
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,374
not knowing where Diaz is.

254
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,456
But now we have a way to find out.

255
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,923
You tell Diaz you wanna see Laurel.
Proof of life.

256
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,628
We follow you to her, her to Diaz.

257
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,180
You go in there guns blazing,
my daughter takes the first bullet.

258
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,884
From what Oliver tells me,
she's not actually your daughter.

259
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,685
And she's a criminal
that made her own bed.

260
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,265
This isn't a hostage situation.
Our objective hasn't changed.

261
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,604
- Oliver, please...
- We can keep her safe.

262
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,107
How? The first thing he'll do
when he sees you coming is kill her.

263
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,812
I think this is a risk we need to take.

264
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,817
Yeah? Would you be taking that risk
if this was our Laurel?

265
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,492
Or is that the kind of risk
that got her killed

266
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,740
in the first damn place?

267
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,921
What the hell do you want?

268
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,669
To give you a second chance.

269
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,758
When you told me to go to hell,
you know, I figured that you figured

270
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,555
your buddies were about to take me down.

271
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,553
Well, it didn't work out that way.

272
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,722
<i>So now we're back to where we started.</i>

273
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,230
You kicking the FBI out of here
in exchange for Laurel's life.

274
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,309
I need to see her first, proof of life.

275
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,985
<i>I'll send you the address.</i>

276
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,442
Listen, you better come alone

277
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,741
'cause if something happens
that I don't like,

278
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,654
something's gonna happen to Laurel
that you don't like.

279
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,507
Anyone ever tell you it's rude
to sneak up on people?

280
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,466
Diaz?

281
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,853
- He's gonna kill her.
- I won't let that happen, Quentin.

282
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,773
What about Watson, huh?

283
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,650
She doesn't seem so important to her.

284
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,693
Just let me worry about Samanda Watson,

285
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,114
and let me try to keep Laurel safe.

286
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,816
I don't see how you can, Oliver.

287
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,784
You can start by trusting me.

288
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,949
Please.

289
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,823
I mean, I've earned it.

290
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,330
We've known each other
for a very long time, Quentin.

291
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,455
- A lifetime.
- Yeah.

292
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,124
We've come a long way, you and me.

293
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,381
It's been getting better since
the first time you arrested me.

294
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,388
You know, I've always been curious.

295
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,008
How did you beat
that lie detector anyway?

296
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,386
It just comes down

297
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,513
to keeping a regular heart rate.

298
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,310
I had a pacemaker that does that.

299
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,767
I didn't know you had a pacemaker.

300
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,477
I got it after that Mirakuru business
a few years back.

301
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,484
The old ticker couldn't
take that pounding.

302
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,815
Yeah.

303
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,734
Truth be told, I don't know
if it could take it now.

304
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,946
Yes, it can. Okay?
Because you're tough.

305
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,243
Laurel is tough too.

306
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,874
So trust me,

307
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,459
and this will all work out.

308
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,649
You're supposed to
bring Laurel.

309
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,029
I give the orders.

310
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,526
He's clean.

311
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,533
You're gonna give an order as Mayor

312
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,455
to get the FBI out of here.

313
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,870
<i>And you're gonna do it
at a press conference.</i>

314
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,832
Satellite track is clean.
Audio signal is five by five.

315
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,128
Everyone get ready to move.

316
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,331
Not going anywhere until
we know where he's keeping Laurel.

317
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,836
Not our objective.

318
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,633
<i>You want me
to hold a press conference</i>

319
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,712
before you even let me see my daughter?

320
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,425
Do you have a problem with that?

321
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,216
I'm not doing anything
until I see her alive.

322
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,805
What the hell is he doing?

323
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,771
The FBI is tracking me by satellite.

324
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,190
They're gonna move on you
unless we move right now.

325
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,809
Now, take me to my daughter.

326
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,893
Son of a bitch!

327
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,229
Get him in the car.

328
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,816
All units, move now! Go!

329
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,617
- Can your satellite track him?
- I've lost him.

330
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,417
Your friend
just blew this whole operation

331
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,040
and our best chance to get Diaz.

332
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,913
And his daughter's still gonna die.

333
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,850
When this is over, I'm bringing your
friend Quentin up for obstruction.

334
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,769
Our immunity arrangement
doesn't extend to him.

335
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,347
- He was trying to save Laurel.
- Well, I'm trying to save this city.

336
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,182
The city your friend's
supposed to be the mayor of.

337
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,983
I can't believe he'd so something
so reckless.

338
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,778
Or stupid. He knows
Diaz will kill him and Laurel.

339
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,777
- What the hell was he thinking?
- He wasn't. That's the problem.

340
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,237
Before Quentin went to see Diaz,

341
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,080
he went out of his way to tell me
that he had a pacemaker.

342
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,702
And he's never told us that before.

343
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,705
So why would he say something now?

344
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,504
- You can track a pacemaker?
- You know I can.

345
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,628
Quentin knew that Diaz's man
was gonna frisk him for a tracker,

346
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,836
just like he knew that
Diaz wasn't going to actually

347
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,420
bring Laurel to the meet.

348
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:29,181
So Quentin had Diaz bring him to her,
knowing that we could track him.

349
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,512
How long would it take you to find him?

350
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,392
Give me a high speed connection
and a few minutes.

351
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,018
You wanted to see her,
now you see her.

352
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,895
I'm a man of my word.

353
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,615
Great. Now, let her go.

354
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,533
I just promised proof of life.

355
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,869
We'll see how long that lasts.

356
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,995
Felicity has Quentin's location.

357
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,876
It's an abandoned chemical plant
on the border of Pennytown.

358
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,082
We're gonna move out in five minutes.

359
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,166
I'll be ready.

360
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,217
The FBI's only objective is Diaz.

361
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,011
They're gonna do their best
to keep Quentin safe,

362
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,430
but they don't care if Black Siren
is collateral damage.

363
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,224
Your point?

364
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,560
My point, Dinah, is that

365
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,020
it's up to us to keep her safe.

366
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,892
I know that you have
put your vendetta aside

367
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,102
for the sake of the mission.

368
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,903
And you wanna make sure
I keep it that way.

369
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,196
I wanna say thank you.

370
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,656
It takes a very big person to not

371
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,367
seek vengeance for someone they love.

372
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,242
If I haven't always been sensitive
to that,

373
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,040
I'm truly sorry.

374
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,747
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

375
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,964
You know, the truth is,

376
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,510
I respect you more
than you could ever know.

377
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,802
You put together a team of heroes.

378
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,142
It's no small thing.

379
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,353
- I'm gonna go get ready.
- All right.

380
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,774
- Hey.
- What is going on?

381
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,159
What do you mean?

382
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,827
I mean, you've been giving
the "Oliver Farewell" tour

383
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,121
all round this place,
including giving John the hood.

384
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,657
You know, everyone's wondering,

385
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,078
what did you have to give Watson
to get her to give us immunity?

386
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,709
I'm just gonna go out on a limb here

387
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,130
and guess that it was giving up
being the Green Arrow.

388
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,046
- Sort of.
- You can't be serious.

389
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,804
What happened
to becoming your best self?

390
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,226
I don't know if I believe that anymore.

391
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,178
Oliver, this is who you are.

392
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,898
You can't let Watson
get in the middle of that.

393
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,270
She's not.

394
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,602
- It was my idea.
- What do you mean, it was your idea?

395
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,688
Uh, guys.

396
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:47,860
Uh...

397
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,825
Sorry to interrupt what looks like
a pretty serious marital moment,

398
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,243
but everyone's ready to go.

399
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,081
To be continued. Okay?

400
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,960
Showtime!

401
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,549
You're gonna get in front of the camera,

402
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,462
and you're gonna get the FBI
to leave Star City,

403
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,590
or your baby girl grows a third eye.

404
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,015
He's not gonna shoot me.

405
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,309
- You're willing to bet your life?
- Yes!

406
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,011
- Laurel.
- Yes, I am!

407
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,097
You got five seconds.

408
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,312
- Five.
- Don't let him take this city.

409
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,524
- Four.
- He's bluffing. He's lying!

410
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,735
Three! Two!

411
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,987
One!

412
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,825
No! Dad. Dad!

413
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,330
Stay with me. Stay with me, Dad.

414
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,962
Dad, stay with me. Look at me.
Look at me.

415
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,877
Stay with me.

416
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,217
Don't waste your tears.

417
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,099
Where I shot him,
it'll take a good chunk of time

418
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,426
for him to bleed out.

419
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,101
Laurel, you need to get your dad

420
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,228
to get on the phone

421
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,185
and get the feds to go back
to their swamp.

422
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,401
I'll show him some mercy.

423
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,201
Like the end of the movie
with the little dog.

424
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,321
What's it called?

425
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,328
I'm gonna kill you.

426
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,034
I'm not doing anything.

427
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,506
All right, we're gonna do this
another way

428
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,792
'cause I'm not gonna count.

429
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,510
Your daughter's brains
are gonna be splattered

430
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,931
on your face.

431
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,718
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

432
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:46,975
Are you all right?

433
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:52,981
FBI!

434
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,463
- Quentin!
- I got him. Get Diaz.

435
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,147
No.

436
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,452
We gotta get him to a hospital.

437
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,813
- Come on.
- I got you.

438
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,444
I need a chopper.

439
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,945
<i>Five minutes away. We're five...</i>

440
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,618
I don't have five minutes.

441
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,077
I agree.

442
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,033
You wanna shoot me?

443
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,161
Do it.

444
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,751
Right here.

445
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,089
See, that's your problem.

446
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,887
That's always been your problem.

447
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,841
He needs
a doctor immediately.

448
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:25,925
Yes, ma'am.

449
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,318
Enough.

450
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,500
This is my city!

451
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:57,003
You wanna stop me,
you're gonna have to kill me.

452
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,754
He's right, Oliver.

453
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,755
The movie with the dog.

454
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,803
- It's called <i>Old Yeller.</i>
- No!

455
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,856
- What did you do?
- I had to.

456
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,437
I had to end it.

457
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,062
You think that fall's gonna kill him?

458
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,363
A girl can only hope.

459
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,948
I had him!

460
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,364
We scoured every inch of the city
and trolled Starling Bay.

461
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,038
He can't have gotten far.

462
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,835
He was launched off a rooftop.

463
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,959
He shouldn't have been able to go
anywhere at all.

464
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,836
Diaz doesn't go down easy.

465
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,341
You seem pretty sanguine about it.

466
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,385
That wasn't a total loss.

467
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,932
Felicity reprogrammed this
with a digital sniffer.

468
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,051
I was able to get close enough to Diaz

469
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,761
to clone the drive that he wears
around his neck.

470
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,144
I got government officials,
city employees.

471
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,980
We can give you everyone on his payroll.

472
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,313
We can give you your city back.

473
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,533
But the fact that Diaz is in the wind,

474
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,326
it doesn't alter our agreement.

475
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,405
I know.

476
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,169
How is he?

477
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,247
He's septic. They're getting him
ready for surgery.

478
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,876
Rene is in there with him right now.

479
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,299
What about Diaz?

480
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,338
You're gonna be fine, hoss.
These docs are gonna fix you up.

481
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,638
Yeah.

482
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,384
- Do me a favor.
- Anything, hoss.

483
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,724
If this thing goes the wrong way,
and I don't make it,

484
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,060
don't call me "hoss" at my funeral.

485
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,146
You're gonna make it.

486
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,894
Yeah.

487
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,368
How's he doing?

488
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,199
Kind of macabre actually.

489
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,406
I'll give you guys a minute.

490
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,661
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,035
Hi.

492
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,419
What's the latest on Diaz?

493
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,843
Diaz... He got away.

494
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,336
How?

495
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,385
Doesn't matter. We'll get him.

496
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,266
We do have a list of everyone
he's been controlling.

497
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,056
FBI is rounding them up as we speak.

498
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,315
So we can take our city back.

499
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,392
Mmm-hmm.

500
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,945
- You did good, Oliver.
- Thank you.

501
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,989
It's not over yet.

502
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,401
It is for you.

503
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,578
Am I wrong?

504
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,665
I've been dealing with Samanda Watson
for months.

505
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,416
There's no way she was gonna help you
without strings attached.

506
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,591
But those strings,
Oliver, that's a hell of a sacrifice.

507
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,172
I had to look at the way
I've been doing things.

508
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,344
It's not working.

509
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,936
I lost my city.

510
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,225
I lost my team.

511
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,435
There's a penance for that.

512
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,563
It just seems a little drastic.

513
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,949
Coming from the guy who just took
a bullet for his daughter.

514
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,823
Quentin, I hope I took
the time to tell you,

515
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,079
uh,

516
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,786
you're a really good father.

517
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,292
So are you.

518
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,880
I had a good example.

519
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,510
Yeah, your dad was a good man.

520
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,680
I'm not talking about my dad.

521
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,653
I'm sorry, but we have to take him
to the OR now.

522
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,655
Well, um,

523
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,860
when you get out, everyone
will be here waiting for you.

524
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,158
Thanks, Oliver.

525
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,831
For everything.

526
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,118
Thank you for coming.

527
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,657
- How is he?
- In surgery.

528
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,618
The doctors, they're optimistic, but...

529
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,288
But I thought
you should probably be here.

530
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,965
Thank you.

531
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,843
This is probably really strange
for you, right?

532
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,016
A little.

533
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,726
Are you, um...

534
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,810
Are you like my Laurel?

535
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,905
Hardly at all.

536
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,483
How long is this gonna take?

537
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,903
How many times are you gonna ask that?

538
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,536
As many times as it takes to find out
how long it's gonna take.

539
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,673
Mr. Queen. It's time.

540
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:31,916
Time for what?

541
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,544
What is she talking about?

542
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,556
I'm sorry that I haven't
explained this to everyone.

543
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,402
There hasn't been any time.

544
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,193
There wasn't time to explain what?

545
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,735
- You're arresting us?
- What the hell are you doing?

546
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,321
- I thought you said we had immunity.
- You do.

547
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,829
- Thanks to him.
- Oh, my God.

548
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,374
It was the only way.

549
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,626
No, it's not the only way.
There are a million other ways.

550
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,087
The judge threw out his case.
You can't do this.

551
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,587
- I can. It's federal.
- Federal.

552
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,880
The Bureau is going to stay in Star City

553
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:20,965
until Diaz is brought in.

554
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,185
But only if Oliver agreed
to turn himself in.

555
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,557
What the hell is going on here?

556
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,356
Wait a minute. Just wait.

557
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:42,987
How's Quentin?

558
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,290
Mayor Lance seized during the procedure.

559
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,336
The surgeons worked to revive him.
They did everything they could.

560
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,962
But his brain was deprived of oxygen
for seven minutes.

561
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,923
He's gone.

562
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:02,965
I'm very sorry.

563
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,484
Unfortunately, this doesn't change
our arrangement.

564
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,853
Mmm-hmm.

565
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,113
I'm so sorry, Sara.

566
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,620
All of you please
take care of each other.

567
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,295
Ollie.

568
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,991
Transport's delayed.

569
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,451
We'll be transferring you
in a half-hour.

570
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,843
Okay, I talked to John.

571
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,842
We have a plan. We're gonna get you out.

572
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,798
- No, you can't.
- Yes, we can. We've done it before.

573
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,882
We got John out of...

574
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,808
We broke him out
of Langham Penitentiary.

575
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,306
Yes, we did.

576
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,273
They're transferring me
to a super-max, Felicity.

577
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,984
And even if I wanted to break out,

578
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,817
they would just arrest everyone,

579
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:42,815
including you.

580
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,412
I think that William deserves
at least one parent.

581
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,536
During your trial,

582
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,706
you said you didn't wanna go public
because you wanted a life

583
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,583
after the Green Arrow.
This is that life.

584
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,255
- You can...
- I wanted to stop Diaz.

585
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,551
And I wanted to save you
and William more.

586
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,757
Not everything went our way.

587
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,644
Quentin and...

588
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,689
That protective custody
that we talked about

589
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,611
for the two of you during my trial.

590
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,904
- No.
- Lyla's gonna handle everything.

591
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,204
I promise, just until Diaz
is off the board.

592
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,782
No, I refuse to believe
that this is the only option.

593
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,291
We won back the city.

594
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,454
We got it back.

595
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,337
I thought I lost it.

596
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,223
- You didn't do that alone.
- I know.

597
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,928
Diaz tried to kill everybody
close to me.

598
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,895
And I had to find a way
to protect everybody.

599
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,781
This was the way.

600
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,415
- Is William here?
- Yeah, he's outside.

601
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,492
He's...

602
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,374
He's scared. He's confused.

603
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,044
He's wondering how the woman
that he's known for less than a year

604
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,674
is suddenly his only parent.

605
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,175
Would you please go get him?

606
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,718
Yeah.

607
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,119
Buddy, how you doing?

608
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,005
I don't understand.

609
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,208
What's happening?

610
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,384
I'm gonna explain everything to you.

611
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,741
Mr. Queen,
why are you being arrested again?

612
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,123
I have voluntarily handed myself
over to the FBI.

613
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,041
- Can you comment any further?
- Yes, I can.

614
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,253
I am the Green Arrow.

615
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,961
<i>I realize that I've denied
that claim with the same conviction</i>

616
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,590
<i>with which I'm speaking now.</i>

617
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:56,475
<i>I have let good people stand accused
of things that I have done.</i>

618
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,930
<i>Roy Harper is not the Green Arrow.</i>

619
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,769
Tommy Merlyn is most certainly
not the Green Arrow.

620
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,905
These are two names
on a long list of people

621
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,987
<i>who have given so much</i>

622
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,363
<i>and sacrificed everything</i>

623
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,035
<i>in the name of my crusade.</i>

624
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,169
Some of them gave their lives

625
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,371
in the pursuit of one simple objective,

626
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,248
to save our city.

627
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,585
<i>Star City still needs saving.</i>

628
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,138
<i>Last night, we dealt our enemy
a critical blow.</i>

629
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,432
<i>But there is still work to be done.</i>

630
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,766
<i>So I'm looking to the people
of this city.</i>

631
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,938
<i>I'm looking to my allies, to my friends,</i>

632
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,894
<i>to my partners,</i>

633
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,072
<i>and I'm asking them to continue,</i>

634
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,113
<i>to keep fighting.</i>

635
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,112
<i>I'm asking them to complete our mission,</i>

636
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,624
to save our city.

637
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,263
I know you, Oliver Queen.

638
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,509
You're gonna die in here, sucker.
You're gonna...

639
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,139
Shut the hell up!
