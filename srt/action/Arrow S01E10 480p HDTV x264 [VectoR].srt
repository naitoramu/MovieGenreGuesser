1
00:00:00,623 --> 00:00:03,785
My name is Oliver queen.
For five years,

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:06,986
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:09,238
survive.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,056
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:13,609
Now I will
fulfill my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,745
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:18,698
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,950
To do this,

9
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,952
I must become someone else.

10
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:26,656
I must become
something else.

11
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:28,691
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:30,259
It's done.
And he won't be harmed?

13
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:31,911
Nor will he ever discover
your involvement.

14
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:33,863
You have my word.

15
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,833
You know Digs, when I confront
somebody on the list,

16
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:40,652
I tell them
they failed the city.

17
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:44,340
But tonight...

18
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:47,326
Tonight it was me
who failed.

19
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,774
Get that hose over
to the north face

20
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:04,109
or we're liable
to lose the whole block!

21
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:06,729
Danny!
Yes, Keith?

22
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:08,531
Getting a little smokey
out here, buddy.

23
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,534
Just clearing
the upper level.

24
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:14,186
Hey you, over here.

25
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:16,906
I can use some help.
I got a hot spot.

26
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:20,525
Hey! What--oh!

27
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:23,078
Ohh! What--

28
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:24,756
How you doin'?

29
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:26,525
Rehab going good?

30
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:31,196
Any news on Walter?

31
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:33,449
My contact at the Bureau
struck out.

32
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:35,767
Same with my guy
at Interpol.

33
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,936
They're both saying
the same thing.

34
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,655
Either my stepfather
doesn't want to be found

35
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:42,541
or someone doesn't want him
to be found.

36
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:44,410
It's been
six weeks, Oliver.

37
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:46,962
No contact
from the kidnappers,

38
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:49,465
no ransom demand,
no proof of life.

39
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,833
I hate to sound--

40
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,118
Dig...

41
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,389
We both know he's more
than likely dead.

42
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,643
What do you want to do?

43
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,344
I don't know.

44
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:05,347
Even my contacts in the Bratva
can't dig up a lead.

45
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,483
I wasn't talking about Walter.

46
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,972
Back at fighting weight,
looks like.

47
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:16,075
And last I checked,
there were more than a few names

48
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,410
to cross off in this book.

49
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:23,499
Those people aren't
going anywhere.

50
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,002
With Walter missing,
my family needs me right now.

51
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:32,708
, tell them
to bring the plane.

52
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,294
My people will be
here shortly.

53
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,012
Do you not
think it convenient

54
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:39,348
you captured me
so easily?

55
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,350
Go!

56
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:43,936
What?
Run!

57
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:16,493

59
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,593
And, Judge Hinkle is ready
to grant them another continuance!

60
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,395
So I said, hell, no.

61
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,046
This trial starts
right now.

62
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:30,715
That a girl.
Thanks.

63
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,404
Dad.

64
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:36,989
What brings you by?

65
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,391
I need to talk to jo.

66
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:43,078
Is everything ok, Mr. Lance?
No.

67
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:50,953
What's happening?
No.

68
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:52,871
Her brother Danny.

69
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:54,923
He was killed
on duty last night.

70
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,458
Jo, I'm so sorry.
No.

71
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,794
No, no!

72
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:01,180
I'm sorry.
No!

73
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:04,216
Jo, it's okay!
No!

74
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:07,319
Shh.

75
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,440
Mom?

76
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,960
Hey.

77
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,295
Hey.

78
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:36,949
I stopped by
the Big Belly Burger.

79
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:39,551
I thought maybe you, me
and Thea, have some take-out,

80
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,287
watch a DVD.

81
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,140
Thank you, sweetheart.
I'm not very hungry.

82
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,978
If you change your mind...

83
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,747
I've seen
the movie before.

84
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,249
Cut me some slack.

85
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,284
I've been gone for a while

86
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,336
and apparently I missed
the cinematic genius

87
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:17,206
that is Zac

88
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,843
Galafinak...is?

89
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:23,378
I mean, with mom,

90
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,297
when you and dad
disappeared,

91
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:28,183
she spent more and more
time at home.

92
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,887
Eventually stopped going
out altogether.

93
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,722
What snapped her
out of it that time?

94
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:36,358
Walter.

95
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,478
One morning,
he showed up

96
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,681
and, you know, when he gets all
British and stern-like.

97
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,950
"Moira, get dressed.

98
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:47,202
We're going out
for lunch."

99
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,538
And, I mean,
it worked.

100
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,039
Hmm.

101
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,326
You know,
I've been thinking.

102
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,745
Maybe Walter
wasn't abducted.

103
00:06:56,747 --> 00:07:00,215
Maybe he's having
some mid-life crisis

104
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:03,585
and he's with some
stewardess in Bora Bora,

105
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:05,337
and he's too ashamed
to call home

106
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,972
and say that he's okay.

107
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:08,774
Just because
we haven't heard from him

108
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:11,643
doesn't mean he's...

109
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,379
he's gone, right?

110
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,597
Right.

111
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,733
So what strikes me
is that this Vigilante

112
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:20,051
was actually
making a difference.

113
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,687
In the four months
that he was active,

114
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,072
assaults were down,
muggings down.

115
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:26,942
The murder rate
dropped by 16%.

116
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:28,777
So in a very
quantifiable way,

117
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,696
this man in the hood

118
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:33,015
had been a positive
force in this city.

119
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:37,302
So where has he been
for the past six weeks?

120
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:39,988
Looks like
everyone's disappearing.

121
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:49,264
Hey.

122
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,359
What's this?

123
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,644
It's--it's nothing?
It's nothing?

124
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:11,603
"Reasons I deserve a drawer"--

125
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,654
Okay, we're going
to table this

126
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:15,440
for a less
tragedy-filled day.

127
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,209
Yeah, and besides,

128
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:19,962
I don't think
we're there yet.

129
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:21,997
I should probably get that.

130
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,515
All right.

131
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:30,455
I need your help.

132
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:33,392
Jo, come in.

133
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,980
I, um...

134
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:43,151
I don't think what happened
to Danny was an accident.

135
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:47,022
I think he might
have been murdered.

136
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:54,813
Jo, do you remember
when Sarah died?

137
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:57,849
I did all this research to try to
find an explanation

138
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,851
for why the boat
went down.

139
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:03,505
I needed to believe
that it wasn't just an accident.

140
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:06,324
That is not what
I am doing, Laurel.

141
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,343
I once handled a case

142
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:11,963
for a clerk
in the Coronor's Office.

143
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:15,667
He passed me a copy
of the incident report.

144
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:19,638
Said that Danny's turnout coat
was doused in turpentine.

145
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,391
But I checked,
and the plant owner

146
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:24,559
said that there wasn't
any in the factory.

147
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:26,545
A turnout's supposed
to withstand temperatures

148
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:28,897
in excess of 500 degrees.

149
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,450
But the coroner said
that the fire

150
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:33,702
did not exceed 250.

151
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,020
How did my brother

152
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:40,058
burn hotter than the fire
that supposedly killed him?

153
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:47,499
Laurel, a fireman died
fighting a fire.

154
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,051
I'm not sure I see the crime.

155
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,869
I did some digging.

156
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:54,089
Last week, another firefighter,
Leo Barnes, was killed in action,

157
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:56,391
same circumstances.
Traces of turpentine,

158
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:59,428
and ignition temperatures hotter
than the actual fire.

159
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,213
Do you think that you could
talk to the fire marshal?

160
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:04,566
You know, encourage him
to pursue this?

161
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:06,985
Well, the fire department
has its own investigative unit.

162
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,353
They don't answer to the police.

163
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:10,238
Sorry it takes so long
with the detectives.

164
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,606
CSU's been
really backed up.

165
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,108
Well, did you find anything?

166
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,776
The only prints
on it are yours,

167
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:16,728
the tech inside
is military grade.

168
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,014
I can't even trace
the manufacturer.

169
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:21,083
Forensics-wise,
it's a dead end.

170
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:24,336
Another case?

171
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:26,237
Vigilante.

172
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,756
The phone belongs to him.

173
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:29,925
Where'd you get it?

174
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,626
I--does he answer?

175
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:36,298
Well, like Kelton said,
it's a dead end.

176
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,016
Listen, kiddo, I feel
for Jo and her family

177
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,468
I really do, but, um,

178
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,437
there's a lot
I can do this end.

179
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,973
I got to go. I love you.

180
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:47,275
Hey. Let's go.

181
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,109
Hello?

182
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,262
I need your help.

183
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,007
I didn't trust
that you'd come.

184
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,642
No one's seen you
for a while.

185
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:31,010
Where have you been?

186
00:11:31,012 --> 00:11:33,762
You said it was important.

187
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:36,198
My best friend's
brother.

188
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,351
He died two days ago
fighting a fire.

189
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,487
The police
and fire department

190
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,823
say that he died
in the line of duty.

191
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:46,525
But my friend,
she thinks he was murdered.

192
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,711
So you're asking
one killer to find another.

193
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:52,414
I heard what you said
to your father about me;

194
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,833
that I'm a killer.

195
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:55,835
That I have no remorse.

196
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:59,038
Do you?

197
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,990
Take a look
at the file.

198
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,392
If Danny de La Vega
was murdered,

199
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:06,078
then we have to bring
his killer to justice.

200
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,352
I'll look into it.

201
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:22,194
You need to rotate
your hips, Diggle.

202
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:24,513
That's where
the power comes from.

203
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,528
It's not just your arms, even if
they're the size of bowling balls.

204
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,414
Laurel reached out
to the Hood last night.

205
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,020
Really? Thought
the Vigilante

206
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:34,206
spooked her pretty
well last time.

207
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,543
She thinks somebody's
killing firemen.

208
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:38,961
It looks
all in the job.

209
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,713
Seems pretty thin.

210
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:43,716
Will you look into it?
Yeah.

211
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:46,385
I have a friend who has a friend
in the fire investigations department.

212
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:48,087
I'll reach out.

213
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,039
If you get any leads,
tip the police.

214
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,710
The police?

215
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:56,545
They just need something
to jump start them.

216
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:59,765
Well, isn't the whole idea
of being a vigilante,

217
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:02,067
is that you do
the police's job?

218
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,052
You know, Oliver,
you've been spending

219
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,154
a lot of time
around here lately.

220
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,822
I thought after six weeks,

221
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:08,857
you'd be anxious
to hood up.

222
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,911
Hell, I even prepared
the "you got to slow down" speech.

223
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:18,500
Let me see what's going on
upstairs in the club.

224
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,768
You know, I do realize
that it's difficult

225
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,353
for you to manage
my nightclub,

226
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:39,104
what with there not
being an actual nightclub here.

227
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,941
Yeah, I just took the liberty
of yelling at our contractor.

228
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:44,092
I told him if we didn't see
any real progress,

229
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:46,612
we were going to bring
someone else in to finish the job.

230
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:48,397
Good.

231
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,949
How's Laurel's friend?

232
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,817
The one whose brother
was a fireman?

233
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,268
She is hanging
in there, thanks.

234
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,653
I have something
I wanted to bring up.

235
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,288
I was thinking
that we could

236
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,407
throw a fundraiser
for the fire department.

237
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,042
Raise some money
for the families.

238
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,777
That's a great idea.
We could do it here.

239
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,879
We could keep
the overhead low,

240
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,915
make sure we maximize
the proceeds to the firemen.

241
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:10,002
Who are you?
Where's my friend Tommy Merlin?

242
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:12,921
The guy who once rented out
a pro football stadium

243
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:15,290
so that he could play
strip kickball with models.

244
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:19,144
That guy needed
a swift kick in his lazy ass.

245
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:23,816
Jo...

246
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:25,300
You really should
take some time off

247
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,152
and go be with your family.

248
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,521
You know, I seem to
recall when Sarah died,

249
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:31,991
you hit the books
pretty hard.

250
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:35,644
I am not exactly the best example
for healthy grieving.

251
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:38,647
Hey. Can I talk to you, please?

252
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,702
Where is it?

253
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:46,088
Where's what?
The phone.

254
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,706
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,425
I know I shouldn't have.

256
00:14:49,427 --> 00:14:50,992
It's stolen evidence!

257
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,177
Yeah, you probably shouldn't have.
What are you--

258
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:53,762
I had to do something.

259
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:56,331
That man's a killer.

260
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,166
Then why did he
give you his phone?

261
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,001
Give me the phone.

262
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:02,671
He took it back.

263
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:05,691
You were with him?

264
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,726
When Sarah died, if someone
could have done something

265
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:10,446
to give you even just
a little bit of closure,

266
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:11,980
don't you wish
that they would have done it?

267
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,365
If it meant
breaking the law,

268
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:16,702
lying to the people
closest to them...No.

269
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,077
Surely there are contingencies 
for these types of situations.

270
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,863
Bring someone over
from our London office, perhaps.

271
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:31,550
It's not solely a matter of the day
to day operations.

272
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:34,920
We have accountants
and the vice presidents to do that.

273
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,423
It's about perception.
Public confidence.

274
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:40,526
Ned, the company will be fine.

275
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:42,061
I don't mean
to be indelicate,

276
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:44,246
but this is
the second time

277
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:45,881
in five years
that the CEO

278
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,733
of Queen Consolidated

279
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,935
has vanished under mysterious
circumstances .

280
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:52,721
I don't need you
to remind me of that.

281
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:56,391
The last thing I want
to do is upset you.

282
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:59,778
Well, then you should consider
this visit doubly disappointing.

283
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:03,332
Good day.

284
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:11,290
Who was that?

285
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,758
Ned Foster.

286
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,259
The C.O.O. of the company.

287
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,345
He wants mom
to take Walter's place.

288
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:19,798
He says that the company's
stock price has been damaged

289
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,917
by Walter's absence,

290
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,038
and my stepping in
would help settle the board.

291
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,257
But I told him that I needed to be
at home, for my family.

292
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,843
Mom...

293
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,778
Thea and I are fine.

294
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,363
We can manage here
without you.

295
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:37,432
This sounds like something
everyone needs you to do.

296
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:40,936
Well, maybe I don't care
what everyone needs.

297
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:50,496
She's going to be
all right, Thea.

298
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:51,947
Mr. Queen, we're going to
have to get going

299
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,882
if you want to make
your dentist appointment.

300
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:55,300
Now, sir.

301
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,139
Eyewitnesses place
a '72 Ford pick up at the scene

302
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:02,508
of Danny de La Vega's fire.
Okay.

303
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,927
Stagg Chemical lit
up ten minutes ago.

304
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:06,962
I hacked into Stagg's video
security feeds.

305
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,847
Parked right on
the street running along the plant.

306
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,182
Same pick up.

307
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:12,851
I got your gear
in the car.

308
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,907
Oliver, by the time
I get someone on the phone

309
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,309
who will even listen to me,
at least one of those fireman

310
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:21,717
are going to be dead.

311
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:26,081
They need the man in the hood.

312
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:08,790
I have contact.
Two clicks southwest.

313
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:26,207
Portable one
to Deputy Chief Seven.

314
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,209
All clear of civilians.

315
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:30,879
Copy that. Bail out and wait
for second-in companies.

316
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:44,076
Who are you?!

317
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,305
Hello?

318
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,841
I have some information for you.

319
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,111
The killer drives
a 1970s Ford pick up.

320
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,981
There is a scar on his left wrist
from a severe burn

321
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,299
and a tattoo of a firefly.

322
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,635
Well, then you must
have gotten pretty close to him.

323
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:57,355
All the men
in Engine Company 15

324
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,106
had firefly tattoos.

325
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,775
Any one of them
could be the killer.

326
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:02,810
What should I do
with this information?

327
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:06,898
Whatever you would have
done before you met me.

328
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:11,669
Who was
on the phone?

329
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,071
Wrong number.

330
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:26,550
So Laurel's on her own
against a murderer

331
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:28,220
who burns people alive?

332
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,671
I can't right every
wrong in this city.

333
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:34,108
No, I get that, Oliver.

334
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,194
But maybe you're not back
to 100% like you thought.

335
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,681
Maybe I'm not.

336
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,026
What did that prove?

337
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:54,879
This is one sturdy desk.

338
00:21:56,531 --> 00:22:00,051
And clearly, your problem
isn't physical.

339
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,219
I never said I had a problem!
You didn't have to, Oliver.

340
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,505
But this guy,
the other archer,

341
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:06,540
he got in your head,
he took something from you.

342
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,259
That's enough.

343
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:10,210
He took whatever's
in your heart

344
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,046
that lets you
jump off buildings

345
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:13,914
and take down
bad guys.

346
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,683
Thank you for the analysis.

347
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,402
You can avoid Laurel,
Oliver, avoid me,

348
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:21,989
avoid this,
as long as you want.

349
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:25,225
But until you're ready to take
a hold of the fear that's in you,

350
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,662
you might as well
let that archer kill you.

351
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:33,334
Text from Tommy.

352
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,705
I need to run an errand
for the benefit

353
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,907
at the firemen's station.
Maybe while you're at it,

354
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,625
you can let me know
if you still want to be a vigilante

355
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:45,096
or just
a nightclub owner.

356
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,301
Hey.

357
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:52,386
What are you
doing here?

358
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:55,139
I told Joanne
I'd clean out Danny's locker.

359
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,423
And you?

360
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:58,309
Tommy sent me over
to make sure

361
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,144
the guest list for the firemen's
gala was accurate.

362
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,780
Tommy's been working
very hard on that.

363
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,281
It's very generous
of you, Oliver.

364
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,617
It's truly not.

365
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,153
Speaking of Tommy,

366
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:13,290
he told me that you're being
very protective of your drawers.

367
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,127
This is not a fancy term
for your underwear.

368
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:20,114
Are you and I seriously
having this discussion?

369
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:21,866
Well, we're friends.

370
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,634
Yes.

371
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,554
Tommy asked
for a drawer.

372
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:28,288
And this is bad?

373
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,341
No.

374
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,910
It's just...

375
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,547
I'm an all or nothing
type of girl.

376
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,566
First it's a drawer,

377
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,434
then it's a closet,

378
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,936
half my rent,
it's half my life.

379
00:23:41,938 --> 00:23:45,189
Am I really ready to do that
with Tommy?

380
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,391
You could take it slow.

381
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,860
I don't things slow,
remember?

382
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,146
I close my eyes
and I jump,

383
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:53,948
just like you.

384
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,034
I think that's why
we spooked each other.

385
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,504
Our feelings...
our fears, they control us,

386
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,506
it's not the other
way around.

387
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:06,093
You know?
Yeah.

388
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:09,163
I have to get inside.

389
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,835
There are eight firemen
in this picture.

390
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,554
I did some research.

391
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:20,007
You called yourselves
the fireflies.

392
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:22,342
Yeah, well, that station house
was shut down a few years back.

393
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,179
All the guys went
to different companies, so...

394
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:28,232
Four of these men
are now dead.

395
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,851
It's not all getting cats
out of trees, Ms. Lance.

396
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,154
But three of them died
within the last six weeks,

397
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:35,206
except for that man
right there.

398
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,908
Garfield Lynns.
He died two years ago

399
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,877
in the Nodell Tower tragedy.

400
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,662
Did you forget
something, Mr. Queen?

401
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:44,915
Just wanted to see if my friend
there needed some help.

402
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,367
What was
the Nodell Tower?

403
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:48,869
How do you not
remember that?

404
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:52,690
I was WiFi-free
for a few years.

405
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:56,393
It was 22 stories
of glass and steel.

406
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,259
Except it turned out
that the construction

407
00:24:58,284 --> 00:24:59,764
company who built it

408
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:03,350
used substandard materials
to save themselves a few bucks.

409
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:05,486
It was nowhere near
the structural code.

410
00:25:05,488 --> 00:25:06,937
Gas line blew.

411
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,672
There was a fire.

412
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,492
Yeah. Melted right through
the stanchions.

413
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:13,828
Whole damn thing came down.

414
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,412
Bad day.

415
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,114
34 civilians and six

416
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,183
of my fellow firemen died.

417
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,869
Do you need anything else,
Ms. Lance?

418
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:26,090
Other than reminding me of all
the friends I've lost and buried?

419
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:34,765
Hey!

420
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,051
What was that all about?

421
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:40,754
It was nothing, Oliver.
I have to go.

422
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,985
Hello?

423
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,555
Are you there?

424
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,624
I spoke to Danny's
old chief.

425
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,944
I didn't get anywhere.
What am I supposed to do now?

426
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:06,797
Nothing. It's my turn.

427
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:47,233
We have so many
of these old photos.

428
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:49,969
I really should
have them scanned in.

429
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:53,339
Well, that's an incredibly
ambitious plan.

430
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:55,091
Which will
have to wait.

431
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:57,259
Why?
Because we're going to go out.

432
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,128
To dinner
or to a movie

433
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,297
or shopping. Anything to get you
out of the house.

434
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:04,066
Ohh. No, Thea.

435
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:05,851
I'm just too tired.

436
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:08,804
Really, that's...
Pretty amazing,

437
00:27:08,806 --> 00:27:11,340
considering you've
been in bed all day.

438
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,754
Please don't presume
to think that you know

439
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:15,257
what I'm going through.

440
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:18,331
I do know.

441
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,801
I lost dad, too.

442
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:25,304
I'm worried
about Walter, too.

443
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:27,489
But I don't get
to worry about him,

444
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:29,925
because I'm busy
worrying about you.

445
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:31,493
I never asked you to do that.

446
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:34,046
Right.

447
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:37,917
'Cause you don't ask me to do
anything anymore.

448
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,902
You don't ask me
to do my homework

449
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,638
or to be home
at a decent hour.

450
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,607
I mean, you basically
stopped being my parent.

451
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,058
Well, how's this--

452
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,678
don't talk to your mother
like that.

453
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,698
Maybe you should start
acting like my mother.

454
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,002
So I don't have
to act like yours.

455
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:10,166
I thought you were done
helping Laurel.

456
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:13,552
The first firefly to die, his name
was Garfield Lynns.

457
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:16,589
Well, being dead kind of rules him out
as a murder suspect, right?

458
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,061
Oliver...

459
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:27,266
I'm sorry I came at you so hard, man.
But I've been there.

460
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,101
I know what it's like
to stare death in the face

461
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:32,354
and...be the one who blinks.

462
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:35,441
That's not it.

463
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:37,493
I've...

464
00:28:37,495 --> 00:28:39,762
I've been
close to death.

465
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:42,014
On the island...

466
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,783
More times than
I can remember,

467
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:47,837
and I never
feared it.

468
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,257
'Cause I had
nothing to lose.

469
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:54,176
But when that archer
almost killed me;

470
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:58,547
when I...
stared death in the face then,

471
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:00,766
I thought about
all the people

472
00:29:00,768 --> 00:29:03,719
that I've let into my life since
I've been back.

473
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:08,641
My family,
Laurel, Tommy.

474
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:10,576
And that made me afraid.

475
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:13,428
Afraid of what would
happen to those people

476
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,432
if they lost me--again.

477
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:23,689
And for the first
time in so long,

478
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:27,093
I had something to lose.

479
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:32,498
Well, you got it
backwards, Oliver.

480
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,135
You think the people
you let in are taking your edge.

481
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,120
I think it gives you one.

482
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:40,723
Maybe a stronger one.

483
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,508
You can stare down death

484
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,144
with something
to live for or not.

485
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:47,313
Something to live for...

486
00:29:47,315 --> 00:29:49,348
is better.

487
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,472
All the men in the unit had
an alibi for Danny's murder.

488
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:59,525
The guy that I fought
had a firefly tattoo

489
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,710
and his arm
was severely burned.

490
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:04,914
Okay. I don't see
where you're going with this.

491
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,029
The Nodell Tower fire.

492
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,266
Some of the bodies
were so badly burned,

493
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,890
they couldn't even be
IDed off dental records.

494
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,474
What if Garfield Lynns
didn't die,

495
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,143
but was just
presumed dead?

496
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,625
You know, ironically,

497
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,177
if we get any more
people in here,

498
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,328
we're going to violate
the fire code.

499
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:53,433
We're good on
drawer-gate, right?

500
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,501
All good.

501
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,558
Excuse me.

502
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,227
Can I borrow Laurel
for a second?

503
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,029
Absolutely.

504
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,203
Chief Raynes.

505
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,705
Hi. Mr. Queen,

506
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,707
this is spectacular.
Ahh.

507
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,577
The Starling City Firemen's
Relief Association

508
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,028
can't thank you enough.

509
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,880
You guys are
the real heroes.

510
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,550
Like at the Nodell Tower fire,
which I've been reading up on.

511
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,584
Oh, yeah?

512
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,169
Garfield Lynns
was the first man

513
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:30,387
to die in your unit.
Now, I read that

514
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,088
they recovered his coat
in the wreckage,

515
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,807
but they never
found his body?

516
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,727
You always interrogate
your club's guests, Mr. Queen?

517
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,429
Why?

518
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,481
Do you feel like
you're being interrogated?

519
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,733
You could see it
on your face at the fire station.

520
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:48,832
There's more to the Nodell Tower
fire than people know about, isn't there?

521
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,489
I've been doing this
a long time

522
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:53,825
and I've never seen
a fire like that.

523
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:56,994
It's like some monster out
of a science fiction movie.

524
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:59,414
I radioed for my men to get
the hell out of there.

525
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:01,798
But Lynns,
he wouldn't go.

526
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,050
Begged me to send
the unit back in.

527
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:06,435
But I wouldn't do it.

528
00:32:07,603 --> 00:32:09,970
I couldn't.

529
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:13,641
God help me,
I left him to burn.

530
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,394
But I can't bring him back.

531
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,196
You don't have to.

532
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:22,933
He is back.

533
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,804
What the hell
you talkin' about?

534
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:29,240
Garfield Lynns killed Danny.

535
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:31,158
And the other men
on your unit.

536
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,297
There's no way he could have
survived that fire.

537
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,177
You'd be surprised the power
revenge can give you.

538
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:41,045
Thank you so much.
The people in the city

539
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:43,497
appreciate everything you--

540
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:48,886
You're insane. Gar did not
make it out of that building.

541
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:52,506
Just like you won't
make it out of this one.

542
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,994
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

543
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:23,579
Go, go, go, go!
This way!

544
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:25,631
Gar, what the hell
are you doing?

545
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:31,294
Run.

546
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:32,961
Go!

547
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,972
Laurel?!

548
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:07,195
Laurel? Laurel!

549
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:09,314
Where's Oliver?

550
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:12,033
He's still inside!
We can't leave him.

551
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:13,818
Tommy!

552
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,377
You know how long it takes
for your skin to melt?

553
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,346
I do.

554
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:26,097
From experience.

555
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,665
I told you to get out of there!

556
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,217
And I told you

557
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,519
that we could
save the building.

558
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:33,521
But you got scared.

559
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:36,191
You lost your nerve.

560
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:38,276
You...left me in there

561
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:39,611
to die.

562
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,029
How did you get out?

563
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:42,814
I was pulled
from the wreckage.

564
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,483
Listed as a John Doe
in the burn unit,

565
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:47,736
in a coma
for months.

566
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:50,355
When I woke up
and saw

567
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:53,208
what was left
of who I was...

568
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,028
I only had one thought.

569
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,047
To leave you as alone

570
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:01,866
as you left me.

571
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,894
Now it's your turn.

572
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:30,946
Go!

573
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:32,280
It's over.

574
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:38,453
I'm not afraid to die.

575
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:41,089
I know.

576
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:44,342
You're afraid to live.

577
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:46,177
Let me get you out of here.

578
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:48,463
Lynns.

579
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,516
Let me get you out.

580
00:35:56,472 --> 00:35:58,356
Thanks.

581
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:05,030
But I'm already burned.

582
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,922
Eyewitnesses contend that numerous
lives would have been lost

583
00:36:25,022 --> 00:36:27,856
if not for the timely
intervention of the Vigilante.

584
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:30,308
But these were not
the actions of a vigilante.

585
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,312
What's been described
are the actions of a hero.

586
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:38,033
What's got you all smiley?

587
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:40,001
Your new club's a briquette.

588
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,369
It was under
construction before.

589
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:43,588
Now it's more
under construction.

590
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,041
Good morning.

591
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:48,076
Sharp suit, Mom!

592
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:51,329
Not used to seeing you without
your bedroom wrapped around you.

593
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:54,832
Well, I could hardly
go to the office in my pajamas.

594
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:57,502
I'm taking Walter's position
at the office.

595
00:36:57,504 --> 00:37:00,171
What changed your mind?

596
00:37:00,173 --> 00:37:03,725
Not what. Who.

597
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:06,010
My daughter.

598
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:09,698
My family.

599
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,683
And I promise you,

600
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:15,070
Walter will
get back to us.

601
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:17,622
I will keep looking for
him and I will find him.

602
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:20,024
And I'll see you
for dinner.

603
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:21,710
Mm-hmm.

604
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:27,465
What?

605
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:30,051
Just feeling the whiplash.

606
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:34,339
She went from shut-in
to chairman pretty fast.

607
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:36,591
Sounds like you got
through to her.

608
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:39,094
Yeah, I guess.

609
00:37:39,096 --> 00:37:41,813
It'll just be
for a few months.

610
00:37:41,815 --> 00:37:45,266
My mom, she's
taking it so hard.

611
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:49,053
Whatever you have to do
to take care of your family.

612
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:53,742
Before I forget...

613
00:37:59,165 --> 00:38:01,282
My brother's badge.

614
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,588
My mom was hoping

615
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:09,290
maybe you could find
a way to get it

616
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:12,410
to, you know...him.

617
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:14,629
As a thank you.
I don't care

618
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:17,432
what anyone has to say.

619
00:38:19,468 --> 00:38:22,687
He really is
a guardian angel.

620
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:28,259
I'll find a way
to get it to him.

621
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:34,098
I'm going to miss you.

622
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:38,369
Yeah.

623
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,660
Hey.

624
00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:46,777
Hey.

625
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:47,996
You look after yourself,
all right?

626
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:50,448
I will.
Good.

627
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:57,305
So Joanna's taking
a leave of absence, huh?

628
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:58,756
She has to go be
with her family.

629
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:01,009
Yeah, well, family's important.

630
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:03,561
I already apologized.

631
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:04,795
It's my turn.

632
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:06,481
After what happened last night,

633
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:09,651
maybe it's a good thing
you got the Hood involved.

634
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:12,970
He didn't take the phone
off you, did he?

635
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:41,716
Maybe you should
hold on to this.

636
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:46,688
I mean, I may not like
the guy's methods,

637
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,673
but whoever this guy is,

638
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:51,376
he's got a habit of putting
himself between danger and you.

639
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:54,345
And that's not something
I can argue with.

640
00:39:54,347 --> 00:39:57,732
Besides,

641
00:39:57,734 --> 00:40:00,451
I shouldn't
have this thing anyway.

642
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,542
Kelton. We good?

643
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:10,795
I got a strong signal
from the crystal vhf transmitter

644
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:13,464
you hid in the speaker,
and it can't be backtraced.

645
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:15,533
Talk to me like
I'm a third grader, please.

646
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,302
Next time your daughter
calls the Vigilante,

647
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:20,004
we'll be able to listen
to every word.

648
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:23,391
I know you swore
to bring this guy down, Detective,

649
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:26,377
but using your own
daughter as bait,

650
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:28,646
that's stone cold.

651
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:28,606
Good thing the fire
didn't spread to down here.

652
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:39,550
It's one of the benefits
of concrete and steel construction.

653
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:46,090
Thank you.

654
00:41:46,092 --> 00:41:49,293
What for?
You know what for!

655
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:52,347
So what's next?

656
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:54,899
More training?
No.

657
00:41:56,968 --> 00:41:59,237
We go hunting.

658
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:04,262
