176
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,838
I cleared it already.

177
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,007
You cleared what?

178
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,717
W-With Ashley at Vought.

179

Colonel, you think
the congresswoman is in danger?

189
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,406
She has her security detail.

190
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,284
Which will be useless
if a Supe drops in.

191
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,078
She's our best chance
to nail Vought,

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,914
but only if you keep her alive
until the hearing.

and give 'em a cup of iced tea?

321
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,922
-(laughs)
-And then punish us

322
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,924
-for trying to stop them.
-That's right.

323
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,551
Has there ever been anyone
in history more persecuted

324
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,179
just for trying
to protect their own?

325
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,555
(cheering, applause)

326
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,182
We are at war!

327
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,475
-CROWD: Yeah!
-We need more Compound V.

328
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,726
-Absolutely.
-Yeah!

329
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,355
-We need more Supes!
-More Supes!

330
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,773
-More Supes! More Supes!
-HOMELANDER:
We need more superheroes!

331
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,149
More Supes! More Supes!

332
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,568
-More Supes! More...
-Now,

333
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,779
I've always been honest
with you-- you know that.

334
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,322
And I got to be honest
with you now.

335
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,407
It brings me no pleasure
to tell you this,

336
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,410
but we also had
a mole in The Seven.

337
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,828
-(gasping)
-That's right.

338
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,247
One of our own.

339
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,290
(sighs)
Starlight.

340
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,500
(gasping, murmuring)

341
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,418
I know, I know. It's okay.

342
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,628
She's been apprehended,

343
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,713
and she can't hurt anyone else.

344
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,633
I can't believe this.

345
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,677
<i>Put 'em in.
All of 'em.</i>

346
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,845
<i>I want all of 'em in
at the same time.</i>

347
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,138
Okay, this is insane.

348
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,265
-Hey.
-No.

349
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,558

350
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,561

-Wait, wait, wait,

00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,204
-what's 42D?
-At the Tower.

360
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,747
Supe-proof, mostly.

00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,958
-Steel walls six feet thick.
-How do I get in?

362
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,626
Into the Tower?
Yeah, you don't.

363
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,919
And I'm sorry, man, but...

364
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,671
-she's probably dead.
-There's got to be something.

365
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,715
Right? Like a--
like a secret entrance?

366
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,009
Maybe one or two,
but forget it, man. It's crazy.

367
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,176
Okay, show me. Come with me.

368
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,678
Look at you.
You're still fucked up.

369
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,804
Which is exactly why
I need your help.

370
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,931
Get... your... friends.

371
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,099
Butcher isn't picking up,

372
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,517
and the others
are halfway across the state.

373
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,437
We got to go! Now!

374
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,356
Listen,
Vought screwed you over, right?

375
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,609
Well, now they're trying to do
the exact same thing to her.

376
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,361
This shit is over for me.

377
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,197
My whole life is over, okay?

378
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,825
This is your last chance
to be a hero again.

379
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,660
Come on, I mean,

Will you come with me?

Now, don't hate me.

00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,958
Why would I hate you?

Look, I'm sorry.
It was my idea,

393
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,097
but you wouldn't come
any other way.

394

Look, look, look, look, don't.

-Not my problem.

That's yours,
'cause you stayed with the cunt.

397
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,187
Have I ever asked you
for anything?

398
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,814
Ever?

399
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,036
William.

400
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,413
(chuckles)

401
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,456
Ah.

402
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,377
What, no hug?

403
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,379
You step one inch closer,

404
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,090
and I'll kill you quicker
than that fucking ass cancer.

405
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,801
I'll bet you would.

406
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,012
I seen on the news where you
topped that Stillwell slag.

407
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,681
It weren't me.

408
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,516
But thanks for your support.

Please, please.

411
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,438
I just want to talk.

412
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,404
Two minutes.

413
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,741
(chuckles)

414
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,411
(grunting)

415
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,163
You been following the Ashes?

416
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,749
You want to talk
about fucking cricket?

417
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,169
You remember the '83 World Cup?

418
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,171
I took you to every match--

419
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,297
Leeds,

420
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,673
Old Trafford.

421
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,175
You loved it.

422
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,428
Do you know why I loved it?

423
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,347
'Cause you'd get on the piss
with your loser mates.

424
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,350
And I could fuck off for hours
and you'd never know.

425
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,144
Yeah, well,
let's not do this then, eh?

426
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,437
Yeah, let's not.

427
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,106
I know I was no perfect father.

428
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,568
But I know I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny.

429
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,069
And I don't want that with you.

430
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,530
Didn't have a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny?

431
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,199
You're the fucking reason
he's dead.

432
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,534
Let me tell you something,
William.

433
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,578
It's a shit world out there.

434
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,372
You count on no one
but yourself.

435
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,374
You either sink or you swim,

436
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,043
and, in Lenny's case,

437
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,795
he chose to sink.

438
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,422
You don't have the fucking right

439
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,049
to mention his name.

440
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,469
I fucking loved Lenny.

441
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,888
But he wasn't hard like you.

442
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,848
That's why you're still here
and he's dead, isn't it?

443
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,893
You beat the fucking shit out
of the both of us, didn't you?

444
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,020
Maybe I pushed you a bit hard.

445
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,189
But look at you.

446
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,941
-Get the fuck off...
-You afraid of anything?

447
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,526
No.

448
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,611
Are you the strongest bastard
you know?

449
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,655
Yeah.
(chuckles)

450
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,243
Tougher than I ever was.

451
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,790
Oh, you're welcome, asshole.

452
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,295
(quietly):
Yeah.

453
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,923
Lenny stuck that gun
in his mouth

454
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,133
when you couldn't hack it
anymore

455
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,221
and you pissed off to join
the SAS like a right cunt.

456
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,139
You're the one
who abandoned him,

457
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,933
not me.

458
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,314
(grunting, choking)

459
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,691
You're a fucking monster.

460
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,817
It takes one to know one.

461
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,110
CONNIE:
Billy, for God's sake!

462
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,820
-Pack it in! Pack it in!
-(groaning)

463
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,238
Stop!

464
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,656
Jesus.

465
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,826
-Christ, what have you done?
-(chuckles)

466
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,328
See?

467
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,831
Lenny could never have
done that.

468
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,584
-(chuckles)
-Christ. Billy.

469
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,754
Jesus.

470
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,427
-(indistinct chatter)
-All right, guys.

471
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,387
-Sorry, we gotta go.
-All right, guys.
Thanks very much.

472
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,306
-Take care, God bless.
-God bless.
-(cheering)

473
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,599
I'm telling you--
it's a mistake.

474
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
What is?

475
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,810
Keeping fucking Starlight alive.

476
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,354
Hey. Yeah.

477
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,984
I underestimated her before.

478
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,569
I will not do it again.

479
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,988
"Starlight is a traitor"
is trending number one.

480
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,324
And we've got a million tweets
in support of Compound V.

481
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,242
A common enemy
rallies the base.

482
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,036
Just trust me.

483
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,871
All right.

484
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,082
And if I can get my hands
on Hugh Campbell,

485
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,209
maybe pull his little spine out
the back of his fucking neck...

486
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,922
You okay?

487
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,757
Yeah, I just, um...

488
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,884
HOMELANDER:
Your daughter?

489
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,887
Yeah.
(chuckles softly)

490
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,016
80 years ago,
she looked exactly like that.

491
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,644
Sometimes it feels
like yesterday.

492
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,611
I got something
I want to show you.

493
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,907
What to finish up the backyard?

494
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,452
Okay if I put
this person right there?

495
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,790
Hey, guys.

496
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,124
Hello.

497
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,376
This is Stormfront.

498
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,836
Stormfront, this is Rebecca.

499
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,465
Very nice to meet you.

500
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,134
And this is my son.

501
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,136
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

502
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,932
Listen, um...

503
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,767
I know, last time, uh,

504
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,436
I screwed up big-time,
and, um...

505
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,689
and I just want you to know
I'm never, ever

506
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,440
gonna push you
that hard again, okay?

507
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,695
All right, well, Ryan,

508
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,739
I'd love you to meet
my girlfriend, Stormfront.

509
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,658
Wow, he looks just like you.

510
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,076
HOMELANDER:
You think?

511
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,078
STORMFRONT:
Are you serious? Those eyes?

512
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,371
-(chuckles softly)
-Hey, Ryan,

513
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,289
your daddy told me
all about you.

514
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,543
-You have superpowers, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

515
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,838
That makes you
very, very special.

516
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,926
You are the first natural-born
superhero.

517
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,679
Can we not?

518
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,389
That's right. Um...

519
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,974
Ryan does have powers,

520
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,185
but his mom doesn't like
to talk about them or use them.

521
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,354
Can you also let me know
before you just pop by?

522
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,772
STORMFRONT:
He's Ryan's father.

523
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,024
He has a right to see his son.

524
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,109
Uh, that's very true,
but, look,

525
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,944
we all just have
Ryan's best interests at heart.

526
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,362
-Right?
-Yes, we do.

527
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,656
I'm really sorry
I haven't been here enough.

528
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,993
Ryan, uh, I'd really like you
to get to know Stormfront.

529
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,203
I would. She's someone
I care about very much,

530
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,413
and, um...

531
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,831
I think you will, too.

532
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,083
So, I think, uh,

533
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,501
we'll be around more.

534
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,545
A lot more.

535
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,340
I want us to be a family.

536
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,677
<i>(door opens)</i>

537
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,514

538
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,100
Empire Wok.

539
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,727
Hi.

540
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,107
That was a fraught "hi."

541
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,361
I'm going to my sister's
for a while.

542
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,576
I have a plan.

543
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,536
You don't need to be scared
of Homelander.

544
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,996
That little girl...

545
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,040
on the plane.

546
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,878
What she must have gone through
in those last few moments.

547
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,922
I lie awake every night
thinking about that.

548
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,132
-Me, too.
-But then I start snowballing

549
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,675
and wondering... (sniffles)
...how many other people

550
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,177
have you killed
and what else have you done?

551
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,387
-I didn't have a choice.
-I'm not blaming you.

552
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,848
I'm not.
It is not your fault.

553
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,643
Will you just--
Will you s-- will you sit down?

554
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,603
-And it's not fair.
-Will you sit down?

555
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,940
I wish I were as strong as you.

556
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,650
But I'm not.

557
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,611
I just need time.

558
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,990
(panting)

559
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,374
Over and over, you...
(sniffles)

560
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,294
You said
you wanted to see the real me.

561
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,383
This is the real me.

562
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,969
I know. (sobs)

<i>WOMAN:
Yes?</i>

568
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,945
I'm here to see Jonah.

569
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,573
<i>He's not taking any visitors.</i>

570
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,285
Tell him it's Grace Mallory.

571
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,797
Goddamn.

572
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,717
We're on the wrong team.

573
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,887
VOGELBAUM:
Moral compromise does have
its privileges.

574
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:31,888
Grace.

575
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,973
I thought you retired.

576
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,391
Dr. Vogelbaum.

577
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,642
I thought you were taller.

578
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,561
(laughs)

00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,897
Sonia, can you get some tea?

580
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,982
Thank you, but we won't be
staying long enough.

581
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,944
Ah, yes, there's
that WASPy patrician tone.

582
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,739
-All business.
-Doc, what do you know
about the Sage Grove Center?

583
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,157
Never heard of it.
Should I have?

584
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,576
Considering Vought's been doing
illegal tests there

585
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:54,994
since you were the CSO

586
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,746
and they're still doing 'em
to this day,

587
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,623
-seems like you should've.
-That's horrible.

588
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,918
Maybe it was Sonnenshine's
project over in R & D.

589
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,128
Prick always did have
a real god complex.

590
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,088
MALLORY:
Do you recall the deal we made?

591
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,132
In exchange
for me graciously dropping

592
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,551
certain involuntary manslaughter
charges?

593
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,220
I recall it was a long time ago.

594
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,764
Doesn't expire until
the statute of limitations does.

595
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,807
Then I guess
I'm turning myself in.

00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,267
(scoffs)

597
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,686
We don't have
to do this dance anymore, Jonah.

598

(exhales)

599
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,481
We're both out.

600
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,316
Just a couple of retirees

601
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,485
shooting the shit
on the back nine.

602
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,570
We both know Vought fucked you.

603
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,989
Probably put you in that chair.

604
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:34,951
Help us fuck 'em back.

605
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,411
Testify to Congress.

606
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,583
That's my daughter.

607
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,710
She took time off
from her practice

608
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,963
to help a bitter old invalid.

609
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,214
I'm sorry to say this, Grace,

610
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,632
but you're the very last person

611
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,717
who should be asking me
for help.

612
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,177
After what you lost.

613
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,598
Do what you like to me.

614
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,644
But some things are more
important than the right thing.

615
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,272

616
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,940

He's right, of course.

617
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,359
You should listen to him.

618
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,777
Ma'am?

619
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,612
Go back to your wife
and daughter.

620
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,948
Nah. I'd just be putting them
in more danger.

621
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,700
(laughs):
Ah, yes,

622
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,703
the self-martyring bullshit
of the special ops soldier.

623
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,289
I'll get you all on a flight
to Nicaragua.

624
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,082
No one sees you again.

625
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,752
When this is done,
I'll take you up on that.

626
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,088
But that's the point, Marvin.
It's never done.

627
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,090
You just let go.

628
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,758
No justice for your father.

629
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,010
No revenge against Vought.

630
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,761
You get nothing,

631
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,555
except your family.

632
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,058
Go and never come back.

633
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,728
I wish I had.

634
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,771

642
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,795
M.M.

643
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,174
Yeah, good.

644
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,551
How'd it go with Vogelbaum?

645
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,224
I'll take care of it.

646
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,354
CROWD:
Send her back! Send her back!

647
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,273
Send her back!
Send her back!

648
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,820
Send her back! Send her back!
Send her back!

649
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,615
Life has always been hard,
but I don't remember

650
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,784
it being quite this crude.

651
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,535
I get it.

652
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,913
What she's doing
with her daughter.

653
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,082
My papa-- when he...

654
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,292
lost his mind,

655
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,044
my mama, she...

656
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,587
she kept me cooking with her.

657
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,964
Cassoulet, confit de canard,

658
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,425
all the mother sauces.

659
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,513
Cooking has, uh,

660
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,474
this way
of giving port in a storm.

661
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,685
Did your...

662
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,438
your mama-- she cook?

663
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,025
You know...

664
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:17,279
Irvin Yalom-- he once said
you, you die twice.

665
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,698
Once, when you stop breathing,

666
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,118
and again when somebody...

667
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,662
utters your name
for the last time.

668
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,332
I'd like to hear
about your family.

669
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,127
Keep them alive a bit longer.

670
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,881
If you'd ever like to teach me.

671
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,722
Point is taken.

672
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,015
Never mind.

673
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,075
Gun?

674
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,035
I'm saying "gun"?

great news.

702
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,717
I've got a meeting
with Stan Edgar next week.

703
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,011
-Wow.
-Seriously?

704
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,514
With Congress up their ass
and all the shit with Starlight,

705
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,558
Vought needs trusted,
proven commodities right now.

706
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,477
-They need you two.
-Yeah.

707
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,604
Still got a few deal points
to talk through,

708
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,941
but let's just say, they should
be getting your rooms ready.

709
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,609
-For real?
-Honey, this is amazing.

710
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,236
-Wow.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

711
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,987
-You're welcome.
-This is awesome.
-(laughs)

712
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,658
By the way, what do you guys
think of, um, Eagle the Archer?

713
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,076
Oh, he's like a brother to me.

714
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,411
Yeah, he was there for me
when I was at rock bottom.

715
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,288
He's the most kind,
loving person that you ever...

716
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,416
He's a toxic personality,
and no Church members are

717
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,336
to have any contact with him
whatsoever.

718
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,505
Right. Yeah.

719
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:42,591
No, now that you mention it,
he did seem pretty toxic. Yeah.

720
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,385
Wh-What did he do?

721
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,680
Well, he claims
the program had failed him.

722
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,807
But actually
he failed the program.

723
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,475
-He doesn't exist,
you understand?
-Of course.

724
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,562
Ah. Oh, come on.

725
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,146

Hello?

743
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,501
What the fuck is this?!

744
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,837
This is not lesbian.
This is not on brand.

745
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,839

She's gone.

748
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,179
-What do you mean, she's gone?
-Elena's gone.

749
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,390
Okay. Okay.

750
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,684
Elena will be back.

751
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,647
She will be back in your arms,
and you will be totally fine.

752
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,483
You're America's second-favorite
lesbian couple, after all.

753
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,819
You know what? Let's just

we can talk about it, okay?

Ah, they're PG.
He can see them now.

-Yeah.

799
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,268
Did you know that your dad has

800
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,936
-his own roller coaster?
-Mm-hmm.

801
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,396
Do you want to take a ride

802
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,773
-on your dad's roller coaster?
-Can I, Mom?

803
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:26,857
We can talk about it.

804
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,358

805

(Homelander laughs quietly)

806
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,405
-I need to speak with you.
-Eh, we're having
a good time here, right?

807
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,448
Outside.

808
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,075
Now.

809
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,123
That's a great idea.

810
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,043
You two... stay here,
get to know each other better.

811
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,252
RYAN:
Okay.

812
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,840
I'll show you,
um, <i>Dances with Wolves.</i>

813
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,134
-I know what you're doing.
-Nope, you don't.

814
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,261
-Yes, I do. I-I can see...
-No, you do not.

815
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,765
You could not
possibly understand.

816
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,767
I was raised
the same way as him.

817
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,728
That kid doesn't know
anything about anything.

818
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,689
When he sees the outside world,
he's going to panic.

819
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,400
Now, that's gonna fuck him up.

820
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,238
I do not want my son to have to
go through what I went through.

821
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,367
His life...

822
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,410
-is different.
-(sighs)

823
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,830
He has a mother.

824
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,332
And I know that that means
something to you. I do.

825
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,668
And if you take him
away from me, this...

826
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,336
this whole world
will feel so confusing

827
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,880
-and frightening.
-Yes, but, Rebecca,

828
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:35,008
you... are lying to him.

829
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,386
Because I love him.

830
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,638
And I know a part of you
loves him, too,

831
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,431
and that you want
what's best for him.

832
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:46,019
But what's best for him is to be
here with me, with his mother.

833
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,313
Look, we have this opportunity

834
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,149
to give him a-a childhood
you never had.

835
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,360
We can do that
if he's here with me.

836
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,656
(voice breaking):
Please. I'm begging you, please.

844
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,884
a few surprise visitors today.

845
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,970
But you tell him
he's got one more.

846
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,014
The name's William Butcher.

847

850

But I can't give you

(chair scrapes loudly)

852

853
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,164
you or Grace came for, either.

854
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,468
What was he like?

855
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,802
Who?

856
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,554
Homelander.

857
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,015
Growing up as a lad,
what was he like?

858
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,643
(exhales)

859
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,478
I'm sure you don't want
to talk about this...

860
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,981
Oh, there is nothing
I want to talk about more.

861
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,568
And who knows better than you?

862
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,946
(sighs)

863
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,406
When he was a little boy,
five or six,

864
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,075
he was quite sweet.

865
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,620
He'd cuddle up to me.

866
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,873
He loved stories
about Davy Crockett,

867
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,833
Teddy Roosevelt.

868
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,504
Loved the idea of the woods,
the forest,

869
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,382
manifest destiny.

870
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,342
Well, you know,
I needed him to be

871
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,803
the strongest man in the world.

872
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,597
So I went to work on him.

873
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,599
He didn't even want it.

874
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,062
It was for me.

875
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,901
Hmm.

876
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,654
And that wasn't your only sin.

877
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,324
Was it?

878
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,372
It wasn't Homelander who hid
my wife away all them years.

879
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:14,084
It ever occur to you...

880
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:18,338
the pain you cause
sorry bastards like me?

881
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,509
At the time, it was barely
a blip on my radar.

882
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:29,599
Tell me, Doctor,

883
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,020
what's your radar
telling you now?

884
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,647
Do what you want to me,
but I can't help you.

885
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,441
My family would be in...

886
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,485
Your family's
already in trouble.

887

891
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,791
and their little kiddies.

892

dies today.

893

894
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,895

Aren't you that sweaty young man
from Believe?

975
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:04,828
Hi, Mrs. January.

976
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,830
Is that a human hand?

977
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,875
Yes, it is.
Come on. We got to go. (grunts)

978
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,877
(groaning softly)

979
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,051
Hughie?

980
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,639
DONNA (gasps):
Annie! Annie! Annie!

981
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,474
-Oh, my God! Oh!
-Annie!

982
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:28,476
Hmm.

983
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,562
-Oh!
-(both panting)

984
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,982
Hey.

985
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,901
Wh-What are you doing here?

986
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,913
How are we gonna
get out of here?

987
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,166
I know a way.

988
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,587
(oven beeps)

989
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,885
All right, dinner's ready!

990
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,928
(quietly):
Assholes. (grunts)

991
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,098
Hey, bud.
You ready for dinner?

992
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,728
What's wrong?

993
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,190
You're a liar.

994
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,358
-You lied to me.
-What do you mean?

995
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,569
They just flew me up and
showed me! This house is fake?

996
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,321
The neighbors are fake?
You're fake?

997
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,156
Boy deserves to know the truth.

998
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,950
Hey. Listen to me.

999
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,243
We can talk about this, okay?

1000
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,661
I know that you must
feel confused,

1001
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,413
and there are reasons
for what I did. I'm sorry.

1002
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,081
No, just don't touch me!
I hate you!

1003
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,919
I think he just needs
a little space.

1004
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,172
-Come here, son.
-No. No.

1005
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,925
All right, he needs his mother.

1006
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,968
Don't worry.
He'll still have a mother.

1007
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,014
Hey, Ryan. Ryan!

1008
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,724
Hey, Ryan, no!

1009
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,017
Ryan! No!

1010
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,941
(crying):
Oh, my God. No. Please.

1011
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,694
MOTHER'S MILK:
Kid, you are
fucking unbelievable.

1012
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,613
All you had to do
was watch porn.

1013
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,490
I didn't know he was gonna
set himself on fire.

1014
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,575
-Hey.
-What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

1015
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,161
Butcher? It's me.

1016
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:13,998
No, I'm afraid Hugh let our star
witness burn himself to death.

1017
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,459
-Thank you.
-MALLORY: Well, I don't know.

1018
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,712
What do you mean, no worries?

1019
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,257
I mean, I've got it sorted.

1020

1022

You're gonna stitch me up again?

1023
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,402
He's at the airport.

1024
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,070
I promise.

1025
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:46,990
You got a right bloody nerve,
you do.

1026
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,201
Ah, and I didn't mean
for it to go so bad.

1027
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,203
I'm sorry.

1028
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,539
You won't have to see him again.

1029
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,834
He ain't got much longer.
Couple of months.

1030
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,838
Tell me when it happens.

1031
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,631
I'll piss on his coffin.

1032
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:06,301
I didn't do it for him.

1033
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,595
(Connie sighs)

1034
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,846
He's a cunt.

1035
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,312
I just thought,

1036
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:21,274
when you saw
how helpless he is now...

1037
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,483
you'd let it go.

1038
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,030
He wouldn't have
this hold over you,

1039
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,824
and you wouldn't become like...

1040
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,539
Yeah, well...

1041
