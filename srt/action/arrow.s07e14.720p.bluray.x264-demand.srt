1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,269
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,576
There was a fire
in the apartment.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Your mom was
in there.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,896
It wasn't the fire
that killed her.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,639
<i>Your mission is
about revenge.</i>

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,496
- Dante's a person.
- He is the financier

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,352
behind dozens
of terrorist attacks.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,760
Deputy Director Bell.

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,016
We're in the process of
reinstating the ghost initiative.

10
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,794
Restoring the program is the
only way we can get Dante

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,280
without A.R.G.U.S.
oversight.

12
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,280
We were able to backtrace
the number Diaz called.

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,118
It belongs to Dante's
contact Virgil.

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,317
Blackstar's our only lead
on finding those bombs.

15
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,874
Felicity's still
alive.

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,994
You're not
gonna shoot me.

17
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,434
My name is Mia Smoak.

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,715
I'm Felicity's daughter

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,995
and your sister.

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,954
I'm coming, I'm coming!

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,158
Where are you?
I can't find you!

22
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,115
Oh, oh, aah!

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,271
I'll always find you...

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,760
Both of you.

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,240
You stay away from me.

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,357
You stay away
from me and my family!

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,515
You can't protect
your baby.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,831
William, it's your dad again,

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,936
and I don't know if you're
getting my messages, buddy,

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,395
because you're not
returning my calls.

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,193
I tried... I tried
calling the house.

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,936
Look. I know that I'm not
your grandparents' favorite,

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,599
but Felicity and I,
we just want to know

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,736
how you're settling in, and we
would love to hear your Voice

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,910
because we really miss y...

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,390
<i>The mailbox is now full.
Good-bye.</i>

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,997
He's still not
answering your calls.

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,520
No.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,274
Zoe froze me out
when I first lost custody.

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,158
Don't worry.
He'll come around.

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,640
You just got to
be patient.

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,712
Patience is not really
my thing, Rene,

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,838
but thank you.

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,876
Any word on when Dinah
is coming back?

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,350
Well, she's already
tried to check herself

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,477
out the hospital
a couple of times.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,712
Patience is also not
really her thing.

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,110
- Working a new case?
- Not exactly.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,078
It's for your
sister. Yeah.

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,038
That's still weird
to say out loud.

51
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
OK, Rene, look.

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,839
Our team has been deputized

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,832
to work with the SCPD.

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,355
She hasn't been.
She shouldn't be out there

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,831
as a vigilante,
and I would actually really appreciate

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,240
if you didn't
encourage her.

57
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,198
Do you really think
I could stop her?

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,794
Stubbornness runs
in the family.

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,111
Besides,
this is personal.

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,873
Why?

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,634
This is the bullet
that killed her mother.

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,792
Her mother
was murdered?

63
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,599
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

64
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,816
Look. I'm not trying to get in
the middle of any family drama.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,240
Too late.

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,633
Her mother was murdered
over a year ago.

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,632
- Ohh.
- Emiko's been trying to find

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,040
the killer
ever since,

69
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,635
but all she's found
were dead ends.

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,076
This bullet is her
only legit lead.

71
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,696
Does she have any reason
to blame my family

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,074
for her mother's death?

73
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,680
Y'all did become
Starling City Royalty

74
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,001
while she and her mom were left
to struggle in The Glades.

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,997
All I'm saying is
there's a difference

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,952
between trust
and trust fund.

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,072
- She trusts you?
- That's because I had to prove

78
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,640
to her
that she could.

79
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,072
OK. I'll prove it, too.

80
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,076
Just like
my father taught me.

81
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,595
He should have taught you
how to aim, boy.

82
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,080
You'd be lucky
to break skin.

83
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,799
Do you two
ever stop talking?

84
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,159
Oops.

85
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,076
That is enough.
You're supposed to be training,

86
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,320
not trying to
kill each other.

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,551
Aww. Why you
got to ruin all the fun?

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,639
The op in Cairo
was a bust.

89
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,876
Dante's emissary Virgil
managed to evade us.

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,316
Virgil was
our only contact to Dante.

91
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,056
All that effort to trick Diaz
into giving up the number,

92
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,200
and we're back
to square one.

93
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,276
Not completely.

94
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,192
We still have the records
from Virgil's phone.

95
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,509
That could lead
us to Dante.

96
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,274
Meantime, Dante is
wreaking havoc,

97
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,953
financing terrorists
all over the world.

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,336
I was hoping to be done
with this group by now.

99
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,591
I know. The only thing anyone
knows about this operation

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,717
is that Diaz is a part
of the ghost initiative,

101
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,118
but the longer this
takes, the more likely

102
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,056
A.R.G.U.S. brass is to
find out the real reason

103
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,471
for the ghost initiative
is to go after Dante.

104
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,358
It's time to tell
Oliver and Felicity.

105
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,752
Our position now is
riskier than ever.

106
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,038
The less secrets we have,
the better.

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,950
My sister?

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,314
No. That's not possible.

109
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
I wish it wasn't,
but here I am.

110
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,274
Now, get the damn gun
off me.

111
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,317
He will when
you stop lying.

112
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,616
It just doesn't
make any sense.

113
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,075
We all knew Oliver
and Felicity.

114
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,719
They never had
a daughter.

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,871
Guess you didn't know
them as well as you think.

116
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,278
Is this true?
Is she their kid?

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,589
Hey. Whoa. Let him go.

118
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,736
He doesn't know who
my parents are.

119
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,592
I never told him.

120
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,600
She's telling
the truth.

121
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,433
Look, Mia,

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,875
Mia, my dad told me
to keep a watch on you

123
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,838
and keep you safe,

124
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,515
so I know who
your father is.

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,637
Your dad
knew, too?

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,949
Who the hell
is your dad?

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,074
John Diggle is
my adoptive father.

128
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,117
- A vigilante.
- Mia...

129
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,920
so you've been lying to
me this entire time?

130
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,996
Well, now that we're
all acquainted,

131
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,119
what the hell are you
doing down here?

132
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,350
She's looking
for Felicity,

133
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,397
who's apparently not dead.

134
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,675
How do you know?

135
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,240
Because she's done
this before.

136
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,631
She's just hiding somewhere,
being paranoid like always.

137
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,392
Figured it
might be here this time.

138
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,936
So you're just
going on a hunch, huh?

139
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,111
No. I am going
on an entire lifetime

140
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,395
of dealing with her.

141
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,278
Did you even bother
checking into her murder?

142
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,953
Of course we did.

143
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
She died
in an explosion.

144
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,636
Did you actually see a body?

145
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,033
OK.
So where do we start?

146
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,993
Yeah. I'm not looking for any
kind of family reunion here, bro.

147
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,039
Oh, I'm sorry, sis,
but I have come too far

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,272
to get sidelined now,
so we're helping each other

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,272
whether you want to
or not.

150
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,878
The ghost initiative sounds
a lot like task force x.

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,316
Didn't Lyla shelve
that years ago?

152
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
She did,
but there's now

153
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,120
a more immediate,
more dangerous target

154
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,113
that the brass at A.R.G.U.S.,
even above Lyla,

155
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,157
is preventing us
from pursuing.

156
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,456
We're using
the ghost initiative

157
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,312
to go after
this target

158
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,754
without their
oversight.

159
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,433
Well, I love
a spontaneous ota moment

160
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,749
as much
as the next person,

161
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,594
but you didn't really
come here to tell us

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,479
about resurrecting an old A.R.G.U.S.
defunct program, did you?

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,313
It's not
about the program.

164
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,079
It's about
who's in it.

165
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,836
- Ricardo Diaz.
- Ohh.

166
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,274
You have to be joking.

167
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,477
You're working with the man
who threatened

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,791
and tried to kill
my entire family?

169
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,096
I think it's important that
we hear what John has to say.

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,591
Working with this monster
is a small price to pay

171
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,639
for bringing down
a much larger threat.

172
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,474
Diaz was the only one we could
use to get close to this guy,

173
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
and I promise you he is
a million times worse.

174
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,736
So Diaz is just walking around free
right now in exchange for intel?

175
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,912
He's not free, Felicity.
He has a bomb in his head.

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
If he makes one misstep...

177
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,714
We are taking
every precaution.

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,598
Well, I understand
why Curtis left.

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,830
Hey.

180
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,593
You can't really be
OK with this.

181
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,560
No, but i... I trust John,

182
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,360
and I believe

183
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,796
that he would only take
a step like this

184
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,758
if he had
no other choice.

185
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,559
There was
no other choice,

186
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,313
and I hate that
it came to this,

187
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,993
but Lyla and I
believe that using

188
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,595
the ghost initiative is the best
way to take down this threat.

189
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,956
You realize that this is
the second time you have

190
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,509
prioritized your job over
keeping your friends safe?

191
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,592
Working with A.R.G.U.S.
does keep you safe

192
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,110
because it makes
the world safe.

193
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,919
You can keep telling
yourself that.

194
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,913
Meet Virgil,
an intermediary

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,310
for the terrorist
financier known as Dante.

196
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,710
- Diaz should be familiar.
- Nice guy.

197
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,315
Your job is to meet
with Virgil,

198
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,551
convince him that he should
be in business with you.

199
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,553
You get through Virgil,
you get a meeting with Dante.

200
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,199
So our first mission
is a meeting?

201
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,634
That is way
below our pay grade.

202
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,951
Wait. We're getting paid?

203
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,673
If we can even
get the meeting.

204
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,150
I tried once.
Virgil wouldn't take my call.

205
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,435
He wouldn't
take yours,

206
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,596
but he'll take his.

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,990
Diaz is the reason we've
been able to track Virgil.

208
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,276
So what do you say, Diaz?

209
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,397
You want to make that call
for real this time?

210
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,793
I thought you'd
never ask.

211
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,637
OK. Operation blow the
head off the dragon

212
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,790
is officially
a go.

213
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,416
I overrode A.R.G.U.S.'s
security protocols

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,999
and accessed the bomb
in Diaz's brain,

215
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,195
which means as soon as dig's ghost
initiative mission is over, one click.

216
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,509
Boom!

217
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,954
That's great.

218
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,632
- High score on candy crush?
- I'm working.

219
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,696
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that being a fake lawyer

220
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,473
was more interesting
that getting revenge

221
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,791
on the bastard
who killed Quentin.

222
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,315
Fine. I'm listening.
Happy?

223
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,313
All you have to do is get
within 100 feet of Diaz,

224
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,039
which should be easy
for the D.A.,

225
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,589
and then just click
this button right here

226
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,856
and activate
the remote detonator.

227
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,075
♪♪ Da da da ♪♪

228
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,833
Won't that send me
straight to the top

229
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,957
of most likely to have
killed Diaz list?

230
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,914
Heh. What do you care?

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
You've been trying
to kill Diaz for months.

232
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,816
I mean, the only
reason he's still alive

233
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,753
is because we needed him
to get Oliver out of prison.

234
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,231
True...
But some things have changed.

235
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,040
I mean, I'm kind of
good at this D.A. thing,

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
so I'm not really sure I'm
ready to give it up yet.

237
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,436
Well, I'm not ready to
give up on getting Diaz.

238
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,115
Diaz is in A.R.G.U.S.
custody.

239
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
He's not running
around free.

240
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,991
Trust me.
I would be thrilled to see his head explode,

241
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,456
but is it really worth
the consequences?

242
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,914
Yes, it is worth
every consequence.

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,515
I have to protect
my family.

244
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,519
By family you mean
you, Oliver,

245
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,638
and your baby?

246
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,518
What, are you
psychic now?

247
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,353
Well, there's no wine
or champagne

248
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,794
and no caffeine
on this mission,

249
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,076
and that... that is
a pregnant lady

250
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,496
amount of chocolates
you just consumed.

251
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,876
I ate that much chocolate
before I was pregnant.

252
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,038
- No one else knows.
- Not even Oliver?

253
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,216
I haven't found the
right time to tell him.

254
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,256
I've been trying to tell him,
so I would really, really appreciate it

255
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,317
if you wouldn't tell...

256
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,914
Anyone.

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,151
I won't.

258
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
I promise.

259
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,671
Really snap
your wrist next time.

260
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,316
Gives it a bit
more power.

261
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,598
How the hell did you
get in here?

262
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,070
I have something
for you.

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,736
- Of course Rene told you.
- Don't get mad at Rene.

264
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,672
I just...
I want to help.

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,116
I had Felicity analyze the
composition of the bullet.

266
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,999
- It's made from a...
- a rare promethium alloy,

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,716
the kind used by a handful of black
market weapons manufacturers?

268
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,553
I've done my homework.

269
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,520
Do you know it was shot
with a customized rifle?

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,719
Specs are
on the drive.

271
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,680
Thanks.

272
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,240
I can help you catch
who made it.

273
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,152
This is my mission.

274
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,916
OK. Maybe we can discuss
your mother.

275
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,675
Rene has
a big mouth.

276
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,831
I'm glad he told me, OK?

277
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,437
I know what it's like
to lose a parent.

278
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,591
I don't want
your sympathy.

279
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,516
I want justice.

280
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,319
Except you're not
authorized to get it.

281
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,160
I am.

282
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,033
Why should I
trust you?

283
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,750
I understand that my parents
weren't exactly the best people,

284
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,231
but... if they taught
me one thing,

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,437
it's the value
of family,

286
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,876
which is what
you and I are,

287
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,073
so if someone's hurt you,

288
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,512
you better believe
they've hurt me, too.

289
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,279
I don't know how we're gonna used
this old stuff to find Felicity.

290
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,272
It's like
a tech time capsule.

291
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,397
Here goes nothing.

292
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,755
Whoa.

293
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,479
And we have liftoff.

294
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,478
I thought you
had Archer.

295
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,896
Why do you need all
this old junk?

296
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
Because as advanced
as Archer is,

297
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,720
it was designed
for The Glades.

298
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,519
This system was
built for Star City.

299
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,736
So who am I looking
for again?

300
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,594
Uh, some guy.
Paul loiseau.

301
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,593
Scpd has him listed
as the only eyewitness

302
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,080
to Felicity's murder.

303
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,715
I'm guessing she paid him
to say she was there.

304
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,996
Says this guy committed
suicide about a week ago.

305
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,080
Wait. That was right when we started
looking into Felicity's disappearance.

306
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,679
What about the coroner?

307
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,676
Another suicide.

308
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,275
Star City's bad
but not that bad.

309
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,976
Someone's taking these people out,
but why?

310
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,957
So Felicity uncovers
a bomb plot,

311
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,236
but before she can tell anybody,
the party responsible

312
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,470
fakes her death.

313
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,279
Now they're tying up
loose ends.

314
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,800
- So why not just kill her?
- Because they needed her.

315
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,233
You were the last one to talk to Felicity.
What did she say?

316
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,199
Just the usual bull about
how the city's not safe

317
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,873
and she wanted me
to get out of town.

318
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,350
It might not have
been bull this time.

319
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,034
You guys are just junkies
looking for your hero fix.

320
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,077
My mom is the only
person I care about,

321
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,431
and I'm gonna go look for her
myself without any of you.

322
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,751
- Hold on. Mia...
- get the hell off!

323
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,513
That goes
for all of you.

324
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,833
This is my kind
of place.

325
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,718
This used to be
a triad hangout.

326
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,995
Everyone, focus.

327
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,117
The objective is to find Virgil

328
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,714
and get him to agree
to your deal.

329
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Where is Virgil?

330
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,033
Ah, speak of the devil,

331
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,759
and he shall appear.

332
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,638
Ricardo Diaz,

333
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,030
and here I thought the
almighty dragon was in prison.

334
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,873
No prison could hold me.

335
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,110
You should know that.

336
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,873
No bodyguards.
That's a good sign.

337
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,316
Now all you have to do
is convince him.

338
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,039
You know, Mr. Diaz,
I was, uh...

339
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,913
I was happy
to get your call.

340
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,393
My employer would like to know
when he can collect on your debt.

341
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,909
The Longbow Hunters
were not cheap.

342
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,159
We have
a proposition,

343
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,674
and I think it will cover
more than what I owe.

344
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
That's intriguing.

345
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,958
Too bad it wasn't made
in good faith, though.

346
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Kill them,

347
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,032
except for Mr. Diaz.

348
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,079
<i>Dante will deal with him
personally tonight.</i>

349
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,599
Don't let Virgil leave!

350
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,190
Unh!

351
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,717
Great. Now we owe
her one.

352
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,995
Move!

353
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,233
Nowhere to run, Virgil!

354
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,634
Treachery earns the worst punishment,
Ricardo.

355
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,189
Dante will make sure you
get what you deserve.

356
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,555
Ha ha ha!

357
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,112
Are the handcuffs
really necessary?

358
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,376
Until you tell us which
one of you tipped off Virgil.

359
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
Hey.
We were caught in the same ambush.

360
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,237
In case you missed
the show out there,

361
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,674
we almost died.

362
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,479
Well,
some of us did.

363
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,438
You got something
you want to say to me?

364
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,072
Maybe
"Dante will deal with him personally"

365
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,470
was actually code
for "get Diaz out

366
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,914
before
the bloodbath."

367
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,832
- The phone call to Virgil.
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,798
Diaz must have warned
him somehow.

369
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,315
I'll have the analysts
look into encoded phrases.

370
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,631
Lady, you ain't
gonna find anything

371
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,320
because I wasn't the one
who warned them.

372
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Sure you didn't.

373
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,432
You didn't really
think this one through.

374
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,480
Even if you and Virgil had
ridden off into the sunset,

375
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,473
mommy and daddy wouldn't
have let you get very far.

376
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,040
He didn't think we
would really do it.

377
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,157
You guys, you have no idea
who you're messing with.

378
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,197
You're afraid.

379
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,000
You'd rather have a bomb
explode in your head

380
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,720
than risk Dante finding
out that you betrayed him.

381
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,953
Once Dante figures
all of this out...

382
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,199
and he will...

383
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,353
you all are gonna be wishing
for the mercy of a quick death.

384
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,595
<i>Laurel Lance
entering Queen residence.</i>

385
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,194
No more sad chocolates.

386
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,671
I got you
a roasted turkey sandwich.

387
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,314
It's not deli meat.
I double-checked.

388
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,632
Also, I got you some
fruit and veggies.

389
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,359
Are you on any
prenatal vitamins?

390
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,352
Any Mac and cheese
in there? No?

391
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,078
Clearly, you're having some
kind of weird pregnancy crisis,

392
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,392
and killing Ricardo Diaz
is not going to solve it.

393
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,976
Focusing on killing the maniac who
wants to kill me and my family

394
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,074
might be a little bit more helpful than...
Eating that banana.

395
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,357
One, you need
the potassium.

396
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,874
Two, yes,
you're right.

397
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,510
Your husband's job is to
be the enemy of monsters,

398
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,115
and those monsters are going
to target you and your family

399
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,520
like they always have.

400
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,877
Thank you. That is
incredibly reassuring.

401
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,189
You are more
than capable

402
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,919
of protecting yourself
and your family.

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,392
I mean, you built this insane,
crazy security system.

404
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,473
Which didn't work the last
time somebody targeted us.

405
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,991
- So? You'll fix it.
- Yeah. OK.

406
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,916
In half a day, you hacked
into Ricardo Diaz's brain.

407
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,229
I don't know
if you've noticed,

408
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,829
but you're kind of
a badass.

409
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,995
What if it's
not enough?

410
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,160
Look.

411
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,713
There will always
be another Diaz.

412
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,076
- Oh.
- You just have to have faith

413
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,277
that you can handle
the next one

414
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,277
and the one after that
and the one after that.

415
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,995
You know,
this baby's really lucky to have you.

416
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,911
I know it's scary,

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,673
but I promise
you've got this,

418
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,116
and if you want to
kill Ricardo Diaz,

419
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,510
I am not gonna
stand in your way,

420
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,353
but don't do it
out of fear

421
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,232
because you have nothing
to be afraid of.

422
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,711
We just finished the
analysis of the phone call

423
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,120
between Diaz
and Virgil.

424
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,396
No obvious ciphers
or patterns.

425
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,896
OK. Well, if Diaz
was telling the truth,

426
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,616
then Virgil must have been
tipped off by someone else.

427
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,439
Probably the same someone who's
been blocking us at A.R.G.U.S.,

428
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,216
and now they know we're
using the ghost initiative

429
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,879
to go after Dante.

430
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,758
We need to catch him before
they shut us down completely.

431
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,671
Any luck figuring out
his next move?

432
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,479
Well, we did manage
to find this.

433
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,473
It's an Italian florin
coin circa 1300s.

434
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,512
Wouldn't have pegged
Virgil as a coin collector.

435
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,478
He wasn't.
It's a fake.

436
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,837
Turns out there's a
microchip hidden inside.

437
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,673
Well, that sounds
promising.

438
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,594
Unfortunately, the data's
very heavily encrypted.

439
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,115
I don't really trust giving
it to an A.R.G.U.S. analyst,

440
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,630
but Curtis did leave us
his decryption algorithm.

441
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,552
Considerate of him.

442
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
It's gonna take
a while.

443
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,393
Well, hopefully,
not too long.

444
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,756
If Dante's in town, it must
be for something big.

445
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,072
Um,
the algorithm you wrote to find the weapon

446
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,355
is lagging
a little bit.

447
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,955
Do you... Mind
if I take a look?

448
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,191
The algorithm's fine.

449
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,030
OK.

450
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,235
Do you have to
stand right there?

451
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,031
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

452
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,713
I had to help Zoe
with her test.

453
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,757
Geometry's a bitch.

454
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,991
- How we looking?
- Fantastic.

455
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,390
The weight on these
feels a little strange.

456
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,358
Did you make these
yourself or...

457
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,840
- no.
- I'm just asking because

458
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,957
when I started out,
I made most of my own Arrows,

459
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,879
and I could show you a
trick or two if you want.

460
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,960
What I want is for you
to not touch my things.

461
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,391
And that's a hit! OK.

462
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,473
Andrew Thornton.
Specializes

463
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,552
in promethium-based
customized weaponry.

464
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,269
That sounds like our guy.

465
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,874
Yeah. Now we just
have to find him.

466
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,952
According to that online
chatter right there,

467
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,076
he's doing a deal
tonight

468
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,231
at an industrial plant
in Pennytown.

469
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,879
- Hmm.
- So what's the plan?

470
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,896
Rene's gonna roll with me,
and you need to stay here.

471
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,877
No way. I'm not
staying behind.

472
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,952
You don't have
a badge, OK?

473
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,272
I'm sorry,
but I promise you

474
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,079
we will take care
of this.

475
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,233
Let's go, Rene.

476
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,354
Gentlemen, who's ready
to do some business?

477
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,640
Behold my masterpiece.

478
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,155
Fully customizable
to your specifications.

479
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,595
- Unh!
- Ugh!

480
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,760
I'll handle Thornton!

481
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Copy that.

482
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,758
Ugh!

483
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,354
Thornton's mine.

484
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,353
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

485
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,272
Taking back my mission!

486
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,200
There's two of you now?!

487
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,536
You're gonna tell me
everything you know

488
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,880
about the murder
of Kazumi Adachi!

489
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,873
Andrew Thornton,
up against the wall!

490
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,320
By the authority of the SCPD,
I am placing you under arrest.

491
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,153
You have the right
to remain silent.

492
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,560
What the hell
are you doing?

493
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,639
I'm taking him in
for questioning.

494
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,951
No. This is my mission.
I need to question him my way!

495
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,520
You'd be breaking the law,

496
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,829
which you're
already doing!

497
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,277
There's a right way
and a wrong way to do this.

498
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,416
The only thing
I've done wrong

499
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,875
is think that I could
ever trust you.

500
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,916
Hey. Thornton's ready
to be questioned.

501
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,919
Thought you'd be
happier about that.

502
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,469
Yeah. Sorry. I just...
with Emiko.

503
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,758
I need to make her understand
we're on the same side.

504
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,790
I think the problem
is you thinking

505
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,837
you can make
her do anything.

506
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,276
Yeah. I've been doing
this a long time.

507
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,158
She's new,
she's unsanctioned,

508
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,232
and I'm trying to
help her.

509
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,073
But she didn't ask
for your help.

510
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,514
Imagine how you
would feel

511
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,717
if, when you first
started your quest,

512
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,456
someone had basically
ripped your father's list

513
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,278
out of your hand and
taken over your mission.

514
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,989
I see your point.

515
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,719
Emiko doesn't need
anybody telling her

516
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,359
what to do
or how to do it,

517
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,080
and she definitely doesn't
need anyone's protection.

518
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,753
You see that move
she did with the bow

519
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,035
and switched hands?

520
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,600
Yeah. It's impressive.

521
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,194
Ridiculous.

522
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,520
Just be her brother

523
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,876
if you want her to be in
your life and to trust you.

524
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,076
Just...

525
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,958
Just be her brother.

526
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,155
Hey!

527
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,914
It's just me...
your brother, apparently.

528
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,376
What,
you think just because we're related

529
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,960
I'm not gonna kick
your ass out of here?

530
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,719
That was the hope, yeah.

531
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
If you're here to
convince me to join

532
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,336
your little merry
band of heroes,

533
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
save your breath.

534
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,278
Actually, I was just
hoping that we could

535
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,829
commiserate about how much
our parents suck.

536
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,673
I never had anyone to do
that with before.

537
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,399
What do you have
against our parents?

538
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,200
Seems like you
came out all right.

539
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,078
You're super rich.

540
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,270
Well, let's see.

541
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,272
Oliver, being my dad,
got my mom killed.

542
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,829
Then he and Felicity
promised to stay in my life

543
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,479
after my grandparents
took custody,

544
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,552
and then I never heard
from them again,

545
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,711
and my whole justification
for it, you know,

546
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,589
that it's hard for publicly recognized
vigilantes to raise children,

547
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,433
sort of went out the window
when I found out

548
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,831
they actually had
another kid,

549
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,470
which means that they
just didn't want me.

550
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,954
Being the kid they wanted
wasn't so great either.

551
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,877
If you hate Felicity
so much,

552
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,560
why are you wasting all this time
trying to find out where she is?

553
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,592
- Because of this.
- A rock?

554
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,717
Felicity gave it to me
when I was a kid,

555
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,917
and it's how she sent out
her distress signal...

556
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,799
now nearly
two decades later.

557
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,633
And you held onto it
all this time.

558
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,598
It's actually
really sad.

559
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,560
Thanks.

560
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,393
You know, parents
aren't perfect.

561
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,719
They love us
the best way they can.

562
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,595
Ahh. Maybe I was just
trying to do the same.

563
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,792
My whole life,
my mom told me that our dad was a hero,

564
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,840
but everything in this
city says the opposite,

565
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,994
that all of our problems
today are because of him

566
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,958
and the other
vigilantes.

567
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,792
You knew him
back then.

568
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,077
Was he a hero?

569
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,479
Yeah, he really was,

570
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,960
and, you know,
I'm starting to think

571
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,637
that this rock was
supposed to lead me to you.

572
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,872
Family was always the most
important thing to my...

573
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,516
our parents.

574
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,715
Damn it, you are here to just
talk me into joining you.

575
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,714
Well, did it work?

576
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,638
We have a lead
on Dante's location.

577
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,233
- What's wrong?
- I got a call from the Pentagon.

578
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,313
They want me in front of
the joint chiefs tomorrow.

579
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,790
They're going to ask
for my resignation.

580
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,236
Lyla, I'm so sorry.
I should have never

581
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,976
forced your hand
with the ghost initiative.

582
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,536
I backed that play
with open eyes, Johnny,

583
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,392
and I stand by it now.

584
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,995
Still, I never thought it would
mean you losing your job.

585
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,037
Then we better
make it count.

586
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,077
Dante is within our grasp,
and we may not have another chance.

587
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,553
Now tell me
about that lead.

588
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,671
Well, Curtis' algorithm
absolutely worked.

589
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,752
According to the
microchip in the coin,

590
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,036
Virgil was using it as some
sort of storage device

591
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,157
for all kinds
of data,

592
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,391
including a forged
diplomatic credential

593
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,994
from the quraci embassy.

594
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,560
There's a delegation
there tonight

595
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,711
with a very interesting
guest of honor...

596
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,314
Princess noor harjavti.

597
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,629
Rumor has it

598
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,110
Princess noor is planning
a revolution.

599
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,477
So she needs Dante's money
to fund her palace coup,

600
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,472
which may be the reason
why he's in town...

601
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,710
to make
the deal.

602
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,234
We need to get
into the embassy

603
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,630
and stop that deal from
happening and nab Dante.

604
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,074
Copy that.
Only one problem.

605
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,296
We have no idea
how Dante looks.

606
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,119
- We know somebody who does.
- Diaz.

607
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,856
Which means we have to put
him back in the field.

608
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,270
That's not our
biggest problem.

609
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,033
The ghost initiative
is blown,

610
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,536
and we can't rely
on anyone at A.R.G.U.S.,

611
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,200
and we cannot go in
there without backup.

612
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,033
Maybe we don't have to.

613
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
Just got
off the phone with John.

614
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,435
He and Lyla are
gearing up

615
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,034
for a ghost initiative op.

616
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,440
They asked me to be
in the field.

617
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,193
In the field
with whom exactly?

618
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,389
Diaz?

619
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,760
I told John it was
your decision.

620
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,674
Whatever you decide
after the mission,

621
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,832
I will back any move that you
want to make against Diaz.

622
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,877
Oh, you don't
mean that.

623
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,429
You know what?

624
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,680
I know why you've been acting
so strange lately, right?

625
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,029
- You do?
- Yeah.

626
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,713
I was gonna tell you.

627
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,096
There's just been
so much going on. I...

628
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,634
you're planning
to kill Diaz.

629
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,589
Yeah. Uh, so I'm guessing
there is a speech coming.

630
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,558
Felicity, I think
there's a better way.

631
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,872
I... I think that,
but that's my choice.

632
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,880
I have no right
whatsoever to make yours.

633
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,197
Right after I got
out of slabside, i...

634
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,718
I didn't realize
or totally understand the...

635
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,514
the pain that
you were dealing with.

636
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,274
I just want you
to get closure

637
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,194
because I want us to be
able to move forward.

638
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,278
I hope you change
your mind,

639
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,400
but if you don't,

640
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,311
I swear I will not
stand in your way.

641
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,993
- Thank you.
- I have your back

642
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,072
no matter what.

643
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,120
Tell John you're
coming on the mission.

644
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,635
And so am I.

645
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,195
Harbinger's in position.
Sitrep?

646
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,749
I count 11, 12 guards
in this room alone.

647
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,991
We have to move
on Dante after the meet.

648
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,992
Agreed. You copy
that, Diaz?

649
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,992
Sure thing, boss.

650
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,799
Can't wait for you
to meet Dante.

651
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,951
Joke all you want.
Just remember,

652
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,078
we're only keeping you alive
so you can I.D. Dante.

653
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,431
After that,
all bets are off.

654
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,557
<i>Overwatch,
what's your status?</i>

655
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,336
The feed is live, but 5 of the cameras
are down in the souTheast corridor.

656
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,476
One guess as to why.

657
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,438
That's where we'll find
Dante and the Princess.

658
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,960
They don't want eyes
on the exchange.

659
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,031
Hold on.
What the hell is Director Bell doing here?

660
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,759
Son of a bitch.
He's Dante's source.

661
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,309
Looks like somebody
owes me an apology.

662
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,349
The Princess is here.

663
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,479
Everyone head
to the south corridor.

664
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,994
Your highness.

665
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,270
Princess noor,
at last we meet.

666
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,840
That must be him.

667
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,674
Diaz, can you
confirm? Diaz?

668
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,319
His signal is offline.

669
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,496
His last location was the
auxiliary room to your right.

670
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,751
I've got it.
Stay in position.

671
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,517
Forgive me.
Virgil couldn't make it.

672
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,796
I wasn't expecting
other company.

673
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,237
Not company.
More like proof of concept.

674
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,710
Mr. Bell works
for A.R.G.U.S.,

675
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,998
one of the many we've
installed at the agency

676
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,958
that now work for you.

677
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,314
My god.

678
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,110
Diaz must have used a defibrillator
to short the chip out.

679
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,554
That's why we lost
his signal!

680
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,673
Dante.

681
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,354
Excuse me.

682
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Mr. Diaz.

683
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,553
No.

684
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,869
You owe me a debt.

685
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,032
This is the payment.

686
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,520
It's a setup.

687
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,910
Please.

688
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
Unh!

689
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,639
Forgive me, Princess.

690
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,955
- You OK?
- Yeah.

691
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,271
Dante's headed for the south exit.
Everybody move in.

692
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
What about Diaz?

693
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,999
Dante's the objective. Go!

694
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,119
Leaving so soon?

695
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,955
Nah.

696
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,270
Don't miss.

697
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,718
Hey!

698
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,029
You don't get to
go free.

699
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,433
Honey, didn't we go
through this already?

700
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,989
You don't have
what it takes.

701
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,276
I do,

702
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,717
and I'm not
scared of you,

703
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,678
and I am stronger
than you are,

704
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,677
which is why

705
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,240
I'm not
going to kill you.

706
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,736
I thought Dante
was the objective.

707
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,117
He is the objective,
just not the priority.

708
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,833
Not this time.

709
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
You made a big mistake.

710
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,034
Stand down!

711
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
This is over.

712
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,034
For now.

713
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,956
He's gone.

714
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,191
Well, Diaz will be
taken back to slabside

715
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,232
for reneging on his
side of the deal.

716
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,792
This time,
he'll stay there.

717
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,270
Still need to think
about Dante.

718
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,776
He's not gonna forget
what happened tonight.

719
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,870
I won't either.

720
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,936
You could have gone after
Dante, but you chose Diaz.

721
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
Last year,
I had the opportunity to catch Diaz,

722
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,056
and I let it slip
through my fingers.

723
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,496
I wasn't gonna make
the same mistake twice.

724
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,637
Well, what about Dante
being the greater threat?

725
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,456
When I knew there was a
choice between catching

726
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,120
Diaz or Dante,
all I could think about was

727
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,676
what letting Diaz go meant to you last time,
Felicity,

728
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,832
so in that moment,
I decided that

729
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,992
sometimes the best choice is
to just protect your family,

730
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,560
and that's exactly
what you two are.

731
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,120
I just got off the phone
with the Pentagon.

732
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,477
We'll give you
some privacy.

733
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,873
OK.

734
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,712
Agent bell will be getting
a hero's funeral.

735
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,553
The official story is
he was at the embassy

736
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,154
on a covert assignment
that went awry.

737
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,038
Right. So it's
a cover-up.

738
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,976
OK. What about
the ghost initiative?

739
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,656
- It's being suspended.
- Well, that's some good news.

740
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,000
That's all the good news.

741
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,800
We lost Dante,
and I lost my last chance to get him.

742
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,792
You didn't lose
your last chance.

743
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,230
I'll be the one
to resign.

744
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,199
Look. We will tell
them that I took out

745
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,158
the ghost initiative
without your consent

746
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,280
and without your
knowledge.

747
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,596
No. This is
my responsibility.

748
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,433
Lyla, listen
to me.

749
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,116
We have no idea how far
this conspiracy goes.

750
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,320
If you step down
as director,

751
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,437
we may never
find out the truth.

752
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,437
Being terminated
for an opsec violation

753
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,637
will ruin your career.

754
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,313
But you'll still
have yours.

755
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,834
Let me take
this fall

756
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,239
for the family.

757
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Hey.

758
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,159
Glad you called.

759
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,200
Thought you were
done with me.

760
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,953
Yeah, I did, too...

761
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,720
Until I got that.

762
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,280
Yeah.

763
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,397
Thanks for having Rene
bring that over.

764
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,631
I'm sure it's not
SCPD protocol

765
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,598
to release
interrogation records.

766
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,637
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah.

767
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,632
Least I could do,
though.

768
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,230
It is your mission.

769
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,833
It's... been
hard for me

770
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,239
not seeing you as him.

771
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,436
Him being our father?

772
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,398
I just assumed
I shouldn't trust you.

773
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,796
That's why I've been keeping
so much distance between us.

774
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,990
Then you give me
a chance,

775
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,197
and I, of course,
immediately overstep.

776
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,998
Pretty much.

777
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,078
I've lost a lot
in my life.

778
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,595
People,
you know, but...

779
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,797
With you,
I lost time,

780
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,712
so you gave me a chance,
and I immediately saw it

781
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,871
as an opportunity to
get some of it back,

782
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,976
but there was
no excuse for the way

783
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,311
that I behaved when I was
coming aboard your mission.

784
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm sorry.

785
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,551
I didn't realize
Oliver Queen did apologies.

786
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,635
Well, I mean,
I didn't, but I've...

787
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,718
Grown a bit
over the years.

788
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,796
So? Fill me in.

789
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,314
What do you guys
have so far?

790
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,675
The same bomb plans
you have,

791
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,912
plus a map of tunnels
into The Glades.

792
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,476
Cube in a cube.

793
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,720
- You know it?
- Felicity used to

794
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,473
force this stuff
on me.

795
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,912
Little, uh,
mother-daughter bonding time

796
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,354
before I wised up.

797
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,591
There's another solve.

798
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,878
Cube in a... Cube...

799
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,997
In a cube.

800
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,274
No way. Huh.

801
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,953
What is that?

802
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,680
I think it's
a mini-cassette.

803
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,275
My grandparents had an answering
machine that used these.

804
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,355
What's
an answering machine?

805
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,069
It's not important.

806
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,355
What is important is the
message that's on this tape.

807
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,755
Can you hack it or...

808
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,560
no. You can't
hack this. Heh.

809
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,280
It's encryption
through obsolescence.

810
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,510
It's pretty genius,
actually.

811
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,956
Yeah, so genius,
you can't listen to it.

812
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,872
- We'll figure it out.
- I hope so...

813
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,794
Because this could be the
key to finding our mom.

814
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,360
<i>Green Arrow
entering Queen residence.</i>

815
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,591
Hey! How'd it go?

816
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,433
- Pretty good.
- Good.

817
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,876
I feel like we're
getting to a good place.

818
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,111
- Mint chip.
- Hmm. You want some?

819
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,600
I'm good.

820
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,536
Just needed a little
comfort food

821
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,596
after the night
we had.

822
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,036
A night that could have
ended very differently.

823
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,759
You want to know why
I didn't kill Diaz.

824
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,519
I wanted to.

825
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,957
I was ready to.

826
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,876
Then I realized
killing Diaz

827
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,031
wasn't going to
prove anything.

828
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,436
The whole reason
I wanted Diaz dead

829
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,477
was to protect
our family,

830
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,998
and... what our family needs

831
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,400
is a fresh start,

832
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,119
one in the light
just like you're doing.

833
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,397
I want our children
to know

834
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,191
that they are the most
important thing to us

835
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,552
and that we would
do anything...

836
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,955
Anything for them.

837
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,078
Ahem. You said,
"children."

838
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,795
I'm pregnant.

839
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,040
Ha ha!

840
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,753
Impressive.

841
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,635
You shouldn't be here.

842
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,317
Is that any way
to greet an old friend?

843
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,031
I hear you and Oliver Queen
are getting along quite well.

844
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,956
- He trusts me now.
- Good.

845
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,672
The timing couldn't
be better.

846
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,396
It's time for you
to come home.

847
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
What are you
doing here?

848
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,876
Unh!

849
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,554
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
