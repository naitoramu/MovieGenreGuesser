1
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,801
We'll make a control call every six hours.

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,761
Third unanswered call, that's 18 hours

3
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:13,081
without news of the Profesor.
- He'll be tying up some loose ends.

4
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:16,281
- We're in a critical situation.
- No, in a critical situation

5
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,961
we'll be if the Profesor doesn't
call in six hours.

6
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:21,241
And then we would activate the Chernobyl Plan.

7
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,241
I need you to look for all the farms

8
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,041
with hunting grounds within a radius of 100 km

9
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,361
from Palomeque's pharmacy.
If they bought the medicines there,

10
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,561
They were very close.

11
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:32,481
- Inspector, we have the estate.
- We have to check this house,

12
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,681
every corner.

13
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,681
The whole damn plan,
schedules, photos, plans...

14
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:45,401
This doesn't make any sense.
Call Alberto.

15
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:47,761
- Your ex-husband?
- Isn't he the best of the CSI?

16
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:49,321
Well, let him come.
- Hello, Raquel.

17
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:53,321
- This is Salva, my current partner.
Salvador Martin. Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,761
Nice to meet you too.

19
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,761
None of this is worth a shit.
Ángel went further than you

20
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,921
with the fingerprints he found.
- What fingerprints?

21
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,681
- Got a spoon, found someone in the band.

22
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:04,081
Or at least, it was very close.

23
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,681
The Profesor has been arrested.

24
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,921
But if he's being questioned at the
door of Toledo's house.

25
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,121
They've got the Profesor.
There's not going to be any tunnel

26
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,801
in the hangar, because the GEOS are
gonna be waiting for us.

27
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,681
Who still believes in the Profesor?

28
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,041
- I believe in the Profesor.
- I believe in what I see.

29
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,241
- I still trust the Profesor.
- I vote to get out of here now.

30
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:24,801
- I have a very good reason to be with the profesor,

31
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,001
I'm with Berlín.

32
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,321
Are you sure you want to do that?

33
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,921
That was your father, that's what matters.

34
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,081
And we're gonna do it for him.

35
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,401
- If there's anything useful here,
I know where it might be.

36
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,681
- Whatever they really wanted to erase,
they'll have burned there,

37
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,041
is the safest way to destroy something.

38
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,361
And that's what we'd all do.

39
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,561
Raquel, sorry...
I'm going to take this to Canillas.

40
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,801
Ah, look, I was just going to Madrid,
I was going to catch the bus.

41
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,561
I'm a little scrambled.
Do you want me to stop?

42
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,601
If you don't mind, I'd really appreciate it.

43
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,161
I was thinking about what you said before,

44
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,681
that you want the best for Raquel.
If it were true,

45
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:09,321
you wouldn't be fucking his sister.

46
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:11,401
Rubbish.
Get out of the car.

47
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,881
You're under arrest for assault on authority.

48
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,481
Listen to me, I need to ask you a favor.

49
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:33,081
When the action starts, you have to turn yourself in.

50
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,481
When things get complicated, I'll be with you

51
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,961
to an open grave.

52
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:45,681
Give me the gun.

53
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,321
Tell us what the Chernobyl Plan is.

54
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:53,481
I'm the only one here who knows the plan,

55
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:57,281
you're not gonna have a fucking clue
how to get out of this mousetrap.

56
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,241
What are you gonna do to me?

57
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,681
Son of a bitch, I hate you.

58
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,961
Why should this be the end of something?

59
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:53,481
Couldn't it be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?

60
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:12,881
No!

61
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,801
Attention, she looks like a hostage.
Waiting for orders, sir.

62
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:28,961
- We're going down.

63
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,841
- Looks like one of the muggers.

64
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:35,321
- I heard.

65
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,281
Who is she?, I can't see her face

66
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,001
- It's Oliveira, sir.

67
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,361
We got her, sir.

68
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,961
- Why the hell did they
give up one of their own?

69
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,481
I want everyone within 20 yards,
she can carry explosives.

70
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,761
- On the ground! Perimeter, perimeter!
- Explosion-proof protocol.

71
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:27,721
Repeat, anti-explosive protocol.
It may be a trap.

72
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,761
- On the ground! On the ground!
Perimeter of a possible bomb!

73
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,041
- Take off the clothes.

74
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,441
- Okay. Take off your boots and clothes.

75
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,521
Take off your boots and clothes!

76
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:53,401
Come on, let's go!

77
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:00,441
Take off your boots and clothes! Now!

78
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,601
The shirt, lift up the shirt!

79
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,321
- Reduce her.

80
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,241
- Get on the ground. Get on the ground!

81
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,361
Hands up.

82
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,401
Put your hands up.

83
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:14,681
Aah! Aah!

84
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:18,921
- Don't shoot. Repeat, do not fire.

85
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,481
Nobody touch that woman, I want her alive.

86
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:32,641
Tokio.

87
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:39,121
Tokio!

88
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,601
Freeze, freeze!

89
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,761
Fucking hell!

90
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:07,081
The risks are three: getting killed,
getting hurt,

91
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:10,441
to get caught. Today we're going to talk
about the third one.

92
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:14,761
Tokio, any idea what to do if you get caught?

93
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,521
A kick in the balls?

94
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:24,681
You must always have in mind what
the goal of this robbery is.

95
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:30,241
Win...
Time

96
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:37,241
Win time. And indeed, you must exhaust

97
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,441
every possible way to get it.

98
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:59,001
Oh, my stomach. Let's go.

99
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,201
I can't breathe.

100
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,481
You guys fucked me up, for fuck's sake.

101
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,961
Sir, the detainee says she's in severe pain,

102
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:10,321
says he can't breathe.
I seek medical assistance.

103
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,401
- All right, take her to a doctor.

104
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,441
- Acknowledged. Let's go.

105
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,241
It hurts. Carefully.

106
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,321
It hurts, it hurts. Oh, it hurts so much.

107
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:31,561
A little further back.
Holy shit.

108
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,601
You lied to us.

109
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,481
Are you telling us that no personal relationships

110
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,001
and Berlín calls you by your name?

111
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,481
Sergio?

112
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:12,201
Because that's your name, isn't it?

113
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,681
Tokio, maybe tomorrow, daylight,

114
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:17,841
we'll see things...
Tomorrow I'm not going to see anything.

115
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:20,521
I got into this because I trusted you,

116
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,641
because you were gonna be our guardian angel.

117
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,081
And guardian angels don't lie.

118
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:53,921
My name is Sergio.

119
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,601
Sergio Marquina.

120
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,041
My father was a robber.

121
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,001
He was killed in a shootout with the police

122
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:13,961
at the doors of a bank, it was he
who came up with the idea of the robbery.

123
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,961
Tokio, of all the ones who are about to enter,

124
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:21,041
you're the one with the hottest blood.

125
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:25,561
And there's gonna be a time when you think
everything's falling apart,

126
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,721
that it's all going wrong,

127
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,001
that you're all alone.

128
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,441
But I promise you that's not gonna happen.

129
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,201
I've got it all figured out.

130
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,121
And besides, I'm a lucky man.

131
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:50,601
You are a lucky guy

132
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:53,561
Tokio, I won't let you down.

133
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,721
I want you to remember it forever.

134
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,641
"The worst thing that can happen to you
when you run a robbery is:

135
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:09,441
First, get arrested for knocking out

136
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:11,361
the ex-husband of the inspector in charge."

137
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,041
Take his fingerprints and lock him up.

138
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,001
"Second, have them ask for your ID"
Your ID?

139
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,841
"And you can only give them a fake one.

140
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,201
Third, get your fingerprints taken.

141
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,841
And if, in addition, they match the ones that appeared

142
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:26,561
in a car that's part of the investigation, worse."

143
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:28,441
Take the tray and empty the pockets.

144
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,441
"Fourth, have them ask for your belongings.

145
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,881
Especially when these are the keys to the hangar.

146
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,681
where you have mounted the operation and
where they are going to escape

147
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:37,561
the thieves. And a bottle of poison..."

148
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,841
It's a medicine for a heart condition.

149
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:40,961
Digoxin is called.

150
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,001
"...with which you were going to kill
the inspector's mother...

151
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:45,201
a few hours ago."

152
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:47,401
Come with me.

153
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,281
Sit here until your statement is taken.

154
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,601
- Rafa.

155
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:18,561
"A few minutes ago the kidnappers

156
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:21,481
have literally thrown on a stretcher

157
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,441
a person bound and gagged,

158
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,441
that has been rescued by the troops

159
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,001
of Special Intervention.

160
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,441
This is Silene Oliveira,
one of the kidnappers

161
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,441
that remained locked in the factory,

162
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,041
and that she's being cared for by
the medical services.

163
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,441
that are in the security perimeter."

164
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,721
"Fifth, let your companions lose their heads."

165
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,601
Tokio lost its head.

166
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,161
She couldn't take it.

167
00:15:29,801 --> 00:15:30,881
And it's not easy.

168
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,081
But I had no choice but to give her.

169
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:45,521
Take your hands.

170
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,521
Please.

171
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,161
We're here risking our lives.

172
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:57,801
It doesn't take so much courage
to take your hands.

173
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:05,361
When a wound occurs, the platelets join together

174
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:06,721
to close it.

175
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:10,281
If they don't, the body finally dies.

176
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,801
There's been a wound and we need to unite.

177
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,961
- What the fuck are you talking about platelets?

178
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:20,161
- Río.
- What do you think, a preacher?

179
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:22,081
The leader of a cult?

180
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,401
Are you all going to travel
hand in hand into space with him?

181
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,321
- Río, you need to calm down. Now.

182
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:31,041
- I'm not reassured, you've sent Tokio to jail.

183
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:35,801
Don't have the guts to ask me to calm down,

184
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,441
she's my girlfriend, my girlfriend.

185
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,361
And you fucked up her life.

186
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,761
- It's the first love.

187
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,281
You're at the end of the summer
and you say goodbye to Susan

188
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,241
on the Côte d'Azur.
It looks like the end of the world,

189
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,201
but it's not.
- Shut the fuck up,

190
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,921
you fucking psychopath.
You have no fucking idea

191
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,561
of what you're saying, okay?

192
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:59,521
Is there anyone here who isn't crazy?

193
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:03,881
Moscú

194
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,201
Are you okay with Tokio?

195
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,401
- Son, he lost his papers.

196
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,001
We all saw it.

197
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:21,401
- Nairobi

198
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:27,721
- Here are some rules. We voted, she didn't accept it

199
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,521
and then his head went off.

200
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:34,041
- Denver.

201
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,481
You do see what a piece of shit this is, don't you?

202
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:37,841
- Of course I see it, man.

203
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:42,481
But he did the fucking Russian roulette to Berlín,
what do you think?

204
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,321
- Nothing fucking happened.

205
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,601
- But almost, we've been this close.

206
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:51,241
Wise up, kid, open your eyes.

207
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,721
Tokio lost her mind. We can't have a bomb

208
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,601
in here.
- I can't believe it.

209
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:01,321
You're all with Berlín, you're all
with a fucking psychopath.

210
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:05,761
- No, no, we're not all with Berlín,
we're all with the Profesor.

211
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,801
- With the Profesor? He is under arrest.

212
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:12,601
We've all seen it on TV.

213
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:15,681
He's not gonna call, he's not gonna be waiting for us

214
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:16,801
at the end of the tunnel.

215
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,321
Now you're gonna start with the two hours left.

216
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:23,881
for the control call, right?

217
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,121
Awesome.

218
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:28,801
Because it's the last one.

219
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:32,761
Let's see what the fuck you do
when he doesn't call.

220
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,081
I'm certainly not staying here to see it.

221
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:46,561
Hostages are gone, Tokio is gone.

222
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:50,201
I guess you don't care if I leave
too, do you?

223
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,921
- You know it doesn't matter, Río.

224
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,801
But it's your decision and we
respect it. Go ahead.

225
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:01,721
There you stay.

226
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,921
Well, someone come and close the door.

227
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,041
- Wait.

228
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:16,081
When you get out, take this and lift it.

229
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,801
Let them see that you come out in peace.

230
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:22,481
There are snipers, I don't want anything
to happen to you, take it.

231
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:24,921
Give me a hug.

232
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:29,841
I want it to go well for you

233
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,321
I want you to never stop believing
in love, it's beautiful.

234
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,521
Trust, trust, trust.

235
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:43,681
Hey, you have to empty your mind
so you can think clearly.

236
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,241
Trust, do it, let go.

237
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,281
Let go, that's it, that's it.

238
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,921
- You need to get some rest and that's it.

239
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:24,841
"Kill Berlín. Kill Berlín. Kill Berlín. Kill Berlín.

240
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:27,841
Kill Berlín. Kill Berlín.

241
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,201
Kill Berlín. Kill Berlín. Kill Berlín.

242
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,841
That was the only phrase that sounded in my head,

243
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:39,361
but there was no way,
no matter how much I thought,

244
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,201
I couldn't find a way to destroy Berlín's life

245
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,481
without taking Río's too.

246
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:47,921
I could tell how we were going to get out,
where the hangar was,

247
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,601
but those vengeances would also fall on Río,

248
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:53,641
my little Río. And I remembered
everything I had fought for

249
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,801
so my love would be in there."

250
00:20:57,561 --> 00:20:59,641
I think we can finish today's class here.

251
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:03,721
I'm hungry, aren't I?

252
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:09,881
Río.

253
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:13,601
Remember I told you we had to do

254
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,401
a facility?
Yes.

255
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,161
Well, the time has come.

256
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:36,681
Fucking hell.

257
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,721
That's some bachelor flat, huh, Profesor?

258
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,721
Are you bringing the girls here or what?

259
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:46,721
Let's get to work, come on, we've got a lot to do.

260
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,201
Fuck, Profesor, who did this botched job?

261
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,961
Eh... A company.

262
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,241
My balls a company, this smells
like brother-in-law

263
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,201
playing the handyman.
Well, I did it

264
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,681
with some tutorials I found on the Internet.

265
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:13,481
Well, that's some shitty tutorials, isn't it?

266
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:15,921
That's what you're for, isn't it?

267
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:47,881
That's it, I've installed the voice
modification program.

268
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,841
To talk to the police, you press MS.

269
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,081
To contact the museum, zero.
And that's it,

270
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,601
the modification is made by the program
as soon as you contact anyone.

271
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:00,081
Can I try it?
Yes.

272
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,361
"Talk to the robber."

273
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:17,001
Can you put on a voice that's not
a woman's voice?

274
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,121
Oh, I'm sorry.

275
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:22,441
"Bitch. Bastard. Faggot."

276
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:26,761
Okay, fuck, okay, okay.

277
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:32,601
Try it now.

278
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,361
You talk to the robber in command.

279
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:41,681
Okay, that's good.

280
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,201
Now we have to enter the illegal internet network.

281
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:48,401
To buy some illegal stuff.
On the deep web.

282
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:51,201
Deep Internet.

283
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:05,961
Can you explain to me what we're doing now?

284
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:09,081
I've deactivated all defenses, the wifi,
and we're entering

285
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,921
over Ethernet. I'm diverting data traffic

286
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,921
through a VPN through the Tor network.

287
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:15,601
Well, then...

288
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:18,521
Keep going.

289
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:34,601
That's it.

290
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,761
There's everything: there's rifles,
there's grenades,

291
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:39,921
there are rocket launchers...
This is like an outlet,

292
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,601
but with the arsenal of the USSR.
Look, a tank,

293
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,161
we could go into the factory with it
as the A-Team,

294
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,601
all with rifles...
Do you know what a Browning is?

295
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:48,721
Oh, yes, of course.

296
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:51,601
Okay, let's buy a Browning, assault rifles,

297
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:54,641
guns and ammunition.
A V-750 missile, dude.

298
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:57,161
That's amazing. Imagine messing with that

299
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:59,321
at the factory.
Open the doors and bam!

300
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,721
V-750 missile pointing directly at the faces
of all police officers.

301
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,721
And bam! Fuck it all.
He'd be gorgeous, dude.

302
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,801
Besides, look, it's not that expensive,
60 bitcoins.

303
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:14,681
It is... 150 000 euros or something like that
at the exchange rate.

304
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:16,841
Cheap.

305
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,841
Why did you take Río out of the plan?

306
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:34,721
Tell me.

307
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,041
I don't have to explain myself to you, but...

308
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:41,601
I don't think he was ready.

309
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,121
You're wrong.

310
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:47,521
Are you sure about that?

311
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,681
You've been working with him for months.

312
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:52,721
You know him and you know that his personality

313
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,761
is marked by deep immaturity.

314
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,721
He's not aware of what we're going to do,

315
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,361
out there the bullets are real, no extra lives.

316
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:02,201
He knows perfectly well what he's doing.
It is my responsibility

317
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,961
and I'm not putting a kid in all this.

318
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:06,801
I'll pay you a portion for the upheavals,

319
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:09,321
but I'm gonna leave him out.
Río is the best at its best

320
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:12,201
and you know it, that's why you chose him.

321
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:14,321
It's a fucking coconut.

322
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,601
The thing is, geniuses are weird.

323
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:20,681
You think you're an example of maturity?

324
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:24,161
Tell me, do you consider yourself
a normal person?

325
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:27,001
Do you think it's normal to sort your
shirts by colour?

326
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:30,921
Have you seen yourself? Tell me,
who buys your clothes,

327
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,441
your aunt the nun, Gertrudis?

328
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:39,361
What about this?

329
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:45,241
What's this? What's this?
Origami Figures,

330
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:47,161
is an ancient technique. Please...

331
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:49,601
Hey, what's the matter, you're afraid
I'll break your

332
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:51,161
paper dolls?

333
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:54,321
Hey, hey, welcome to Jurassic Park.

334
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,241
Oh, help, the dinosaur eats me.

335
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:14,281
What's the difference between this and
playing video games?

336
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:27,961
I'm so sorry, but it's not a decision

337
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:29,161
that's in your hand.

338
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:37,961
Yes, it is.

339
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,841
If Río goes, don't count on me.

340
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,161
I'm not mature enough either.

341
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,201
All right, then.

342
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:54,881
Maybe we'll all have our immaturity plot here.

343
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:58,001
And that makes us all a bit...

344
00:27:58,161 --> 00:27:59,121
Specials

345
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:02,441
Different.

346
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:07,161
Maybe that's not an impediment.

347
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:11,641
Maybe it's a virtue.

348
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,161
Maybe

349
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:19,921
I'm sure it is.

350
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:23,481
But don't tell me.

351
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,121
Tell it to him, who's behind the door.

352
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,721
Thank you very much, Profesor,
you won't regret it, I promise you.

353
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:42,401
Thank you.

354
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,561
You're the one who hits cops?

355
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,641
Well, I'll read you the penal code.

356
00:28:56,481 --> 00:29:00,481
Article 550, offence of assault on authority.

357
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:03,681
With penalties ranging from one to
four years in prison.

358
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,841
And we're gonna do everything we can to
make you stay four years

359
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,401
in the shade.
Could I, please,

360
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:11,481
talk to my lawyer?
Sure. Talk, talk,

361
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:12,921
you're gonna need.

362
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,401
No, but I need my cell phone,
I've got his number there.

363
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:19,841
It's been taken away with my
personal belongings.

364
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,521
Wait here, don't move.

365
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:28,521
- I'm sorry about the chick, because
among the bastards

366
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:33,041
of the cops and them, I prefer the kidnappers.

367
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,841
It's just that it's so great what they've done.

368
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,881
Well, let's see how it ends.

369
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,361
I'll tell you that, with all the kidnappers

370
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:42,561
shotgunned.

371
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,241
Oh, fuck.

372
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:08,041
Sons of bitches, for fuck's sake.

373
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:21,441
Look, Mr. Prieto.

374
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:23,121
Miss Tokio.

375
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:27,241
How long have you been questioning
women in panties?

376
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:29,681
Why did they give yourself?

377
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:33,321
Well, things happen.

378
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:35,881
Why'd they tie her to a stretcher?

379
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,801
I had my differences with the person in charge.

380
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:42,161
I tortured him for a while and it
seems he didn't take it too well.

381
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:43,281
Oh, yeah.

382
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:47,241
I want you to know that your money
is still insured.

383
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:49,641
Just as I looked for you a first time,
I would look for you

384
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:51,881
when you got out of jail and you'd have it.

385
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:54,521
By this I mean that the plan goes ahead,

386
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:57,321
because in the worst case scenario, over the years.

387
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,921
you'll get your money. And in the best...

388
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:05,961
Well, I'll try to get you out of the hole
when everything's a little calm.

389
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:09,681
That the plan goes forward means
not talking to the police,

390
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:13,601
not talk to the judge and
not talk to the prisoners, right?

391
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:14,801
That's it.

392
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:17,441
- I'd rather bite my tongue,
chew it and swallow it

393
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:18,841
than to give anyone away.

394
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:24,801
Well, let's see, it's an effective method.
It's a bit rough, but effective.

395
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:27,321
I was going to propose, however,
something a little more...

396
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:29,881
More subtle.

397
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,561
An interrogation is like a game of expertise,

398
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:34,921
like flying a kite that at any moment

399
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:37,041
can fall to the ground. With the right hand

400
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:41,441
you're letting go of the thread

401
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,561
of the truth.

402
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,921
Exactly how many of you are in there?

403
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:51,321
Eight.

404
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:54,321
The same eight of us who planned the coup

405
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:55,601
in a town in Toledo.

406
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:58,241
And how much time did you take to prepare the coup

407
00:31:58,401 --> 00:31:59,441
in the town of Toledo?

408
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,321
Five months.

409
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:04,961
When the kite takes flight, when they consider
that there is truth

410
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:08,001
in what you say and be sure that they
can get something out of it

411
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:13,121
of you, with your left hand you pull the thread
and stop the kite.

412
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,041
You entertain them.

413
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,521
Do you wear boxers, Colonel?

414
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:23,121
It's just that I've always thought
that the military

415
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:25,921
like to wear that hanging around.
Am I wrong?

416
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:27,041
hanging around

417
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:33,961
- Can anyone tell me why you guys fucking have

418
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,081
this woman like that?

419
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:39,921
Sorry about the treatment.

420
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:46,761
Good to see you again, Miss Tokio.

421
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:51,601
This time we are going to be practical,
I ask and you answer.

422
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,801
Who's the Profesor?

423
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:17,121
Yes?
Hi, I need to talk

424
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:19,641
with Inspector Raquel Murillo, it's very urgent.

425
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:22,161
Who's calling?
It is a private matter.

426
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:27,041
Inspector Murillo, urgent call.

427
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:32,001
Listen, I'm not moving from here.

428
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:37,561
Subject reserved.

429
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:41,201
- Who's that? Raquel, thank God.

430
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:45,001
I'm Salva, I'm calling from the police station,
I'm under arrest.

431
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:48,281
I'm accused of assaulting a service agent,

432
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,521
your ex-husband, more specifically.
How?

433
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:54,281
I'm handcuffed and they're talking
about four years in jail.

434
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:57,361
and I don't know what else. But...
What police station are you in?

435
00:33:57,521 --> 00:34:00,201
Canillas.
Well, quiet,

436
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:03,281
as soon as I can, I'll be there, huh?
Thanks.

437
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,921
Let's move on.

438
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,441
He was about to tell me about the Profesor.

439
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,321
You'd look prettier with short hair, inspector.

440
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:24,241
That's how she looks like a mother.

441
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,721
It's just that I'm getting the urge
to tell you everything.

442
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:31,641
Perfect, because I'm here with open arms

443
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,161
waiting for you to do it.

444
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:37,601
Look on the bright side,
that's the end of living on the run.

445
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:40,081
Now it's your turn to start from scratch.

446
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:44,241
You want to know how it all started?

447
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,481
The Profesor picked me up.

448
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:52,921
With a red Seat Ibiza.

449
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,961
While the police were ambushing me.

450
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,161
No

451
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,521
No, no, it started earlier.

452
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:13,161
A boy, his name was Miguel.

453
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,921
He took my panties down in front of the class.

454
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:20,801
Can you believe they expelled me

455
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:22,801
instead of that six-year-old son of a bitch?

456
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:27,241
That's where everything started to twist.

457
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:49,841
Hey.

458
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:53,281
Is it true what they've said before,

459
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:54,961
You ever beat up a cop?

460
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,081
You have to claim it was a fight.

461
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:08,921
If you're the only one who hit him,
you're fucked.

462
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,361
I see you in one piece, actually.

463
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:21,961
Excuse me, could I go to the bathroom?

464
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:40,921
Keep an eye on him.

465
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,761
- I didn't come here to be anybody's nurse.

466
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:47,881
Not to put up with anyone's little
speeches, not to do shitty therapies

467
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:52,481
I've had to shut the fuck up before

468
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:54,761
for not screwing up the group
any more than it already is.

469
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,201
- It's a detail.

470
00:36:57,681 --> 00:37:01,041
Worry about your companions.
- You know what really worries me?

471
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:05,481
The Profesor, Berlín. He's not here, it's just you.

472
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,561
And he's the head of all this.

473
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:10,121
- And precisely because he's the head of all this.

474
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:13,241
he drew up a perfect plan and that's
the one we're going to follow,

475
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:16,281
step by step, without doing anything he
hadn't foreseen.

476
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,241
- But you've already done something unforeseen,

477
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,361
you've taken Tokio out.

478
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:22,521
- Tokio will get its share if she behaves well

479
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:25,401
and it doesn't count for anything.
- Bullshit!

480
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:27,281
The thing about having her share
was if she got caught,

481
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:29,681
Not if you got her out of here and
threw her out like a bitch

482
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:32,521
down the stairs to the lions.
And with the bad shit he's got,

483
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,921
Do you know what she has done?
He must have thrown it all away.

484
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:38,121
And the GEOS will be in the hangar digging
the tunnel on the other side.

485
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:40,281
to get in here.
- I write down your comments

486
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:42,961
for the suggestion box.
But, unfortunately,

487
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:45,641
as you've seen with Río,
that's not gonna do any good,

488
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:48,521
because this... It's patriarchy!

489
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:57,561
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means I'm in charge here!

490
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,041
And if you don't want it to happen like Río or Tokio,

491
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,881
I advise you to take a lime blossom.

492
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:13,041
What the hell is wrong with you, Nairobi,
your period has been synchronized

493
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,321
with Tokio?

494
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:28,761
You and I are alike.

495
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,401
I don't think my life is as exciting as yours.

496
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:37,481
No, I don't think so either.

497
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:42,681
But it mustn't be easy to wear a
skirt in the police force.

498
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,241
Neither is in a gang of muggers.

499
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:49,561
We are few.

500
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:52,881
That's why we have to be putting the ovaries

501
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,401
on the table all the time.

502
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,921
Really.

503
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:00,081
Don't you think it's exhausting?

504
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:03,401
Silene, I think you're wasting my time

505
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:06,641
and you're fucking all your chances

506
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:07,961
of sentence reduction.

507
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:11,481
Every minute you lose costs you a year.

508
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:19,161
Look, you're young and pretty now.
And you have everything in place.

509
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,241
Twelve years from now, you'll still be fine,

510
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:27,281
maybe with some interesting wrinkles.
But if you get out of jail

511
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:28,881
in 24 years,

512
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,241
you will have entered the menopause terrain

513
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:36,441
and that must be pretty fucked up, right, Prieto?

514
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:41,601
I know it from his mother.

515
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:47,121
And I'm not talking about hot flashes,
I'm talking about the feeling

516
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:49,721
of having lost something important.

517
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:55,081
Something profoundly yours,
which has vanished forever.

518
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,921
Your life.

519
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:01,521
Inspector.

520
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:07,161
Do you really see me in a garden
raising a family,

521
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,201
changing diapers?

522
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,041
Please.

523
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,761
Look, I'm gonna give you one last chance

524
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,841
before I call the judge.

525
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,121
If you don't talk, goodbye,
you're going to jail now.

526
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:25,961
And you will have lost collaboration,
repentance and extenuating circumstances,

527
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:29,521
what they come to be between
10 and 12 years of life.

528
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,321
So think carefully before you
throw it all away.

529
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:37,161
You want some advice?

530
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:40,721
Oh, sure.

531
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,761
Think of a nice place,

532
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,641
at some point in your life when
you've been really happy.

533
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:52,681
And take a deep breath, reflect.

534
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:09,881
Tokio!

535
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:16,161
I can't.

536
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:20,441
- How can you? If you've been put in
giant killers.

537
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:23,041
It's a hypnotic sedative.

538
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:27,121
Relax and enjoy.

539
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:32,761
- Water.

540
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,121
Please.

541
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:48,441
- Go back to sleep.

542
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:52,041
- How can I fucking sleep?
If I don't stop dreaming about Tokio.

543
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:54,641
- Tokio is a motherfucker.

544
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:56,641
- What?

545
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:59,521
- Do you know what your girlfriend did
with the only illusion of my life?

546
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:02,521
When was the last time he saw you,
when he was three?

547
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:06,201
He put it in his mouth,
chewed it and spit it in my face.

548
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:09,321
He doesn't have a fucking memory of you.
Shut the fuck up.

549
00:42:09,481 --> 00:42:11,681
He doesn't even have a memory of you,
he won't recognize you.

550
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,201
You know what the worst thing about it is?

551
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:21,441
She's right.

552
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:24,841
He's right. He's right.

553
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,761
I was going to kidnap a child who doesn't
even know who I am.

554
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:36,961
I was going to kidnap a child

555
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:39,681
who doesn't even know who I am.

556
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:48,121
And now I don't even know what
to do with the money.

557
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:57,961
- look, maybe not now, but a few years from now

558
00:42:58,121 --> 00:42:59,161
you go, you look for him and...

559
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:01,921
And you explain it to him.

560
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:07,521
You say, "Fuck, look, I'm your mother.

561
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:10,721
I live in Jamaica with a lot of money

562
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:14,201
and if you want me to tell you
the rest of the story,

563
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:15,961
I buy you a plane and you come to see me."

564
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:18,921
Besides, you're a young woman.

565
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:21,121
But you have two ovaries, don't you?

566
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:23,121
You can have another one.

567
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:26,761
- Oh, yeah.

568
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:41,801
Five minutes, not one more.

569
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:49,081
Easy, right?

570
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,201
Oh, look.

571
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:55,601
You'd give me a son, would you?

572
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:58,481
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah?

573
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:00,681
- How do you want it, blond or dark?

574
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,041
- I'm not kidding.

575
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:07,801
If I get out of here,
I'm gonna need a reason to live.

576
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:12,201
- Nairobi, what do you want me to say?

577
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:14,761
Having a child to have a reason to live...

578
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,921
I don't know, I don't think
it's a very good plan.

579
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:20,441
- You don't?
- Besides, I'm with Tokio.

580
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,641
- I'm not asking you to marry me,

581
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:26,161
I'm just asking for a little sperm.

582
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:29,281
Two little pushes and I'm pregnant.

583
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:33,161
Because look, with how handsome
you are, how smart...

584
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:35,561
And that pretty little smile of yours.

585
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:38,161
And it's that easy. Hold it right there.

586
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:41,761
It's that easy, huh?
You trade one son for another,

587
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:44,521
what difference does it make?
Because in the end the only important thing

588
00:45:44,681 --> 00:45:47,401
is to have a reason to live.
- Fucking hell!

589
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:50,721
Fuck, then you say that Tokio is crazy.
You're worse.

590
00:45:51,921 --> 00:45:53,761
- Where are you going?
- Fuck it.

591
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,001
- No, no, hold still.

592
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:59,081
No, you have to fuck Berlín in a way

593
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:00,441
that's not turning himself in.

594
00:46:20,721 --> 00:46:23,441
Salva.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

595
00:46:23,601 --> 00:46:25,921
I really do. I screwed up, I'm so sorry.

596
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:29,281
But what did that animal do to you?
No, it was not his fault alone,

597
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:33,281
I... Well, I brought up the subject
of what he's done to you,

598
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:35,521
about the mistreatment and your sister.

599
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:38,241
Fucking hell.
Well, I'm really sorry,

600
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:40,001
I'm not like that, I don't
know what happened to me.

601
00:46:40,161 --> 00:46:42,161
But my blood was boiling.

602
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:46,041
I'm not a violent man,
I've never hit anyone, ever.

603
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:49,441
I'm more of a quiet talker.

604
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:50,641
Have you defended yourself?

605
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:56,001
Well, I'm no Mohamed Ali,

606
00:46:58,241 --> 00:47:01,401
but I've got my pride and I've hit him,

607
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:03,761
I've hit him.

608
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,961
But my body is like a punching bag,

609
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:12,001
I think he beat me.
Let me see.

610
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,361
Wait.

611
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,521
Fucking hell.

612
00:47:20,681 --> 00:47:23,521
I'm calling a doctor right now
to see that, don't worry.

613
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:25,881
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.

614
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:33,721
I'm telling you I have a boyfriend
and you don't have time

615
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:36,721
to beat him up?
- Hey, hey, he hit me,

616
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:37,841
I haven't even touched him.

617
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:41,681
- I want you to drop the complaint now.
- Yes?

618
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:43,401
You take back the one you have against me.

619
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:47,441
- This is going to come in handy
at the trial we have pending,

620
00:47:47,601 --> 00:47:49,761
the fact that you also hit my partner.

621
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:52,761
- He knocked me unconscious,
he's fucking Chuck Norris with glasses.

622
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:54,961
- Look, you tell your lawyer the bullshit.

623
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:56,881
This isn't gonna help you with custody.

624
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,001
- Raquel, I didn't do anything,
I didn't touch it.

625
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:01,641
- Oh, you don't? Come with me.

626
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:06,361
I'm Inspector Raquel Murillo from headquarters.

627
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:09,321
I want to know who has taken the attestation

628
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:11,681
of the complaint against this man.
And I want to know

629
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:14,441
why he hasn't been seen by a doctor,
given that he's been beaten

630
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:15,561
by this agent.

631
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,121
Salva, open your shirt.

632
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:44,641
This man wants to file a complaint
for abuse of authority,

633
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:48,081
You have to make a declaration of injury.
For the declaration of first instance

634
00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:49,361
you are witnesses.
- Raquel,

635
00:48:49,521 --> 00:48:52,441
I don't know how he got these wounds,
I swear I didn't touch him.

636
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,921
- The victim has contusions in the chest,
ribs and abdomen.

637
00:48:57,081 --> 00:48:58,761
He's clearly been beaten up.

638
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:01,921
Is someone taking the statement, yes or no?

639
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,521
- Raquel.

640
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,001
All right, stop it.

641
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:09,921
I'm withdrawing the complaint.
- Very well.

642
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:12,201
Then he withdraws his.

643
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:14,041
Have the handcuffs removed.

644
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:20,001
Where are your personal belongings?

645
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:22,441
Raquel, I wouldn't want to look
like one of these.

646
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:25,321
of conspiracy theory,
but my fingerprints

647
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:27,641
and data are around, I don't...
Ok.

648
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:30,041
Where's the attestation of his arrest?

649
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:54,881
Let's go, Salva.

650
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:08,921
"I've never felt so lost.

651
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:13,241
I didn't have anything anymore.

652
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,721
I just had to decide whether or not
to betray out my companions

653
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:24,441
and seek a minimal clemency from the
judge for collaboration."

654
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:25,681
You want to say something?

655
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,041
Could somebody make me some
fried eggs, please?

656
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:49,961
Fuck, I've been eating garbage
for four days.

657
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,841
"Tokio, I won't let you down,
I've got it all figured out.

658
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:03,961
And besides, I'm a lucky man.

659
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:06,441
I want you to remember it forever.

660
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:09,761
Tokio, I won't let you down."

661
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:14,361
I can't take it anymore.

662
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:17,281
It's been 30 boxes like this.

663
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:21,001
These people don't care if you
have a gunshot wound.

664
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:25,881
I don't even want to think about the
after-effects we're gonna have,

665
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,241
mostly psychological.

666
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:30,441
Having to come here to work every day.

667
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,241
Having to relive all this.

668
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:35,641
Well, it's gonna be hard on all of us, huh?

669
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:38,761
It's even likely that some of us

670
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:42,401
let's go into post-traumatic shock.
Well, I have all the ballots

671
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,881
I don't know what could be more traumatic
than losing everything.

672
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:51,001
I've lost everything and that
doesn't make up for it.

673
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:52,641
Not by a long shot.

674
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:56,481
As for the million euros... I laugh.

675
00:51:56,961 --> 00:51:59,601
Anybody can trust these people,
they've got us locked up

676
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:01,961
like we're cattle.
Will you shut up now?

677
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,041
I beg your pardon?
Shut the fuck up.

678
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:09,881
- Alison, please.

679
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:12,961
- I'm sick of hearing this guy complain.

680
00:52:15,961 --> 00:52:18,201
If you're so bad, why don't
you do something?

681
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:23,721
I was complaining about everything, too.

682
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:27,961
From my parents, from the school where I was bullied...

683
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:30,681
I swallowed and swallowed.

684
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:33,281
Well, it's over.

685
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,161
- Now it's normal for you to see
everything very black.

686
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,401
- On the contrary.

687
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:40,801
You guys have been fucked up,

688
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:44,361
but it opened my eyes.

689
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,641
I've realized that we are what we eat.

690
00:52:46,801 --> 00:52:49,721
And I don't know about you,
but I'm not eating any more shit.

691
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,081
So I'm gonna go.

692
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:55,041
- Alison, don't talk nonsense.
I'm your tutor

693
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:57,521
and I'm responsible for your safety, so...

694
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:59,001
- You're here for the money.

695
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:02,441
You'll be comfortable with your
little pinch.

696
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:05,521
and being accomplices to this mob.
But I don't.

697
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:09,081
Besides, it's not that hard to get out of here either.

698
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,521
Get out of here?

699
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,521
How?

700
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:19,081
I'm gonna hurt myself.

701
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,561
They'll take me somewhere else
and I can escape there.

702
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:27,121
- No, no and no.
Don't even think about doing that nonsense.

703
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:30,801
Mercedes, Mercedes, let the girl
explain herself.

704
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:35,201
I've seen it more than ten times since
we've been here.

705
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:38,521
They press the button and the door only
takes

706
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:41,921
four seconds to open.
Four seconds and run away

707
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:43,881
that's all it takes.

708
00:53:45,281 --> 00:53:47,441
Four seconds is more than enough time

709
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:48,681
to get shot.

710
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:50,921
We'll see about that.

711
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:27,641
What's the matter, hostages? Do you sleep
comfortably thinking on your million euros?

712
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:32,761
Well, keep dreaming, because nobody's
gonna give it to you.

713
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:36,601
It's a lie, just like no one has released

714
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:39,521
any of your comrades,
the ones who chose to go out

715
00:54:39,681 --> 00:54:41,761
instead of the million, no.
They are locked up

716
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:44,961
two floors below you.
- This one's an asshole.

717
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:48,121
- Chained to a pipe. It was a strategy

718
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:51,041
to keep you tame like sheep

719
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:54,201
working for us. But smiling,

720
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:57,521
because here you have to be
always smiling!

721
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,441
Isn't it, Don Andrés de Fonollosa,

722
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:02,481
that we don't want bad faces?

723
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:05,841
- Are you done yet?

724
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:08,401
- We're not going out through the
hole you're digging,

725
00:55:08,561 --> 00:55:11,481
No, we're going out for one that goes straight

726
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,161
in the vault.

727
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:14,481
Aah!

728
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:16,121
Aah!

729
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:22,041
- What you've done is high treason, Río.

730
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,001
Unforgivable.

731
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:25,801
Let's go.

732
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:31,921
- Aah! Aah!

733
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:42,561
Anything new?

734
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:44,681
- No, she didn't say anything.

735
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:48,681
Apparently, Miss Tokio has no
interest in collaborating.

736
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:52,961
- Colonel, one question.

737
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:56,361
Did Deputy Inspector Rubio mention
anything to you

738
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:57,881
about a spoon?

739
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,521
- A spoon?
No, why?

740
00:56:00,681 --> 00:56:03,361
- Ángel had it analyzed before the accident,

741
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:05,921
the prints match the subject

742
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:08,441
who forced the zeta
to threaten the Russian.

743
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:11,041
It's the same person
who helps them from the outside.

744
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:13,721
- And who the hell is he?
- I don't know.

745
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,961
Looks like the same guy who tampered with Ángel's car

746
00:56:17,121 --> 00:56:19,761
so he'd have the accident.
But only Ángel knows that.

747
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,361
And her.

748
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:36,081
Tell me one thing.

749
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:43,321
Are you silent for everyone or
just for Aníbal Cortés?

750
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:48,721
You look very much in love
in these pictures.

751
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:56,681
What would you say if I offer
you a two for one?

752
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:59,521
Like happy hour.

753
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:01,801
The same deal I'm offering you,
for him.

754
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:04,761
Mitigating, repentance and collaboration.

755
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:08,401
That's as long as the information
you give us

756
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:10,721
Help to put an end to this nightmare.

757
00:57:10,881 --> 00:57:13,161
- We're talking one-third of the sentence.

758
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:17,921
That's impossible. We have crimes to
resurrect several times

759
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:20,601
in jail.
No judge can promise us that.

760
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:24,161
Except you.

761
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:28,241
Look, I don't know what they told you,
but you regret it,

762
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:31,921
you collaborate and help save the
lives of 50 victims,

763
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,721
and I assure you that any judge
is going to be benevolent.

764
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:37,081
- Hannibal Cortés has no blood crimes,

765
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:39,801
I'd be out in five years.
- At 24 years old,

766
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:43,721
like I just got out of college.
I think it's a better plan

767
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:47,121
Than to end up like your last boyfriend,
don't you think?

768
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:00,641
It was a bad idea to talk to
the hostages, Río.

769
00:58:02,721 --> 00:58:05,601
- You can get me out like Tokio
now, huh? Tied up.

770
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:08,321
Because I'm not gonna shut up.
- I trust Tokio,

771
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:11,681
but you're a worthless little boy.

772
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:15,361
It's a pity.
Look at the paradox, Helsinki.

773
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:20,441
Tokio's gonna shut up to protect him.

774
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:26,561
And yet, you're gonna disappear without her knowing.

775
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:30,241
- What are you gonna do, huh?
- What you shouted for me.

776
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:35,321
Execute you.

777
00:58:36,801 --> 00:58:38,561
Indeed, you have lost your mind.

778
00:58:39,361 --> 00:58:43,521
I can't let you go, and I can't
let you stay either,

779
00:58:43,681 --> 00:58:47,081
what you told the hostages ended
up condemning you

780
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:49,001
and my pulse isn't going to tremble.

781
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:53,721
Aah!

782
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,801
Well, it will shake a little.

783
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:12,561
It's important that you face
death with humor.

784
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,801
"To those of us who do things
unconsciously

785
00:59:19,281 --> 00:59:22,081
it's not that we don't care about
the consequences, no,

786
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:24,681
we care as much as anyone else.

787
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:28,921
We just can't see them until it's too late.

788
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:32,281
We only see those consequences when
they're in front of us.

789
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:33,401
of our noses."

790
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,161
You want to say your last words?

791
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,361
- There's still time to learn
from your mistakes.

792
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:44,481
and stop being a piece of shit.
- Oh, my goodness, Helsinki!

793
00:59:44,641 --> 00:59:46,841
This boy has just come of age.

794
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:50,201
If you had lived longer, you
could have been

795
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:52,201
Paulo Coelho's successor.

796
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:55,801
Too bad, the world's gonna
have to miss it.

797
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:57,441
- Berlín!

798
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:00,921
What the fuck are you doing?
- Put the fucking gun down.

799
01:00:01,081 --> 01:00:03,241
- The time for allegations is over.

800
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:06,281
Unfortunately, democracy has only
brought us displeasure.

801
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:09,081
and I just passed sentence.
- Enough of this bullshit,

802
01:00:09,241 --> 01:00:12,521
that we're very nervous.
Berlín, let's not fuck around anymore.

803
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:42,721
Berlín, we can't keep fucking around.

804
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:46,721
- Come on down.

805
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:49,241
Berlín.

806
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:02,001
You'd better put the gun down, otherwise,

807
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:06,121
you're gonna fuck with pain,
I found your painkillers.

808
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:17,881
- What are you going to do, Nairobi?
Break them one by one

809
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:21,441
like Tokio did?
- As I am with the the period...

810
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:25,641
What a bitch we women are, isn't it?

811
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:28,921
And what a tempered we get when
they step on our asses.

812
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:48,841
- You son of a bitch!

813
01:01:57,841 --> 01:02:00,121
- Berlín, you have a missed call, my love.

814
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:05,001
- Ok, man, ok. That's it.

815
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:12,801
All right, you've made your choice.
Bad, but you have chosen. Take her away.

816
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:18,041
"And with that clarity I saw myself
at the trial, in jail.

817
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:20,521
And I knew the inspector was right,

818
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:22,921
that it wasn't worth sacrificing for a plan

819
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:26,161
that had already failed, because
of the Profesor's plan.

820
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:28,601
And more thinking that he had also deceived me."

821
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:30,841
Sergio!

822
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:37,121
His name is Sergio.
- Wait a minute. Let her speak.

823
01:02:40,601 --> 01:02:42,361
The Profesor's name is Sergio Marquina.

824
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,441
And the blow occurred to his father.

825
01:02:49,121 --> 01:02:51,081
And who's the person outside?

826
01:02:53,361 --> 01:02:56,281
- Inspector, they're calling from
inside the factory.

827
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:06,681
How are you, how was your day?

828
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,081
Well, I think good.

829
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:11,681
To tell you the truth, I was a
little worried about you.

830
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:14,361
I thought we weren't going to talk anymore,

831
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:16,801
something terrible had happened.

832
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:19,041
Sergio.

833
01:03:23,241 --> 01:03:26,241
Thank you very much for your concern,
Inspector, but...

834
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:30,761
I'm a lucky man, never forget that.

835
01:03:32,801 --> 01:03:36,121
I was just calling to say hello,
I'll let you interrogate Tokio,

836
01:03:36,281 --> 01:03:40,201
has a lot of things to tell you.
And when you're done, call me.

837
01:03:42,641 --> 01:03:44,041
I'm not moving from here.

838
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:57,761
What do you have to tell me?

839
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:00,761
I've been kicked out to give
you a message in person.

840
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,801
We've got a hydrogen bomb in there

841
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:05,081
of 17 megatons.

842
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:08,721
We're gonna blow it up tomorrow at 12:00.

843
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:11,841
I'd like to talk to a priest.

844
01:04:13,121 --> 01:04:14,401
I need to confess.

845
01:04:15,841 --> 01:04:20,001
All right, let's apply for unconditional
incommunicated prison.

846
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,441
Gómez, write the report and emphasize

847
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:26,241
in his lack of cooperation and repentance.

848
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:28,321
Have her admitted to the nearest prison.

849
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:29,601
Lobo, take her away.

850
01:04:45,201 --> 01:04:48,321
Control call.
Everything goes like silk around here.

851
01:04:48,481 --> 01:04:52,561
Like silk? Like silk is Tokio
is being interrogated

852
01:04:52,721 --> 01:04:53,921
by the police?

853
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:56,201
Like silk is that you've been about

854
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:58,841
to execute Río?
Berlín, what are you doing?

855
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:08,201
Profesor, it's Nairobi.
Berlín is in no condition,

856
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:11,081
so from now on I'm in charge.

857
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:16,521
The matriarchy begins.

858
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:38,121
We have to do something,
steal a gun from them.

859
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:40,881
Where do we get a gun?
- Changing one of them

860
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,121
for one of the fake ones.

861
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:47,561
His colleague Silene Oliveira is going
to be remanded in custody

862
01:05:47,721 --> 01:05:48,961
Tonight without bail.

863
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:53,081
Nairobi is now in command.
- You tell me,

864
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:56,001
Are you with me or against me?

865
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:01,641
I'm releasing 11 hostages.
I want a journalist to come in.

866
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,361
and a camera to cover the news
from the inside.

867
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:12,841
Let's go. Let's go.
I ditch this from the cider in a few days

868
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:15,481
and you and I are going to a
Caribbean country.

869
01:06:17,401 --> 01:06:20,201
I'll go get the gun, wish me luck.

870
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:28,801
We move on to Plan Cameroon.

871
01:06:30,121 --> 01:06:32,881
Sub-inspector Rubio is coming out of the coma.

872
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:35,761
You're gonna have to show up
there and check if it's a trap.

873
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:37,441
And if it isn't, finish him off.

874
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,521
Let's set up the operation,
but we'll be there.

875
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,521
to catch him like a cat to a rat.

876
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:48,761
We're out of here, quick.

877
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:50,721
The hostages, damn it!
- Hey!

878
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:52,961
- Don't open the door!
