I'm willing to bet one of them
was in the coroner's office.

166
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,452
Since learning
Merlyn was alive,

167
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,904
the League has hunted
him all over the globe.

168
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:49,373
Running down
every rumor,

169
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,242
following every whisper.

170
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:53,244
And one of those whispers
put Merlyn back in Starling.

171
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,962
She tracked him here.

172
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:56,998
We are going
to retrace her steps.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,916
- You said you found evidence on her person?
- Yes.

174
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:00,585
Roy.

175
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,336
We found a blank piece
of paper in Sara's boot,

176
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:04,422
but why would she be carrying
a blank piece of paper?

177
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,425
Do you have a flame?

178
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:16,150
Unbelievable.

179
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:18,936
My father had a notebook
with hidden writing just like this.

180
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,739
The notebook he received from
Merlyn, I imagine.

181
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,608
This is ghost ink.

182
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,910
One of the means the League
employs for concealing secrets.

183
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,528
It's Sara's handwriting.

184
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,530
Notes from her surveillance
of Merlyn.

185
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:31,648
Oliver, there's not much
to go on here.

186
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,316
There's a couple
of things.

187
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:35,368
Jansen,
question mark.

188
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:39,623
Dad help,

189
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,324
question mark.

190
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:44,077
Sara reached out
to Lance.

191
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,379
If Lance knew Merlyn was alive,
don't you think he would have told you?

192
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,665
Only if she told him.

193
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,717
What matters
is what he told her.

194
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:54,004
And how do we find that out?

195
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:56,006
[Siren]
So, gentlemen,

196
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:58,008
word of advice-- next time
you arrest a bookie,

197
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,343
please make sure the chief is not
one of his clients.

198
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:02,679
Now, that's what the chief
told me to tell you, ok,

199
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:03,813
but as far
as I'm concerned,

200
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,582
you just keep
doing your jobs.

201
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:08,018
First round tonight's on me.
Please, get out of here.

202
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,402
Buying rounds?

203
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:11,238
Ah, buying love.

204
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,406
The fastest way to a cop's heart is
through his liver.

205
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,858
How you feeling?

206
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,027
I'm fine.
Do you have a minute?

207
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:18,662
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:20,363
I have
to talk to you.

209
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:22,749
It's about Sara.

210
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:25,418
She, um...

211
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,204
She called me.

212
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,939
She said that she was
looking into something.

213
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:32,175
Something
called Jansen?

214
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:35,128
Um...

215
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,880
Ahem.

216
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:39,182
Uh, yeah, someone.

217
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:40,967
Ken Zhi Jansen.

218
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,220
I hooked her up with his
last known address.

219
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,355
Sara was here.

220
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,440
She asked me not
to say anything to you,

221
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:49,059
and I should have.

222
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:50,860
Maybe I should have,
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:53,363
It's ok. She was--

224
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:55,732
she's in a mysterious
line of work.

225
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:59,236
Oh, yeah. One I hope
you're not getting mixed up with.

226
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:02,155
No. I'm just doing
Sara a favor.

227
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:06,159
And her?

228
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:11,081
I'll be right back.

229
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,088
What are you doing here?

230
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,390
Oliver told me of his plan
to involve you

231
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:22,092
in the hunt for
Sara's killer.

232
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:23,994
I have a handle on it.

233
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,845
- Your father doesn't know, does he?
- No.

234
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:27,347
He doesn't.

235
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:29,266
And he can't.
He has a heart condition.

236
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,351
He has the right
to avenge his daughter.

237
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,320
That is none
of your business.

238
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:35,021
Sara was everything
I hold dear in this life,

239
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:36,740
which is every bit
of my business.

240
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,608
And what would she say
if she was here now?

241
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,993
Hey. I almost
didn't recognize you

242
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:41,778
without
your Halloween costume.

243
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,781
Is Sara back in town, too?

244
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:46,416
No, she is not.

245
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,787
But she told me
to tell you

246
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,922
that she misses you
very much.

247
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:58,962
The address I gave
your sister for Jansen.

248
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:02,215
Now she promised me there wouldn't
be any, you know, assassinating.

249
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:03,600
Is that still the case?

250
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:05,218
I assure you,
Mr. Lance,

251
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,103
the only
objective here

252
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,438
is justice.

253
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:20,835
This was the next lead
Sara was going to follow?

254
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:22,886
Jansen's
a Buddhist monk.

255
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,053
Nine years ago,

256
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:25,805
he was facing
deportation to China.

257
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,390
Merlyn bankrolled
his defense.

258
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,092
And Jansen returns the favor
by giving Merlyn asylum

259
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:31,344
- in his garden.
- Monastery.

260
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,480
We should divide our forces,
take our flanking positions.

261
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:36,266
I agree,
but not--

262
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:41,104
Never understood what
Sara saw in her in the first place.

263
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:42,650
Split up,
but be careful.

264
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:43,877
Copy that.

265
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:53,176
John: Oliver,
we found Jansen.

266
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,061
Negative.

267
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:58,097
I have eyes on him.

268
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:02,268
Whoever's up there
is not Jansen.

269
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:09,275
Jansen sensei,
I am Nyssa, daughter

270
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:10,860
of Ra's al Ghul.
Heir to the demon.

271
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:13,279
You will tell me where I can
find Malcolm Merlyn

272
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:16,032
or I will kill you
where you sit.

273
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:24,173
Hello, Nyssa.

274
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:35,468
Where is he?!

275
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,999
What's going on?

276
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,167
Did you find
Sara's killer?

277
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:02,069
We have a suspect.

278
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,652
Malcolm Merlyn's alive.

279
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,571
Sara was here
looking for him.

280
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,789
We think
he found her first.

281
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,158
- And where is he now?
- We're working on that.

282
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,661
He got away from us
earlier tonight.

283
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,630
But not before
I hit him with an arrow

284
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,632
laced with particulate
nanotechnology.

285
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:21,752
Felicity wrote a program that tracks
the nanites using GPS.

286
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,420
The tracer arrow.

287
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:23,422
Yeah.

288
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,232
You had a shot at Merlyn
and you didn't kill him?

289
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,161
I tagged him.

290
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:29,011
With a flesh wound!

291
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,095
He's marked.

292
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,148
There's nowhere in the world
he can go where I can't find him.

293
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,983
And when you do?

294
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,936
I'm not a killer
anymore, Laurel.

295
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,571
Merlyn is.

296
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,822
He killed Tommy

297
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,025
and 502 other innocent people.

298
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:46,755
How many more people
are going to have to die

299
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,529
before you put him down?

300
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,947
Do you think that's
what your sister would want?

301
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,366
- Yes. I do.
- Let me speak with her.

302
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,713
Merlyn may try
to contact Thea.

303
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,381
I'm on it.

304
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,636
The tracer arrow
program...

305
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,606
You have Felicity monitoring
remote from Central City?

306
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,775
No, she told me
an idiot could run it.

307
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:22,129
I will try very hard not
to take that personally.

308
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,731
I'll be on the streets.

309
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,066
Talk me in when
you have his location.

310
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,834
Copy that.

311
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,259
[Beep]

312
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,012
It's done.

313
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,515
Nyssa: Laurel.

314
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,850
I just found out that
Malcolm Merlyn isn't only alive,

315
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,103
but that he killed my sister.
I'm sure you can understand

316
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,771
why I don't want
to talk right now.

317
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:07,128
I understand.

318
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,097
I loved her, too.

319
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:16,054
Sorry for your loss.

320
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,473
I promise Sara,

321
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,942
and I promise you--

322
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:23,394
we will find
Malcolm Merlyn.

323
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:27,148
Apparently you already did.

324
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,317
And Oliver should have
killed him.

325
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,701
Yes.

326
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:37,492

00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:30,913
She needed to be someplace else.

489

Ah. She doesn't like me.

You're wrong.
She hates you.

She's not happy
that I'm here.

Neither am I.

493
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,544
I killed a man today.

I don't even know the reason.

Sometimes it's
better that way.

What, blindly
following orders is better?

I'm not blind, Oliver.
I'm focused--

498
00:25:56,364 --> 00:25:58,314
on what's most
important.

499
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:00,233
You should do the same.

500
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:01,484
It's not our place
or our burden

501
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,453
to know why we carry out
our missions.

502
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:06,456
I didn't realize having a conscience
was a burden.

Oh, yeah? Do you mind if I try?

I want to work
on my Cantonese.

let you use my computer.

a deal, then?

Fine, five.
Give me the computer.

521

I need a meet
with Waller.

How did you--Akio!

It's not his fault. I need a meet.
Make it happen.

524
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:08,384
Waller's going
to want a reason.

Thanks for your help.

528
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:17,110
I mean, you really
didn't have to do all that.

529
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:18,444
I like painting.

It actually helps me
turn my brain off.

Feels kind of zen.

You know, I actually wish you were
still trying to get into my pants,

because this whole
zen helpful Roy thing

is really freaking me out.

535

Get away from him.

536
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:43,720
I'm not here
for him.

Thea, are you here?

[Sighs]

541
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:21,840
So Malcolm Merlyn is alive,
and Thea's father.

Anything else
you haven't told me?

543
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:24,428
What did you get
at the precinct?

544
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:25,929
Not much.

545
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:28,064
But I did get this
off a traffic camera.

546
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:30,400
It was recorded
10 minutes ago.

547
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:33,680
After I struck out on anything related
to Nyssa or Thea,

548
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:34,895
I just looked for strange.

549
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,265
Well, that
definitely counts.

550
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:39,900
Sara.

551
00:28:39,902 --> 00:28:42,320
She never said much
about the League.

552
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:44,611
But she did say that their communication
system was a little outdated.

Smoke signal.

554
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:47,302
Nyssa's sending
Malcolm a message.

555
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:48,804
I don't know about the cipher,
but I'm willing

556
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:50,522
to bet my wallet that means
"we got your daughter."

557
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:52,775
Doesn't matter.
Video gives me her location.

558
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,476
You mean "us"
on location, right?

559
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:55,727
No. I need you to secure
the perimeter.

560
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:56,779
Can't risk Thea
seeing you.

561
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,230
Copy that.

562
00:28:58,232 --> 00:29:01,066
She already knows
I know about the Arrow.

563
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:03,152
Not with a dose of League
tranquilizer in your system.

Oliver.
This is my fault.

565

I told Nyssa
to go after Merlyn.

566
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:10,492
I told her to do
whatever it takes.

to you or to Thea...

I'm going to get free of this,
and when I do, I'm going to kill you!

for involving you in this.

My quarrel
is with your father.

My father's been dead for years,
you crazy psycho bitch.

Your true father--

Known to the uninitiated
as Malcolm Merlyn.

Then you know what he's going to do to
you when he gets here.

580
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:56,222
I know he'll die.
My father taught me ways

581
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:57,973
to cut a man to make
his death last for days.

582

What he is capable of.

He will kill
without hesitation.

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,876
in order to buy
the time necessary

happened with Sara.

00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:58,856
Amanda: I hate Hong Kong.

660
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:01,025
And I hate
transpacific flights.

661
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:03,410
And do not even get me
started on the topic

662
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:06,113
of being summoned
by one of my operatives.

663
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:07,614
Ferris Air
flight 637.

Paris to Hong Kong
nonstop.

665
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:12,586
You prevented that flight from
being shot down over Lian Yu.

666
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:13,635
Were you watching me?!

Via Keyhole Hexagon satellite.

How else was I supposed
to know you possess

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,710
the capabilities I require?

670
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:22,679
That business
with the freighter last year...

671
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:24,848
Impressive.

the man
you had me murder.

676
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,307
He was Edward Fyers'
handler.

677
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:37,309
And he worked for you.

678
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:39,344
You're out of your depth,
Mr. Queen!

679
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,096
I don't think I am.
I think Mr. Castwidth

680
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,565
had a USB drive on him
detailing everything.

681
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:46,185
I think he knew that you told
Fyers to shoot the plane down.

682
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,020
And I think that
you wanted him silenced!

683
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,856
And the world thinks you dead,
Mr. Queen.

684
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:53,075
The convenient thing
about dead men

685
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:54,860
is that no one tends
to believe them.

686
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,995
Yeah, well, what about dead men who
make arrangements

687

to get the information
on that USB drive

in the hands of every blogger and
journalist in this hemisphere.

689

If anything happens
to Maseo's family,

690
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,078
then you're going
to spend a long time

testifying in front
of the senate sub-committee.

692
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:10,866
The world's a much more
complicated place

than you realize.

694
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:16,872
Edward Fyers thought
he was to shoot down that plane

695
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,541
to destabilize
the Chinese economy.

696
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:23,211
In truth, I wanted
to take out a single target.

697
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:25,964
So you blow up a plane
full of innocent people

Two years ago,
we had our only chance at her.

And you saved her life.
