1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,925
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,890
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,088
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,609
To save my city.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,923
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,204
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,887
I must be something else.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,285
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,171
Slade.

10
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,388
I need someone qualified
to fix this boat.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,767
I sure hope a Mr. Hendrick
is there with you.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,361
There's no way in hell
I'm going back there.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,329
Please, put the gun down.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,368
You cannot die until you have known
complete despair.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,167
And you will, I promise.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,367
Stay away from Thea.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,882
She's not
safe when she's around you.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,970
You love her, and that's why
you're gonna do what I'm asking.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,731
It's a dangerous city.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,249
Mr. Wilson?

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,365
Call me Slade.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,524
Your mascara is running.

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,370
Thank you.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,163
Are you all right?

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,563
I don't know.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,328
It's my boyfriend.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,608
Ex-boyfriend now.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,771
He just, completely out of nowhere,
decides to end things.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,571
Heartbreak is something
I know all too well.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,321
It's not an easy thing to recover from.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,242
And sometimes you never do.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,651
Um... We're not, uh...

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,643
This isn't my home.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,689
You're not going home, Thea.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,049
Get out.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,211
Get out!

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,091
Hello, Thea.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,044
It's a pleasure to meet you.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,405
About time.

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,485
You letting the bad guys stay alive this
year has filled the jails up to capacity.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,524
Yep.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,920
Ready?

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,284
Well, I've been working with Sara,
but I'm not exactly a natural.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,805
Neither was I.

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,161
Okay, we have some work to do.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,004
Sorry. I'm just having a hard time keeping
my head in the game today.

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,003
- Thea?
- I just can't stop thinking...

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,050
what's the worst that could happen
if I just told her the truth.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,846
Well, I told a guy the truth
and he got struck by lightning.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,244
To be fair,
probably won't happen again, statistically.

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,527
Telling Thea the truth won't make
her safer, just the opposite.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,650
What we're doing, Roy, it's dangerous.

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,010
And anyone that is even in our orbit
can get hurt.

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,331
Try again.

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,130
This time...

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,485
aim.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,922
What are those?

58
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:33,350
Better month's worth of phone
messages from Queen Consolidated.

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,063
Toss them.

60
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,194
That's what I did with
last month's messages.

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,204
With Slade out there,
I don't have time for the company.

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,529
Well, you have to make time, Oliver,
at least three hours.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,284
- The annual board meeting.
- Ugh.

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,649
There's absolutely zero way that the CEO
can avoid being there.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,283
And I know it's been a while,
so in case you've forgotten, that's you.

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,323
Do you remember
where you put your business suit?

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,802
Or do you keep it in a cool glass case too?

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm gonna kill all of you.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,525
This is not personal.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,082
Well, maybe a little.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,891
It's not. This is about survival.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,930
"Survival." What a noble word for murder.

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,689
Slade gave us no option.

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,689
Hendrick for Oliver.

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,731
And what gives any of us the right to decide
one's life is more valuable than another?

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,406
He is tied up. We are not.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,689
Once he gets the boat working,
Slade will have no more need for him.

78
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,527
So let's not kid ourselves. Doing this is
effectively sentencing Hendrick to death.

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,884
He would do the same thing to any of us
in heartbeat.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,526
This is only option.

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,930
What if it's also an opportunity?

82
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,927
To do what?

83
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,006
Well, to kill Slade.

84
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,982
I know that I haven't
been here in a while,

85
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,433
but you don't look like the
entire board of directors.

86
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,006
The meeting doesn't start
for another half-hour.

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,651
Really?

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,566
I routinely bump all appointments 30
minutes in anticipation of you being late.

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,085
That's good policy.

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,086
But thank you for coming out of hibernation
for this.

91
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,210
Whether you recognize it or not,
it's your name on the building.

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,203
No matter how many meetings you miss...

93
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,505
you're still the public
face of this company.

94
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,673
Isabel, I realize I
have been distracted.

95
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,604
Thank you for picking up the slack.

96
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,689
Ours is an unconventional partnership,
but it's a partnership.

97
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,921
And it's working.

98
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,326
Indeed, it is.

99
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,130
Oliver?

100
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,641
Your mother's here.

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,361
Family squabble?

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,082
And how is Miss Rochev these days?

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,164
Still angry that Dorothy dropped a house
on her sister?

104
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,841
- Have you heard from Thea?
- No.

106
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,135
You haven't returned
any of my phone calls,

107
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,269
so I'm left to resort to
checking in person...

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,006
as to whether you're attending
the debate tonight.

109
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,209
I told you that I would publicly support
your campaign.

110
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,881
Anything else?

111
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,561
It would be embarrassing
for us both if you

112
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:23,065
couldn't at least appear
to be my son tonight.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,841
I have gotten pretty good at pretending
to be someone I'm not.

114
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,810
I learned it from you.

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,249
Excuse me. Have you seen Thea Queen?

116
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,284
Okay.

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,165
Speedy, it's Ollie. And I'm at the debate,
where I thought you would be.

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,847
Listen, I know that you're upset about Roy,
but Mom needs both of us here...

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,082
so please just call me back.

120
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,891
You do not look happy.
Is everything all right?

121
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,001
Yes, my sister's just a little late.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,684
I'm afraid that's my fault.

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,282
SCPD insisted that I arrive with a
motorcade. We tied up traffic all over the city.

124
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,809
I'm sure Thea's probably just fallen victim
to gridlock.

125
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,883
Well, I should probably try her again.

126
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,411
Good luck tonight, Sebastian.

127
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,129
Thank you, sir.

128
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,524
I thought backstage was supposed to be
restricted access.

129
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,564
The benefits of having
a district attorney's badge, I guess.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,481
- You stopped by to wish Moira good luck?
- I did.

131
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,160
But I'm really glad I ran into you.

132
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,130
I owe you an apology.

133
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,760
I accused you of really terrible things.

134
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,489
You were going through a very difficult
time. I'm just happy you're on the mend.

135
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,405
Good luck tonight.

136
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,244
I'm not the one who's gonna need it.

137
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,684
Sebastian Blood is not the man
you think he is.

138
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,605
He's not going to revive this city
with social services.

139
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,604
He's going to bankrupt it
with unfunded mandates.

140
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,765
Mrs. Queen's problem with my proposals is
that they will be paid for by the 1 percent.

141
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,043
It's time the wealthiest people
stop avoiding their responsibility.

142
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,244
It will limit their
abilities to hire people.

143
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,512
All right, that's time.

144
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,928
And I will remind the candidates
to please refrain from interrupting.

145
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,004
Now we have the next
in our series of video

146
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,995
questions submitted by
Starling City voters.

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,281
This one comes from...

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,047
"Thea Queen"?

149
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,090
Okay, there must be some mistake.

150
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,731
Help. Help.

151
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,645
Somebody help me, please.

152
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,769
He's...

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,167
Oh, my God.

154
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,488
We're gonna find her, Roy.
We're gonna get her back.

155
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
She's a tough girl.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,766
Is she gonna be alive when we find her?

157
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,050
You can't think like that.

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,484
I can't stop thinking like that.

159
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,122
- There he is.
- Mr. Diggle.

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,401
Mr. Diggle. Sir, can we get a comment?

161
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,210
I think I might have found
something, I'm working on it...

162
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,545
I am suspending my campaign...

163
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,082
and devoting its resources
to the safe return of Thea Queen.

164
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,607
The video referenced a demand
but no ransom...

165
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,525
which means
this might not be about money.

166
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,651
We're gonna get her back, Moira.
I promise you. Thea's coming home.

167
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,764
Can you think of anyone who might wanna
get to you through Thea?

168
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,802
No one. Except for the families
of the 503 people that died last year.

169
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,645
This isn't about the quake.

170
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,851
How can you be so sure?

171
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:52,067
You just need to find
the man in the mask.

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,043
Look, we're working on it.

173
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,727
- We're running down every lead.
- What are those leads?

174
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,124
Oh, God. Oh, God,
how could I have let this happen?

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,604
Excuse me for a minute.

176
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,523
If I hear about one more invasive press
inquiry being sent to Mr. Queen...

177
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,002
or to any member of the Queen family,
I will hold you personally responsible.

178
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,567
You're very scary. Thank you.

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,931
My job's to take things off your plate,
now more than ever.

180
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,926
To that end, you remember how at today's
meeting the board nominated new officers?

181
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,971
Voting has to take place within 24 hours.
It cannot be suspended. It's an SEC thing.

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,830
- I can't think about this right now.
- I know and I'm sorry. But you have to.

183
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,665
You're the CEO. You
have responsibilities.

184
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,471
Which you handle
for me all the time.

185
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,766
A board vote is several orders of magnitude
different from covering a missed meeting.

186
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,571
You could appoint someone CEO pro tern.

187
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,166
- That's not a good idea.
- I'm appointing you.

188
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,924
What?

189
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,131
Congratulations, you are the temporary CEO.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,047
I can't.

191
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,687
Please.

192
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,249
Thank you.

193
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,171
Have Thea thank me
when she's back safe at home.

194
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,965
Mr. Queen? I need to talk to you.
It's about Mr. Wilson.

195
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,442
Since the last place Thea was seen was
Verdant, I used credit-card receipts...

196
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,061
compiled a list of
customers last night,

197
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,310
pinged all their cell phones
and hacked into their photos.

198
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,064
The NSA's right. It's
a lot easier when you

199
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,951
don't need a warrant. I
eyeballed every photo.

200
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,287
- Must've been thousands.
- It's Thea.

201
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,125
I found this.
Partial plate three blocks from the club.

202
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,648
Car is registered to a Slade Wilson,
and it has GPS.

203
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,325
Where is it right now?

204
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,165
Parked outside a defunct bar on Roosevelt.

205
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,084
Okay, this doesn't seem easy to you?

206
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,164
Slade using a car registered in his name?
The whole thing smells rotten.

207
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,164
Either Thea's there, or he is.
Either way, we have to go.

208
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,130
I figured you'd say that,
which is why I worked up these.

209
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,568
Tibetan pit-viper venom.
The League of Assassins' poison of choice.

210
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,001
And the most powerful sedative
that I've ever worked with.

211
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,180
That'll give us an advantage.
You are gonna give us another.

212
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,560
- You sure you want me to go?
- Are you angry?

213
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,450
Use that rage.

214
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,650
Well, you're just always
telling me to hold back.

215
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Not tonight.

216
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,161
Landmines?

217
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,085
What kind of island is this?

218
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,481
Can you remove the explosive?

219
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,324
Certainly.

220
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,290
Without it going off? Eh.

221
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,329
Less certain.

222
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,403
Ah, KGB...

223
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,962
you taught me many, many things.

224
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,401
Russian bomb...

225
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,842
Japanese bomb...

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,846
they both go boom.

227
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,448
Congratulations, we are not dead.

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,047
Now what?

229
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,205
Well, Slade takes Hendrick as we agreed.
And then once they're far enough away...

230
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,691
What?

231
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,047
You want to rig Hendrick into bomb?

232
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,687
Peter was right. Handing Hendrick over
to Slade is the same thing as killing him.

233
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,286
And you're right too,
we don't have a choice.

234
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,048
At least this way, he can take out Slade,
and then we can take the ship.

235
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,922
- What?
- Just wondering...

236
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,367
When did you become so scary?

237
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,523
Where is she, Slade?

238
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,205
The man asked you a question.

239
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,491
Where is she?

240
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,249
What are you gonna do, kid? Kill me?

241
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,685
But then who would tell you...

242
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,969
where your beloved Thea is?

243
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,444
Call Detective Lance.

244
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,329
- Tell him to come down here.
- What? Why?

245
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,289
To arrest Slade Wilson.

246
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,126
Any idea what this son of a bitch
wants with Thea Queen?

247
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,602
No. We just need to make sure that
Slade gives up where he's holding her.

248
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,767
Does Oliver know?

249
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,384
That you're working
with the Arrow on this.

250
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:42,708
Oliver doesn't know
anything about the Arrow.

251
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,490
Are you okay?

252
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,927
Yeah. It's just that look in Moira's eyes.

253
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,487
Terrified she's lost her daughter.

254
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,967
I couldn't go through that again, Sara.

255
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,126
Yeah.

256
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,290
Officer Lance? The Queen family's here.

257
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,889
- Mr. Lance, did he tell you where Thea is?
- Mrs. Queen, thank you for coming.

258
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,203
This doesn't make any sense.
Slade Wilson is a friend.

259
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,806
And he's been in Costa Rica
for the past 72 hours.

260
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,922
He can provide flight manifests,
phone records, even some videos...

261
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,082
so he couldn't have taken your daughter.

262
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,231
If he didn't, then why
did you arrest him?

263
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:21,956
We didn't.

264
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,923
He was apprehended by the vigilante...

265
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,449
who then contacted Officer Lance.

266
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,524
- Lieutenant, I can explain...
- No, I think I got a pretty clear picture.

267
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,082
God, you're a special kind of stupid. The
whole reason you're wearing that uniform...

268
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,523
instead of a detective's shield is because
you were working with the vigilante.

269
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,650
- A young girl's missing...
- Now you arrest someone on his say-so?

270
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,771
You'll be lucky if the next uniform
that puts you in isn't prison gray.

271
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,483
They're calling you Deathstroke.

272
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,887
It's a bit flamboyant. Heh.

273
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,601
I like it.

274
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,765
How'd you get off the island?

275
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,888
That is your first question?

276
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,805
Well, you've made it pretty
clear that you're not

277
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,066
gonna tell me where my
sister is, so yeah...

278
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,009
that's my first question.

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,206
I swam.

280
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,524
But it wasn't without its obstacles.

281
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,728
The rip current dragged me under.

282
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,441
The rocks and reef cut up my flesh
to the bone.

283
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,769
But the Mirakuru...

284
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,124
it regenerated everything.

285
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,363
Except this.

286
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,930
You know, it's just the
two of us in here...

287
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,004
so why don't we try being honest.

288
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,760
Why are you doing this?

289
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,724
You know why.

290
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,687
It was five years ago.

291
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,001
It was yesterday.

292
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,124
Oh, I tried to let go of the island...

293
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,402
but it's still got a hold on me.

294
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,247
And if that hood that you wear every night
is any indication...

295
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,763
it's still got a hold of you, kid.

296
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,449
She never did anything to you. I did.

297
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,728
Shado is dead
because of a choice that I made.

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,362
So punish me, blame me, but...

299
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,324
Thea...

300
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,969
You want me to beg?

301
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,521
Is that what this is all about?
Because I'm begging.

302
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,607
You win.

303
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,088
Just please.

304
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,884
Please tell me where she is.

305
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,087
Hmm. That must've been hard for you to say.

306
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,603
Thea.

307
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,486
Well, Thea is...

308
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,608
Mr. Queen? Who the hell let you in here?

309
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:07,049
Mr. Wilson, you are free to go
with the department's deepest apologies.

310
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,645
There's no need, lieutenant.

311
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,805
An innocent girl's life hangs in the balance.
You need to follow every lead possible.

312
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,090
Still, you should know that Officer Lance
is facing some very serious charges.

313
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,806
Don't pursue them on my behalf.

314
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,450
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

315
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,250
Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson.
Are you involved with the case, Mr. Wilson?

316
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,412
I was in Costa Rica, but
returned to Starling City

317
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:33,906
as soon as I heard
the terrible news.

318
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,361
What did you tell them
about Thea Queen's disappearance?

319
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,764
I'm offering every resource at my disposal
plus a $5 million reward...

320
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,005
for any information
that leads to Thea Queen's captors.

321
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,729
This is Dig. I've got the follow.

322
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,530
Tracker on his car is active.

323
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,001
Roy, he's coming up on your position.

324
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,729
Got him. He's turning up Warner.

325
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,201
I see him. Heading north.

326
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,567
Damn it, I lost him.

327
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,723
It's all right. I still have eyes on him.

328
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,291
Sara, cut right onto Downey.

329
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,169
Got it.

330
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,442
Negative. Negative, it's not him.

331
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,250
What?

332
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,487
Oh, my God.

333
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,531
He's cloned the tracker signal.
Roy, you've gotta move.

334
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,008
Roy, you gotta pick him up on Fuller.

335
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,004
Roy, do you still have eyes on him?

336
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,561
Roy? Roy?

337
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,047
Leave us.

338
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,965
I'm sorry I was gone for so long.

339
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,121
Screw you.

340
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,926
I saw Oliver and your mother.

341
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,128
They're all quite worried about you.

342
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,686
If you hurt them, I swear I...

343
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,161
Please, go on.

344
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,765
Finish that sentence.

345
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,811
I'm curious to know what kind of threat
a 19-year-old girl can make.

346
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,050
What do you want with me?

347
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,843
Well, that, Thea...

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,889
is a very long story.

349
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,961
Looks like I've got time.

350
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,326
Not at all.

351
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,849
You're free to go.

352
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,564
What?

353
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,361
I had to make a point.

354
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,687
And I made it.

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,289
The door is unlocked,
so you can leave anytime you'd like.

356
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,482
Those guys who work for you
will shoot me the second I walk out.

357
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,165
No, they won't.

358
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,164
Their instructions were
to keep you here until I returned.

359
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,324
And I have. So...

360
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,887
you're free to go.

361
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,442
But if you do...

362
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,683
you may never know
about your brother's secret.

363
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,729
- What?
- Your brother has a secret, Thea.

364
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,282
Would you like to know what it is?

365
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,644
So...

366
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,929
what now?

367
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,524
Wait for Oliver. He'll figure
out what our next move will be.

368
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,349
Wait for him to
tell us, you mean.

369
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:53,948
We can't do anything without
King Queen's permission.

370
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,771
- You're out of line, Roy.
- Let's all just calm down here.

371
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,531
Slade outplayed us. It happens.

372
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,082
It only happened
because the police let Slade go.

373
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,971
After we turned him in,
because Oliver told us to.

374
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,203
- What were we supposed to do?
- You're Special Forces.

375
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,682
She's an international assassin.
You'd think between the three of us...

376
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,128
we could've gotten answers out of Slade
ourselves instead of turning him in.

377
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,520
Here's what's really sick.

378
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,127
We didn't even question him because
he said it was the right thing to do.

379
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,568
Just like he said that I needed to break up
with Thea one week after telling me...

380
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,882
- it wasn't safe to leave her alone.
- Wait.

381
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,447
You think it's Oliver's fault
that Slade took Thea?

382
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,001
I think it's his fault that
I wasn't there to stop Slade.

383
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,761
And I think you're just blaming Oliver
because you lost Slade.

384
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,969
Well, of course you'd take his side.
You're screwing him.

385
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,521
Could you guys give us a minute, please?

386
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,530
You remember how she loved to color?

387
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,950
Your father would buy her boxes
of crayons by the truckload.

388
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:08,714
She could never get enough.

389
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,371
She'd draw on the walls.

390
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,288
And I could never get angry
because it was just so adorable.

391
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,404
You should try to get some sleep.

392
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,840
Is my baby still alive?

393
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,650
What?

394
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,086
Is my baby still alive?

395
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,887
Yes.

396
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,889
I woke up every day for five years,
the mother who lost her son. I...

397
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,370
I can't...

398
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,001
I can't endure it again.

399
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,201
And now you hate me.

400
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,010
And you have every justification.

401
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,089
- Now is not the time.
- Yes, it is.

402
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,570
It is exactly the time.

403
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,051
I've told you that these lies
were to keep our family safe.

404
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,326
To keep us all together.

405
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,086
But that was the biggest lie of all.

406
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,405
And I told it to you, to Thea...

407
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,647
to myself.

408
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,403
Because I was too weak...

409
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,927
to face any kind of truth.

410
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,249
What's happening now isn't your fault.

411
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,243
From the moment your children are born...

412
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,166
you worry what the world
might do to them.

413
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,246
But you never stop to think
what you might do to them.

414
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,491
That we could be our own worst enemy.

415
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,690
Ollie.

416
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,486
What did you do to him?

417
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,802
Not enough.

418
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,331
And what did you do to him?

419
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,672
We just knocked him out.
It's better that way.

420
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:43,748
He wasn't exactly a fan
of the arrangement.

421
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,845
I'd imagine.

422
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,122
Hendrick's all yours.

423
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,483
I know.

424
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,205
Wait.

425
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,365
It's an incredible thing, this Mirakuru.

426
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,811
Not only does it gives you strength,
it also heightens all of your senses.

427
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,482
TNT has a particular smell.

428
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,683
How long before it goes off?

429
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,524
Ninety seconds?

430
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,091
Sixty seconds?

431
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,369
You're probably thinking that the
blast would kill me...

432
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,608
but I disagree.

433
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,921
Not that I could say the same for you lot.

434
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,250
I'm tempted to see this blow you to pieces.

435
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,761
But then again, maybe I'll just shoot you
the same way that he shot Shado.

436
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,486
No.

437
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,769
Slade.

438
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,885
Hey, where you going?

439
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,349
Sitting around here isn't
helping Thea, now is it?

440
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,592
Neither is you running
off half-cocked, Roy.

441
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,607
I know that you think
that this is the Mirakuru, but it's not.

442
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,367
I'm right, and you know that I am.
So you better get the hell out of my way.

443
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,409
Roy, just calm down.

444
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,883
- That's what Thea would want us to do.
- She's right, Roy.

445
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,565
Come on, let's throttle back...

446
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,607
Next one goes into your chest.

447
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,921
Let him go.

448
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,721
You'd honestly kill me because I dare
to criticize the almighty Oliver Queen?

449
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,366
No, I'd kill you
because you're hurting my friend.

450
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,567
Let him go.

451
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,728
Let him go!

452
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,649
- What the hell's going on down here?
- I'm done.

453
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,446
That's what's going on.

454
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,410
Thea, she's out there, hurt or worse,
because of one person.

455
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,324
And that is not Slade Wilson.

456
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,289
Roy.

457
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,290
I believed in you.

458
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,920
There's nothing left for me here.

459
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,726
Oh, my God. Oliver.

460
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,167
Now what?

461
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,969
Publicity has drafted
a rather compelling statement...

462
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,011
and I will be doing the talk-show rounds
to control the spin.

463
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,447
I'm sorry, Miss Rochev, but he was very...

464
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,161
insistent.

465
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,769
Can you give us the room, please?

466
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,610
- Isabel, what have you done?
- Me?

467
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,769
Very little.

468
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,965
You're the one who made this possible
when you made me CEO.

469
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,605
I know it was only temporary...

470
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,287
but it gave me the authority I needed
to call an emergency board meeting.

471
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,010
As of 30 minutes ago...

472
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,089
your company belongs to me.

473
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,050
The directors unanimously
made my appointment permanent.

474
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,688
I'd say they lost faith in your leadership,
but that would imply there was any.

475
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,481
Maybe you should've focused
a little less on your...

476
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,526
evening activities.

477
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,851
Slade.

478
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,890
You're working for him.

479
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,565
With.

480
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,811
He knew planting me in your family's business
would draw you back to Starling City.

481
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,689
Truth be told, I was skeptical, but...

482
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,250
Why are you doing this?

483
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,081
I think it's sad you don't know.

484
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,081
"The sins of the father
are the sins of the son."

485
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,569
You are gonna tell me where my sister is...

486
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,041
or I am going to kill you.

487
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,368
Where is she?

488
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,003
He's holding her at a storage depot
just outside the city limits.

489
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,531
Tosca Cartage.

490
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,045
How do I know you're not lying?

491
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,281
It's cute how you think this isn't all
playing out exactly how he wants it to.

492
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,804
And he wants you to come alone.

493
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,443
If he even smells your partners,
he will gut sweet little Thea like a trout.

494
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,006
It was a pleasure doing business with you,
Oliver.

495
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,530
- At least let us surround the perimeter.
- No, Isabel was very clear.

496
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,045
I come alone, or Thea dies.

497
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,362
Ollie, this is another
one of Slade's games.

498
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,921
- And unless...
- No, what I can't do, Sara, is nothing.

499
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,323
What would you do if it were Laurel
or your father or your mother?

500
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,324
I will not get dragged into the same debate
over and over again.

501
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,005
Go.

502
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,930
Go get Thea.

503
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,804
Stop Slade.

504
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,809
Do whatever it takes.

505
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,809
End this once and for all.

506
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,931
Stop. Stop.

507
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,443
Halloween was six months ago, ass-hat.

508
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,682
Now, get off the road or get put down.

509
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,450
You hear me?

510
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,569
I have a proposal for you men.

511
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,089
- Go.
- Oliver, are you okay?

512
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,244
- Yeah, I'm fine. But Thea's not here.
- You did it.

513
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,721
- Did what?
- Thea's fine. She's fine.

514
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,161
She walked into the precinct
five minutes ago.

515
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,006
Safe and sound.

516
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,489
Oliver, did you hear me?

517
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,900
Thea?

518
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,784
She's fine. No injuries.
He didn't touch her.

519
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,564
He wasn't there. He had a lot of
men, hired guns. But he wasn't there.

520
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:15,869
Because he was busy elsewhere.

521
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,571
Iron Heights reopened a wing
damaged in the quake.

522
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,530
There was a prisoner transfer.
Slade hijacked it.

523
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,123
- Soldiers for his army.
- Abducting Thea was all a diversion.

524
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,729
Oliver.

525
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,011
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, my baby.

526
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,206
Oh, my baby.

527
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,245
What?

528
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,041
He told me.

529
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,641
Mr. Wilson...

530
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,564
he told me your secret.

531
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,848
How you've been lying to me for years.

532
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,321
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?

533
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,482
I believed in you.

534
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,126
We were trying to keep you safe.

535
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,800
You have any idea who you sound like?

536
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,724
You sound like her.

537
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,449
Slade...

538
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,361
death is too good for them.

539
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,722
This island should be their punishment.

540
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,807
Death is too good for you.
This island should be your punishment.

541
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,883
Their prison for the rest of their days.

542
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,243
Your prison for the rest of your days.

543
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,324
Get him out of here.

544
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,005
Slade.

545
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,571
Get back.

546
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,484
I can help you.

547
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,569
You can live or you can die. You choose.

548
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,924
Would you like to send a message
to your family?

549
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,369
Because as soon as this boat is fixed,
I'm paying them a visit.

550
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,206
Hell of a night.

551
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,045
Quentin Lance,
master of the understatement.

552
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,725
A word, officer?

553
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,043
Hold on, sweetheart.

554
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,565
Yeah.

555
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,564
I've spoken to DA Spencer
about your situation.

556
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,324
She doesn't wanna press charges...

557
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,608
if you cooperate.

558
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,330
Tell us who the vigilante is.

559
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,967
Heh. I'd love to, but I don't know.

560
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,326
- Well, that's unfortunate.
- Yeah, it looks like.

561
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,204
Quentin Larry Lance...

562
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,489
you are under arrest for conspiracy
and aiding multiple felonies.

563
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,927
What? Are you out of your mind?

564
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,562
What are you doing? Wilson did it.
I collared the right guy. What are you...?

565
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,842
- Pike.
- You have the right to remain silent.

566
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,606
- What are you doing?
- You have the right to an attorney.

567
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,330
Dad?

568
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,046
Riding what pundits are calling
a "sympathy bump"

569
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,726
Moira Queen pulled far ahead
of Sebastian Blood...

570
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,009
in the latest polls conducted
in the last 24 hours by channel...

571
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,323
This whole thing just blew up in our face.

572
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,803
How the hell do I get elected now?

573
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,727
- I think you intended a different tone.
- You said I'd be mayor.

574
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,091
And you just delivered this election
for Moira Queen. And for what?

575
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,006
What is this obsession you have
with the Queen family?

576
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,123
- You haven't told him? Heh.
- Shh.

577
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,205
You promised me.

578
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,203
I promised you this city.

579
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,569
I promised you an army
with which to take it.

580
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,051
What is our status?

581
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,807
Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences
Division is now fully dedicated...

582
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,726
to replicating a serum
based on your blood sample.

583
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,605
You see?

584
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,606
Everything is proceeding as planned.

585
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,125
Where are you going now?

586
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,204
To service my obsession.

587
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,449
Oliver Queen needs one more distraction.

588
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,730
What are you two doing here?

589
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,281
Thought this is where you would go.

590
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,162
You're predictable. That, and you've
been sleeping on the cot at night.

591
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,684
What are you doing here?

592
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,444
Where else would we be?

593
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,924
Roy was right.

594
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,364
At every turn,
I have made the wrong decision.

595
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,721
With him. With...

596
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,969
the company.

597
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,601
And with Thea.

598
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,529
I was so focused
on what Slade might do to me...

599
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,322
that it never even occurred to me
what I could do to myself.

600
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,241
I am my own worst enemy.

601
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,687
That's Slade talking, Oliver.
Don't let him in your head.

602
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,049
I can't keep him out of my head, Diggle.
I can't...

603
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,329
- I can't stop him from doing anything.
- Yes, you can.

604
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,964
What makes you so sure?

605
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,929
Because you're not alone, man.

606
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,328
Now what, boss?

607
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,571
Now we fight back.

608
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,206
Police have issued a warrant
for Slade Wilson...

609
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,524
after Thea Queen named him as
the mastermind of her kidnapping yesterday.

610
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,208
This in the wake of Wilson's arrest
and subsequent release by the SCPD...

611
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,647
hours before Miss Queen was released.

612
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,401
In a statement to the press,
SCPD Lieutenant Franklin Pike...

613
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,885
reiterated his support for his department
despite what appears to be a serious blunder.

614
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,883
He went on to say the SCPD
is committed...

615
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,204
to making sure any arrest they make
is a legal one.

616
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,927
Don't worry.

617
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,530
I am not here to harm you.

618
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,920
Go to hell.

619
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,601
All in good time, I'm sure.

620
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,569
But before then...

621
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,362
I have come to Starling City
to see Oliver Queen suffer.

622
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,684
Oliver...? What? Why?

623
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,531
Because he's not the man you think he is.

624
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,364
And how would you know that?

625
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,161
Because I know Oliver Queen is...

626
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,165
the Arrow.
