160
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,928
He was.
Until a week ago.

161
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,097
And then the case
against him imploded.

162
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,233
By which I mean
every single witness

163
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,968
suffered some sort
of fatal accident.

164

Three guesses as to who the police
suspect in those cases.

00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:06,207
Jermaine Fisher and the guy who
got away last night.

166
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,009
Jose Anton.

167
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,911
So they kill witnesses
in order to get Brick out of prison,

168
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:12,247
and then shoot
a cop to do...what?

169

That's what
we have to find out.

I think four
days ago,

178
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,836
Oliver challenged
the world's

179

greatest assassin
to a duel.

180
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,040
He survived Lian Yu.

00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,743
And Hong Kong,
and god know what else.

182
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:46,014
He defeated Malcolm Merlyn
and Slade Wilson.

You have to believe in him.

Oh, I do believe
in him, Felicity.

It's just, I'm preparing myself
for the possibility

that things didn't
go Oliver's way.

You're more than

No mistakes, and the cops not

But if there's one thing Oliver
taught me--he taught us--

321
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,114
is that sometimes,
all you can do

322
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,782
is keep pushing
forward.

323
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,318
All right.

324
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,053
I've got the M.E.'s report.

325
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:22,122
Did they ID
the body?

326
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,890
Jose Anton.

327
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,393
Career criminal with ties
to Danny Brickwell.

328
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,595
I think Brick severed
those ties pretty thoroughly.

329
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,000
Is everything ok?

330
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,170
Where's Oliver?

331
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:40,774
He went to fight
the head

332
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:43,109
of the League of Assassins.
What?!

333
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,812
And we haven't heard from him
since he left.

334
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,948
There's something else--

335
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,684
Malcolm Merlyn stopped by
for a little chat.

336
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:53,353
He says Oliver's dead.

337
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,989
And you guys believe him?

338
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,557
Look, Laurel,
Merlyn said--

339
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,426
There isn't one thing
that Malcolm Merlyn can say

340
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,094
that any of us should believe.

341
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,430
This isn't the first time

342
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:06,032
that I've heard
that Oliver was dead.

343
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:08,468
He's been back before.

344
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,137
He'll be back again.

345
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,621
[Grunts]

346
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,532
[Beep]
I'm in.

348
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:36,723
Found it!

00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,958
Aah!

350
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:44,364
Hong Kong military?

351
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,701
Triad.

352
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,170
Chien Na Wei's men.

353
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:53,973
Any luck?

354
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:57,110
The number pattern is consistent with
cataloguing numerics.

355
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,812
What kind of catalog?

356
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,747
If I knew, I would be
telling you.

357
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:02,849
I'm sorry to interrupt.

358
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,385
We really need
to change the locks.

359
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,153
What
do you want?

360
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,756
The League conducts matter
of significance such as duels

361
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,425
on grounds sacred
to its beliefs.

362
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,028
I went there.

363
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,531
And found this.

364
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:26,206
It's Ra's' custom
to leave behind

365
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,408
the instrument
of death

366
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,044
as a memorial
to honor the fallen.

367
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:34,314
Merlyn, did you see...

368
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,382
Oliver's body?

369
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:38,251
It fell into
a ravine.

370
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:41,354
His remains were
unrecoverable, I'm afraid.

371
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:44,491
Then how do we know
that's Oliver's blood?

372
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,694
Because after I leave,
you'll test it.

373
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,163
And after you confirm that
it is his blood,

374
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,732
you'll exhaust yourself with
conspiracy theories

375
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:56,703
as to how I planted it
or how it's all a lie.

376
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,405
And after enough
time passes,

377
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:03,376
you'll be left with
one inescapable truth--

378
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,912
that Oliver Queen
is dead.

379
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:10,016
This is your fault.

380
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,719
Oliver went there
because of you--

381
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,587
because of what
you did to Thea.

382
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,456
You made her a target
for the League so he would have

383
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,726
to challenge Ra's
just to save her.

384
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:22,996
You killed him.

385
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,465
You are right.

386
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,568
And I will live
with that guilt

387
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,171
for the rest of my days.

388
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:34,107
I am truly sorry.

389
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,975
I can see how much
you loved him.

390
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,578
Save it, Merlyn.

391
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,414
You're enjoying this.

392
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,184
Miss Smoak
is correct.

393
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:47,086
I orchestrated
the matter

394
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,088
to eliminate
the death warrant

395
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,724
Ra's placed
on my head.

396
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,359
Oliver was that way.

397
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:56,296
His death
means my own.

398
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:58,865
Good.

What's that?

The blood analysis
on the scimitar.

402
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:52,951
It's Oliver's.

99.997% match.

If Merlyn's lying,
he's being thorough about it.

Away from them! Go!

415
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,131
You had him.
Why didn't you take the shot?

416
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,167
We need to get out of here.

417
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:17,302

You know, it's weird.

I don't think I've ever actually
seen you drink alone.

420
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:37,222
You ok?

421
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:38,924
Yeah.

422

I just got some bad news
about a friend.

out, actually.

like the right time.

Well, it depends.
What's the favor?

430
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,012
You and the Arrow, you're...

431
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,014
you're close, right?

432
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:04,649
I mean, that's you
I've been seeing on the news

Look, I haven't seen him,

00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:10,288
I haven't heard from him,

437
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,225
he's not answering
any of my phone calls.

438
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:15,360
I'm actually starting
to get really worried.

439
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:18,363
So...I thought
maybe the Arrow

440
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,699
could look for Oliver?

441
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:22,901
I just thought maybe
if you saw him,

442
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:24,669
you could ask.

443
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,976
Thank you.
You're the best.

444

Look, I-- I better go check
the stock room.

445
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,355
Thea just asked me
to talk to the Arrow

446
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:45,357
about finding Oliver.

447
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,858
And what'd you
tell her?

448
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,360
What else? I lied.

449
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:50,862
Oliver didn't want
Thea to know.

450
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:54,065
That was then.
But now, what's the point?

451
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,268
I keep asking myself
the same question, Roy.

452
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,870
Then why do you keep
going over the case evidence?

453
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:02,107
Because it helps me keep
my mind off of Oliver.

454
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:03,909
Doing this
without him

455
00:26:03,911 --> 00:26:06,278
while we're waiting for him
to come back is one thing,

456
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,914
but doing all this without him,
without him?

457
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,515
That's a whole
other situation.

458
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,050
What do you want me
to tell you, Roy?

459
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:13,819
I can only see one inch
in front of me

460
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:16,488
and this is the only thing
in front of me right now.

461
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:22,894
I keep looking
at this file, and...

462
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:25,464
Something about it
feels familiar.

463
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:29,167
Yeah. Felicity did say that Fisher
and Anton were connected with Brick.

464
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,803
No, it's more
than that.

465
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:38,043
I've seen this file
somewhere...

466
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:41,012
Else.

467
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:43,415
What are the chances
that's a coincidence?

468

Hey, there's only
way to find out.

doing?

646
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:10,506
We need to leave
Starling City and never return.

647
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:14,944
Thank you all
for coming.

648
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:16,645
But seeing
as I'm the reason

649
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,881
none of you are
sitting in a prison cell right now,

650
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:21,817
I figure it's the least
you can do.

651
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,488
I know I'm the guy that made all
the evidence against you go away,

652
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,524
but as you can see,

653
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:30,960
it didn't go too far.

654
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:35,631
You are all part
of my crew now.

655
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:38,033
And if any of you
have a problem with that,

656
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:41,370
I can send a gift wrapped
package to the D.A.

657
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:46,308
Together, not only will
we make a lot of money,

658
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,878
we will make history.

659
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,480
Together,

660
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:54,850
we are going to take
over the Glades.

661
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:01,190
You think Brick's crazy?

662
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:02,892
Take over a whole
section of town?

663
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:04,326
I know he's crazy.

664
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:06,395
I don't know what
he's got planned,

665
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,764
but whatever it is, I'm in.

666
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,900
[Alarm shrieking]

667
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:19,642
Who the hell are you?

668
00:40:19,644 --> 00:40:21,810
I'm the justice
you can't run from.

669
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:26,715
Well done, Mr. Queen.

670
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:31,654
I'm glad to know my investment in you
hasn't entirely been for naught.

671
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:34,590
Although I was
disappointed to read

672
00:40:34,592 --> 00:40:37,826
Agent Pierson's
after action report.

673
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:40,329
You let one of Chien Na Wei's
men get away.

674
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:42,431
I hesitated.
It was a mistake.

675
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:44,366
It really was.

676
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:47,369
Now we have no one
to interrogate.

677
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:51,273
You mean torture, right?

678
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:59,415
I saw you with that man.

679
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:02,151
You didn't
hesitate.

680
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:05,421
You chose
not to shoot him.

681
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:09,758
I put the GPS from the vial
in his pocket.

682
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,396
And now he is going to lead us
right to Tatsu.

683
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,632
You're going to get
her back, Maseo.

684
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:18,100
I promise.

685
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:21,103
Oliver...

686
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:23,372
What you've done,

687
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:26,675
I will be forever
in your debt.

688
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:36,051
[Gasping]

689
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:38,587
Don't move.

690
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:42,024
You'll pull out the sutures.

691
00:41:42,026 --> 00:41:43,559
Oliver.

692
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:45,761
Tatsu.

693
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,029
How...

694
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,465
Maseo: I asked her
to come here...

695
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,772
So she could
bring you back to life.

696
