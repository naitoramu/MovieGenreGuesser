MADRID
77 DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

3
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,333
He's here.

4
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,791
Come on! Come on! We're 15 minutes late.

5
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:41,875
Come on!

6
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,833
- Just a second! Only the brows.
- Please. There's no time.

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:47,833
Hey!

8
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,125
On the stage.

9
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:33,041
For the last two and a half years,
many of you have called me a hero.

10
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,208
- Hero!
- So brave!

11
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,500
No, you are wrong, I am no hero.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,208
I'm just an ordinary man
who was brave enough

13
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,500
to refuse to kneel before the terrorists.

14
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,291
That's why...
That's why I can be here today.

15
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,666
My dignity remains intact.

16
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,916
Meanwhile, those rats...

17
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,500
are still hiding in their holes.

18
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:03,416
GUNA YALA ISLANDS

19
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:28,250
Some people like those kidnappers.

20
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,166
- No way!
- Yes, believe me.

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,625
They find them funny.

22
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,166
And I keep wondering...
is a criminal funny?

23
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,583
- No!
- No!

24
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,833
Can a terrorist be considered a hero?

25
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,083
No!

26
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,000
How about the so-called
Professor Robin Hood?

27
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,208
- No!
- No! Helsinki...

28
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,833
the beast from the Balkans,

29
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:55,500
kept me suffering for 24 hrs
with an explosive to my chest.

30
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,500
Can he be anyone's idol?

31
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,041
- No!
- No!

32
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,375
I just hope...

33
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:05,916
he feels guilty for what he did,
every single minute of his pathetic life.

34
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:13,083
PAMPAS
ARGENTINA

35
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,125
I rushed the so-called Denver,

36
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,125
with just a a pair of blunt scissors.

37
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,000
He had an M16.

38
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,041
Suicidal?

39
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,625
Maybe, but as a result,
the first hostages could escape.

40
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,708
However, in exchange,
he took what I loved most.

41
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,041
Mónica Gaztambide.

42
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,291
- Forget her!
- My lover!

43
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,791
Yes, I've also made some mistakes.

44
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,375
I've also been one of the unfaithful.

45
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,791
One of the selfish and despicable.

46
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,833
As a result...

47
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,333
I lost everything.

48
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,250
Nowadays, every single morning,

49
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,916
I wake up and think
of whatever happened to my son.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,416
JAVA

51
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,625
Move over, you idiot!

52
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,416
Fuck you!
And your rotten bananas!

53
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,875
I love you!

54
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,500
Life...

55
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,958
Life is lost
if you don't make your mind up

56
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,000
and you let yourself go with the flow.

57
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:46,208
I was a hostage, but we have all
been hostages to something.

58
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:47,833
Yes!

59
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,166
To face that,

60
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,916
you need to make up your mind.

61
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,250
I make up my mind!

62
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,041
I face my problems! Repeat with me!

63
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,125
I make up my mind!

64
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,333
I face my problems!

65
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,958
I make up my mind! I face my problems!

66
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,958
<i>I make up my mind! I face my problems!</i>

67
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,291
<i>I make up my mind! I face my problems!</i>

<i>My name is Tokyo.</i>

71
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,666
<i>Remember me?</i>

72
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,416
<i>The Caribbean.</i>

73
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,666
<i>For over two years,
my life has been a romantic movie.</i>

74
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,375
<i>We fish our own food.</i>

75
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,875
<i>Naked, wild...</i>

76
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,750
<i>But with some luxury.</i>

77
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,166
<i>And all of this is about to get fucked</i>

78
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,708
<i>by one simple thought
that's about to enter my head.</i>

79
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,333
We've been here for more than two years.

80
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,291
Two years in paradise.

81
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,208
Paradise is wonderful
when your life is dull...

82
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,208
and full of traffic jams...

83
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,666
so you go there sometimes.

84
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,916
You need a change of scenery, don't you?

85
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,166
And I'm not a part of the plan...

86
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,625
am I?

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,666
We had a good run.

88
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,333
Rio...

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,208
I need to get out of here.

90
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,416
I need the hubbub.

91
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,666
I need people.

92
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,041
I need not to know where I'll be tomorrow.

93
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,083
I get it.

94
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,250
I'll also leave.

95
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,541
An adventure will do us both good.

96
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,375
It may be for a bit,
but I can't be sure.

97
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,666
Best to say it's forever.

98
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,041
In case we want to talk.

99
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,708
It's a satellite phone. I bought it
on the black market with Helsinki.

100
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,291
- Rio...
- It's unregistered.

101
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,833
Turn it on every three days, at 6:00 p.m.

102
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,625
If either of us needs to call,
turn it on for five minutes

103
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,416
then off again if there's no contact.

104
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,125
Okay?

105
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,458
My number is on the back.

106
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,708
011_8876__546E_32/47
I LOVE YOU

107
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,750
Come on...

108
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,583
It's going to get dark soon.

109
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Rock on.

110
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,583
Rock on.

111
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,375
<i>I can behave like a good girl
for a while.</i>

112
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,083
<i>But little by little,
my naughty side starts to come out</i>

113
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,458
<i>and eventually, it explodes.</i>

114
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,375
<i>And when I turn into a Sputnik,</i>

115
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,416
<i>three days fly by.</i>

116

PANAMA
74 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

Tokyo, pick up...

121
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,458
Shit, Tokyo, turn it on.

122
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,125
Shit!

123
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,250
<i>Rio's position traveled from

125

<i>Then from Europol to the National

126
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,333
Hello?

<i>Europol has located Aníbal Cortés

<i>Mine reached them even faster.</i>

133
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,333
Target is out of town.

Hey, Rio.

138
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,750
That's her.

139
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,791
Hey, Tokyo.

140
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,500
Confirmed. It's Tokyo.

141
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,875
Police is on the way.

142
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,250
Sorry about the delay.

<i>How are you?</i>

144
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,041

I can't stand the Gunas' food.</i>

For fuck's sake, I grew up eating
pizzas, burgers, fries, sausages...

149
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,875
That's what I want.
I don't want to be with these guys!

150
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,916
You can't even make them laugh!

151

<i>Police is entering

Come on, come on!

00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,625
I wanna party with you

154
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:14,083
and dance and get wasted
until our pupils look like a raccoon's.

155
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,916
<i>That's what I want, Tokyo, fuck!</i>

156
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,416
Even if it's just a date.

157
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,916
So you want a date?

158
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
Of course I want a date.

159
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,416
Then pick a city.

160
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,708
<i>And I'll be there.</i>

161

Rio de Janeiro.

00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,916
- Shit!
- What?

163
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,833
- Patrol boats.
- What?

164
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,000
Patrol boats!

165
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,250
Run, Tokyo! They found us.

166
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,875
We are about to reach the plaza.

167
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,541
Alpha team, through the alley.

168
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,041
Back! Surround the building!

169
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,750
A COP IS NOT A FRIEND!

170
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,750
Alpha team through the passage!

171
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,750
Don't stop! Come on!

172
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,875
<i>Eagle to Fox 1, we can't see the target.</i>

173
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,166
Clear. Moving forward.

174
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,000
Cubeta, go through the Bodegón Alley,

175
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,416
in La Corrala del Muerto.

176
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,416
Come on! Come on!

177
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,583
Cubeta, she's inside the courtyard.

178
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,958
We are surrounding her.

179
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,208
I got you, bitch!

180
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,625
Bravo 2 in position.

181
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,500
Bravo 1 in position.

182
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,750
- Ready.
- Go, go!

183
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,666
- Lower your guns!
- Lower your guns!

184
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,833
Easy. Lower your guns.

185
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,833
<i>Negative. It's not her.</i>

186
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,833
- Shit.
- Fuck.

187
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:56,958
Bitch.

188
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,916
That way!

189
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,958
Go, go, go!

190
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,083
Come on, go!

191
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,833
<i>Guilty.</i>

192
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,041
<i>Guilty.</i>

193
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,291
<i>That's how I felt</i>

194
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,541
<i>while thinking about
every happy moment.</i>

195
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,875
<i>I had shared with Rio...</i>

196
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,875
<i>since we got free.</i>

197
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,750
EDGE OF PORTUGAL'S TERRITORIAL WATERS
THREE YEARS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

198
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,541
Ladies and gentlemen,

199
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,916
200 nautical miles.

200
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,958
We just made it into international waters.

201
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,916
There you go!

202
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,916
Hell yeah!

203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,250
We're rich!

204
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,333
Rich!

205
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,666
Professor!

206
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,750
Come on!

207
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,916
Rich!

208
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,625
Finish the champagne.
We need new guidelines.

209
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,708
Professor...

210
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,250
Come on.

211
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,875
We have 10 million now.
Do you think we're going back to school?

212
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,875
We've managed to escape,
but now comes the most difficult part.

213
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,875
Staying alive.

214
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,166
Don't open them yet,
wait until you're on your own.

215
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,250
- What's this?
- Safe houses. Every couple has one.

216
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,208
So you and Helsinki
will stick together?

217
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,875
Of course.

218
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,958
Great.

219
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,625
You'll be under protection
and surveillance.

220
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,791
So, Interpol's reach will be very weak.

221
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,500
- Not now, Denver.
- I didn't do anything.

222
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,208
Open them when you're on your own.

223
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,666
I'm the only one who should know
your whereabouts at any given moment.

224
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,750
What are those numbers for?

225
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,250
Each number belongs to a continent.

226
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,041
A continent on which
you might find yourself in need of help.

227
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,833
Commit them to memory.

228
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Now.

229
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:23,333
COLOMBIA
72 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

230
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,083
<i>These are phone numbers.</i>

231
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,250
<i>In an emergency, call the number
that corresponds with your location</i>

232
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,125
<i>to speak with your handler.</i>

233
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,583
The handlers are sleeper cells
that will bring you to me

234
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,750
safely.

235
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,833
<i>Hello?</i>

236
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,625
My name is Tokyo,

237
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,666
and I'm looking for my handler.

238
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,958
Not joining them?

239
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,958
In a moment.

240
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,166
What about you?

241
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,875
What about me?

242
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,000
Where are you going?

243
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,166
I hope you won't ever need
to find out, Miss Tokyo.

244
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,041
<i>But that day came.</i>

245
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,041
THAILAND
62 DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

246
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,500
<i>I imagine the same happens
in every paradise.</i>

247
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,875
<i>In the end, someone bites the apple</i>

248
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,125
<i>and everything goes to shit.</i>

249
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,583
Let's go.

250
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,333
Go in. They'll come for you.

251
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,041
<i>It took me 11 days to reach the temple
where my handler left me.</i>

252
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:12,708
<i>After an oil tanker, two cargo planes
and who knows how many buses...</i>

253
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,916
Miss Tokyo.

254
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,041
<i>...my guardian angel appeared.</i>

255
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,125
Welcome to Thailand.

256
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,583
Hello.

257
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't think I've ever been so happy
to see somebody.

258
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,708
Professor...

259
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,250
Have you heard from Rio?

260
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,333
Mom!

261
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:36,791
Mom!

262
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,500
PALAWAN
62 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

263
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:41,416
Mom! Mom, are you okay?

264
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,583
Are you okay?

265
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Are you cold?

266
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,500
Let's get out of the water.

267
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,500
Come on.

268
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,333
Yes, yes...

269
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,166
What happened, Mom?

270
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,458
It's okay, darling. Grandma was just...

271
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,500
My mom was fully dressed
in the water again.

272
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,208
The water felt so good...

273
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,875
Raquel.

274
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,916
How did your trip go, darling?

275
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,708
Pack your bags.

276
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,666
What's going on?

277
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,083
Tokyo's here.

278
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,083
Raquel, Raquel...

279
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,458
Until we know for sure what's happened,

280
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,125
you must take your mother
and your daughter to Mindanao.

281
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,708
And even though this place isn't safe,
you're going to stay.

282
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,625
It's for the best.

283
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,916
Because you have to fix a problem
for Tokyo.

284
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,875
On your own.

285
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,875
If you are thinking of hiding me
so she won't see me,

286
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,625
you'd better think again.

287
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,184
- What's that bitch doing here?
- Calm down. She's one of us now.

288
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,916
Put it this way. I changed sides.

289
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,958
You know who changes sides during a war?

290
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,750
- Traitors.
- Tokyo...

291
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,500
- The lowest of the low.
- Tokyo!

292
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,791
You know what happens with those rats?

293
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,041
They can change sides once, twice,

294
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,875
a hundred million times.

295
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,958
- Tokyo, please...
- She'll betray you!

296
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,833
She'll betray you as she betrayed them.

297
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,208
- That won't happen.
- Why not?

298
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,250
How can you know? Tell me!

299
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,250
- I know.
- Really?

300
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,708
- And I'm absolutely sure.
- Sure?

301
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:09,791
Down in your pants?

302
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,416
If the Professor tells you I'm one of you,
then I'm one of you.

303
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,125
Is that clear?

304
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,166
Nice smack you delivered.

305
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,125
We're not going to get along like that,
Inspector

306
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:27,625
Lisbon.

307
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,583
My name is Lisbon.

308
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:37,708
Well, afterrthis touching reunion,

309
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,833
let's go have some tea.

310
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,666
Please.

311
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:49,916
- Hands up!
- Get down!

312
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,125
I told you to get down!

313
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,583
Hands behind your back!

314
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:54,875
Don't move!

315
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,916
How long ago was that?

316
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Eleven days.

317
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,833
Where did you get the satellite phones?

318
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,166
When we split into two ships,

319
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,291
we were in port in Casablanca
for 24 hours.

320
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,291
He bought them on the black market.

321
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,708
From a Libyan.

322
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,541
In Casablanca...

323
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,833
They were unregistered.

324
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,500
Of course they were.

325
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,041
Not only that...

326
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,833
The vendor sold us out

327
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,375
for the reward money.

328
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,125
Professor...

329
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,750
Are you completely sure Rio's been caught?

330
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,750
He'd have rung his handler like you.
Don't you think?

331
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,791
But nothing's been published.

332
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,333
He was arrested 11 days ago.

333
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,250
It's the best news
the government can announce.

334
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,333
Why would they keep it secret?
It's a bombshell.

335
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,750
How long can they keep him hidden?

336
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,333
Seventy-two hours.

337
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,708
Where's he being held?

338
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,731
They're not torturing him, are they?

339
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,291
I don't know, Tokyo. I don't know.

340
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,916
Of course he's being tortured.

341
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,916
In any democratic country,

342
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,166
there's a backyard for playing dirty
in case things turn nasty.

343
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,541
And we've made things very nasty for them.

344
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,500
Well, you did.

345
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,041
They can't torture him.

346
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,416
It's the 21st century.

347
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,541
Sure they can.

348
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:46,291
At a height of 35,000 feet,
above any jurisdiction,

349
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:50,208
on the CIA flights or in Guantanamo.

350
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,958
Even Spain had terrorist commandoes.

351
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,361
Are you fucking kidding me, Tokyo?
Were you born yesterday?

352
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,458
Professor.

353
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,708
We need to get Rio out.

354
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,000
Are you listening?

355
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,458
We need to rescue Rio.

356
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,291
Did you buy any more phones?

357
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,375
Yes. Helsinki.

358
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,208
We have to gather everyone.

359
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,791
Professor!

360
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,083
Professor!

361
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,750
Tell me you're going to save Rio.

362
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,458
How, Tokyo?

363
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:48,666
We don't even know what country,
prison or goddamn hole he is in.

364
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,125
We know nothing.

365
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,458
Nothing.

366
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,375
Professor!

367
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,041
Professor!

368
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,791
I'm so happy to see you.

369
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,708
So happy.

370
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,833
- Miss Gaztambide.
- You can say "Mrs"! We got married!

371
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,750
Balinese rites,
an elephant and everything.

372
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,666
Tokyo!

373
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,000
Tokyo!

374
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,916
Tokyo! Tokyo!

375
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,416
Do you want to come with me?

376
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,583
Professor!

377
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:24,291
Professor!

378
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,416
Slow down, Helsinki!

379
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,958
Slow down, this is not funny!

380
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,041
Helsinki!

381
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,458
Asshole!

382
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,250
My dress!

383
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,125
What's up?

384
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,250
Nobody is going to hug me or what?

385
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,791
Let's toast in silence.
Don't wake the boy up.

386
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,583
Say it with an Argentinian accent.

387
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,833
Hey, <i>boludo.</i>
Listen to me, congratulations.

388
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,083
The worst Argentinian accent
I've ever heard. For real.

389
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,833
- Your house is so beautiful.
- It feels like heaven in here.

390
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,166
- Where's Rio?
- He knows.

391
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Rio isn't coming.

392
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,958
He's been arrested.

393
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,375
When was that?

394
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,583
Seventeen days ago on a Caribbean island.

395
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,416
It hasn't made the papers.

396
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,375
He's in some shithole, being tortured.

397
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
How did they find him?

398
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,625
He used a satellite phone.

399
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,708
Was he in danger?

400
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
No.

401
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,666
There were rules.

402
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,291
No Europe.

403
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,875
No phones.

404
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,875
What the fuck are we doing here?

405
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,166
For safety reasons.

406
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,833
Safety reasons, what safety reasons?

407
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,583
Rio didn't know where we were.

408
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:13,750
Guys...

409
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:16,416
We must help him.

410
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:20,500
Let's see...
What the fuck are we doing here?

411
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,791
Do you really think
we're going to rescue Rio?

412
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,875
Yes, Denver.

413
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,703
That's exactly what I think.

414
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,291
Jesus Christ...

415
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,250
You made me cross the world
with a small baby to tell me that shit?

416
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,166
Are you smoking opium
in Asia, Professor?

417
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,333
Please, sit down.

418
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,166
This isn't a fucking video game.
You're not my boss.

419
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,250
Sit down.

420
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,500
You owe me your fucking life!

421
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,250
Do you understand that?

422
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:58,041
You owe me all this. That fucking backyard
and even that fucking sea

423
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:01,458
because you can't bring my dad back.
Got it?

424
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,250
Listen, I have a son.

425
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:09,083
I fucking swear I won't let him suffer
as much as I did.

426
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,791
Ask him yourself

427
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,208
if he wants his daddy to get riddled
with bullets.

428
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,291
Denver.

429
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,750
He's being plunged into a bathtub,
with a bag around his head.

430
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,666
- Do you understand?
- Sorry but that's his fucking problem.

431
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,875
That face...

432
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,083
you're looking at

433
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,833
is the same face
your dad was looking at

434
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,750
while you were trying
to dig the tunnel.

435
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,458
She didn't leave his side,
not for a second.

436
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,250
Tokyo was there.

437
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,041
Rio made a mistake.

438
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,000
But you also made some mistakes.

439
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:55,666
You dragged your dad to the rooftop.
You two could have been killed.

440
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,250
But the gang was there.

441
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,833
Helsinki, you took the car
to the scrapyard, but didn't crush it.

442
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,125
We fixed it.

443
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,166
The gang was there.

444
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,333
You stopped the machines late,

445
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,541
Nairobi.

446
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,250
And the police came in.

447
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,833
And you could escape through the tunnel
because Berlin...

448
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,416
stayed to hold them back.

449
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,833
He gave us the seconds we needed.

450
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,500
The gang was there.

451
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,000
The one not here now...

452
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,583
is Berlin.

453
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,541
Neither is Oslo.

454
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,625
Nor Moscow.

455
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,166
No way...

456
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,416
She's one of us.

457
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,500
I made a mistake.

458
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,166
I lost control.

459
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,833
But the gang was there.

460
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:32,208
Now Rio has made a mistake,
like we all have.

461
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:37,458
I can't ask you
to feel what I feel, but...

462
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,333
I feel truly responsible

463
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,750
that some... son of a bitch...

464
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,916
is giving him electric shocks
while he hangs from his ankles.

465
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,250
I'll go!

466
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,375
You're not going, Nairobi.

467
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,791
Because if you're going, I'm going too.

468
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,458
Here we go again.

469
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,166
How are we going to rescue Rio?

470
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,458
With a robbery. That's what we're good at.

471
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,208
A robbery? That's how we'll rescue him?

472
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,541
It will begin with...

473
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,250
a robbery.

474
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,333
But...

475
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,666
But we're really going to defy the system.

476
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:15,625
This time we won't be those guys
who kidnap people to make their own money.

477
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,500
We'll be the guys who take a stand.

478
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,666
The guys who say, "Enough is enough."

479
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,541
What they're doing to Rio
is a declaration of war.

480
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,916
And we are the resistance.

481
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,791
Right?

482
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,000
What are we going to rob?

483
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,875
The gold.

484
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:39,958
Gold?

485
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,250
Not just gold.

486
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,416
<i>The </i>gold.

487
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,458
The only gold that matters.

488
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,250
The national reserve of the Bank of Spain.

489
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,625
That's a big one, isn't it?

490
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,333
Never bigger.

491
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,083
And that idea just came to you now,
looking at the sunrise?

492
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,458
No, it's not my plan.

493
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,083
Your father's?

494
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,041
No. It's not my father's.

495
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:25,583
FLORENCE
5 YEARS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

496
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,083
Andrés.

497
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,541
Little brother.

498
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,666
Welcome to Italy.

499
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,416
A country with art, class...

500
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,375
where people are stylishly dressed.
Unlike you.

501
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,166
You look like a traveling salesman.

502
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:14,875
Follow me.

503
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,041
I'm taking you to my humble abode.

504
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,833
I've got so much to tell you.

505
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,625
This is "the humble abode
in the country" you were going to rent?

506
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,583
You begin a search for a house
with two bathrooms and a garden,

507
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,250
and end up renovating a monastery.

508
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,791
I know how to break into the Royal Mint.

509
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,250
Through the door?

510
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,250
The back door. On the truck
with the with the spools of paper.

511
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,208
Andrés, there's people here.

512
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:04,208
Don't worry, we don't cross paths.
They're the perfect neighbors.

513
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,583
- They're monks!
- Cistercians.

514
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,375
They live in one wing,
we're in the other.

515
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:10,750
Besides, they swore a vow of silence.

516
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,208
They swore to remain silent.

517
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,625
Not before a gun, or a judge,

518
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,458
but before God Almighty.

519
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,958
Much more interesting, isn't it?

520
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,541
And...

521
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,958
what did you tell them?

522
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,250
That I'm an intellectual
in need of austerity and solitude

523
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,916
so I can write a treaty
on theological philosophy.

524
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,125
Did they believe you?

525
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,916
I also paid for the refurbishment

526
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
so they didn't have to turn this beauty
into a hotel.

527
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,458
They don't need anything else.
They adore me.

528
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,750
Sometimes I even sing
Gregorian chants with them.

529
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,208
Watch your head.

530
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,583
Andrés, do you sleep in a cell?

531
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,708
I intended to. But I fell in love...

532
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,083
with this chapel.

533
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,541
It's wonderful, isn't it?

534
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:32,291
Sergio, my dearest friend.
Long time no see. Come here.

535
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,375
What's all this?

536
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:37,541
Do you remember the plan to rob the gold
from the Bank of Spain?

537
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:41,750
It's amazing. We can obtain
up to 90 tonnes of gold from there.

538
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,625
We found the answer.

539
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,125
And I think you'll love it.

540
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:49,583
It's the most intelligent piece of civil
engineering since the Panama Canal...

541
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,041
Wait a minute.

542
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:54,458
I've told you a million times:
you may get the gold, but, Andrés,

543
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,875
there's no way
you'll leave the Bank of Spain alive.

544
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,500
Those are just insignificant details.
The gold comes first.

545
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,333
We'll deal with
the people after, okay?

546
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:07,041
- What do you mean "insignificant details"?
- Let's think about it later.

547
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,583
Don't you think
I look a bit different?

548
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,083
- Well...
- I have to tell you about a woman.

549
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:15,916
Look at this...

550
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:17,583
little cutie.

551
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,041
Let me introduce you to Tatiana.

552
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,458
Yes, she's really pretty.

553
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,250
She's madly in love.

554
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,583
A goddess.

555
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,875
<i>The Professor never imagined</i>

556
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,291
<i>that one day</i>

557
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,291
<i>he would have to make
that suicidal plan his own.</i>

558
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,458
WELCOME

559
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,125
BACK

560
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,500
Okay. Most of you know the rules,

561
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:59,333
but since there are some new faces,
we'd better review them.

562
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,333
First of all, no personal relationships.

563
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,458
Well, that rule's been...

564
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:12,458
The second rule is:
no first or last names.

565
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,625
Professor.

566
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:18,208
Let's get down to business. How are we
going to break into the Bank of Spain?

567
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,208
By making a racket.

568
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,833
MADRID
D-DAY

569
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,291
<i>Nowadays,</i>

570
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,958
<i>wars start with bombings.</i>

571
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:08,208
<i>Ours did as well.</i>

572
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,625
<i>That day, 140 million euros</i>

573
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:34,041
<i>poured out over Madrid.</i>

574
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,708
<i>That was our way of saying...</i>

575
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,333
<i>"We're back."</i>
