1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,315
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,832
Cube in a cube.
There's another solve.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,056
<i>William and Mia,</i>

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,594
<i>give these coordinates to
the team,</i>

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,239
<i>and then get the hell
out of Star City.</i>

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,994
<i>And whatever you do,
don't come looking for me.</i>

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
I know where these lead.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,839
That's where.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,630
We're going over the wall...

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,550
To The Glades.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,195
I love you so much.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,875
I'll love you even more
when this baby's out of me.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,354
Hyah!

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,594
Hyah!

15
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,359
You're ready.

16
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,233
Mom, I'm home!

17
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,671
Mrs. Carver had that
cheese you love so much

18
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,479
at the store,

19
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,155
the one that tastes
better than it smells.

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,799
Mom?

21
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,315
Mom.

22
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,880
- Hyah!
- Oh!

23
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,431
- Seriously, mom.
- Good instincts. Hi.

24
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,034
How is Mrs. Carver?

25
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,555
Uh, the usual.

26
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,756
She's had to tell me

27
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,274
everyone else's
business in town,

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,636
and she's trying to set
me up with her son.

29
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Henry?

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,154
No. The older one.

31
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,720
Oh, "cowardly lion"
Seth?

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,598
Isn't he more scarecrow,
though? No brains?

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,955
Either way,
not for you.

34
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,235
Where were you?

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,595
Well, I was on
the phone.

36
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,955
A meeting with
Smoak Tech.

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,999
Have you ever thought about
actually going in to work?

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,152
You know, we could get out of
bloomfield, go to the city.

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
I could go with you.

40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,880
Oh, you know the city's
not safe for us.

41
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,679
If anyone ever found out
who your father is

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,830
or who you are...

43
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Right. Right.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,232
But I know how much you
love that company.

45
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,875
And I know how to protect myself.
You made sure of that.

46
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I sure did.

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,679
So if dad's as big a hero
as you say,

48
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,797
then why can't we just
tell everyone that?

49
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,314
It's not
that simple, Mia.

50
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,278
You just have to trust
me on that. I'm sorry.

51
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,039
Hey, I was thinking
a vintage movie night.

52
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,634
A Jordan Peele marathon.

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,873
Yeah. Sure.

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,033
Hand over that cheese.

55
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,432
Shoot. Um... OK.

56
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,918
What the frak?

57
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,840
<i>Intruder.
Access denied.</i>

58
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,036
Frak.

59
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,589
<i>Initiating
self-destruct protocol.</i>

60
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,756
<i>Intruder...</i>

61
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,559
Mia, what are you
doing?

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,600
What am I doing?
What are you doing with all this?

63
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,597
Uh, I can explain in
just one second.

64
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,115
<i>7, 6, 5...</i>

65
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,032
<i>access granted.</i>

66
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,309
This is just
a little something

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,119
that I've been working
on on the side.

68
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,270
For Smoak Tech?

69
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,194
No, not exactly. Um...

70
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,236
There is a corrupt
company in The Glades

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,880
that I am this close
to exposing.

72
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,794
You're hacking again,
like overwatch.

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,997
Oh, well, no, overwatch
was part of a team, right?

74
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,878
Team Arrow.
And this is solo.

75
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,350
So no team,
no complications.

76
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
You're a vigilante.

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,880
No, not exactly.

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,112
Technically, yes,
by definition...

79
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,920
how long have you been
hiding this from me?

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
- Mia...
- how long?

81
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,156
Mia, I can explain.

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,880
You realize I haven't
left this town ever?

83
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,077
I didn't get to go to school
like a normal kid.

84
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,879
I haven't even been
to a real city.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,070
I know.

86
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,799
You told me that we
had to hide here

87
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,400
because dad was
the Green Arrow.

88
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
That's true.

89
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,896
And now I find out that
you've been doing

90
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,559
the exact same thing
the entire time.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,176
No, your father and I
promised each other

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,920
that we would keep
fighting for the city

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,912
to make the city
better for you

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,435
and for... for our family.

95
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,792
I can't sit back
and do nothing, Mia.

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,896
And yet that's exactly what
you're telling me to do.

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,559
No, I'm not. Mia,
this is different.

98
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
- Is it?!
- Yes.

99
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,736
Because I'm starting to believe
what everyone else says,

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,037
that... vigilantes are
the opposite of heroes.

101
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,349
That is just
propaganda...

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,954
oh, says you.

103
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,756
And why should I believe
anything you say again?

104
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,956
Mia.

105
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,311
You've been lying to
me my whole life.

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,754
I don't even know
who you are.

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,616
Mia, Voice-Over:
<i>Mom, I'm going to Star City,</i>

108
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,950
<i>and this time,
you can't stop me.</i>

109
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,670
<i>I need to find out the truth
about everything...</i>

110
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,117
<i>About who our family really is,</i>

111
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,480
<i>what I'm meant to do
with my life.</i>

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,189
<i>I can't be held back anymore.</i>

113
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,233
<i>I need to forge my own path.</i>

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,799
What's
the black star for?

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,275
My mom once told me that
all the starlight we see has

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,680
so far to travel

117
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,912
that the stars might
not even exist anymore.

118
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,198
Eventually, they all just
fade to black, erased.

119
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
That's where I want to be.

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,190
What's all that?

121
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Prize fighting.

122
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,513
How much you make
on that?

123
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,350
A few grand if you win.

124
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,673
I don't lose.

125
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,114
Of course you can do
handstand push-ups.

126
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Ready?

127
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,510
You mean to risk
our lives

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,159
by sneaking into
The Glades? No.

129
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,709
Not at all. You?

130
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,559
Don't have anything
better to do.

131
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,440
Tell me again why we couldn't
just take the tunnels.

132
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,958
There's heat on
the canaries right now.

133
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,235
The tunnels
could be blown.

134
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,277
So we get to do this
the hard way.

135
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,278
Are you coming or what?

136
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,119
Show-off.

137
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,191
This is gonna be
a long night.

138
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,074
Great. Only 5 million
more feet to go.

139
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,152
Rest up. Once we get
in The Glades,

140
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,277
we'll have to move fast,
find Felicity,

141
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,352
and get her out before
anyone knows we were here.

142
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,477
And here I thought
you hated her.

143
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,394
No one gets to kill
my mom except me.

144
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,392
It'd be easier if we
had some backup.

145
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,576
Yeah, well, if you shut up,
you'll catch your breath faster.

146
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,034
I just think it was
a mistake

147
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,376
to not bring the rest
of the team.

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,835
They're not a team.
They're vigilantes.

149
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,319
Their kind ruined
Star City.

150
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,640
They're not the criminals
you think they are, Mia.

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,998
I remember them being
heroes back then.

152
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,514
They only want to
save the city.

153
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,512
- We got eyes on us.
- What?

154
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,632
Save the Arrow. We're OK.

155
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,313
I thought you couldn't
hack Archer.

156
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,758
But you can make yourself
temporarily invisible.

157
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,559
Show-off.

158
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,433
Watch it.

159
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,280
Any luck finding William?

160
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,589
Fight club was empty.

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,995
Wherever he and Mia
are headed,

162
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,992
they're on their
own now.

163
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,514
And you're OK with that?

164
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,233
He doesn't
need my help anymore.

165
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,630
And besides, Felicity
wants us to prioritize

166
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,915
finding those bombs.

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,275
The city's in danger.

168
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,239
And, also, maybe you missed
the vigilante life a little.

169
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,431
Working with a team,
saving the city.

170
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Maybe.

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,793
Any new leads on
locating the bombs?

172
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,473
Just a lot of
shoddy police work

173
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
surrounding
Felicity's death...

174
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,311
missing evidence,
incomplete scene reports.

175
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,880
The case files are a mess.

176
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,792
Well,
I have a contact at the department.

177
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,136
If somebody paid
to have that done,

178
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,435
he would know
about it.

179
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,000
What, you talking
about Anson?

180
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Yup.

181
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,389
I thought he cut you off.

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,550
Hmm, he did.

183
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,313
That's why I have
you two as backup.

184
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,434
You got real balls
coming here.

185
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,960
You wouldn't answer
your phone.

186
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,111
Next time, take the hint.

187
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,680
I told you I can't
help you anymore,

188
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
especially not now.

189
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,115
I need intel.

190
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,429
Intel on what?

191
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,954
The murder of
Felicity Smoak.

192
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,119
I can't help you.

193
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,120
Wrong answer.

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,789
Are you shaking me down?

195
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,296
Actually,
I was really hoping to avoid it.

196
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,176
So why don't you tell me
everything you know, Anson?

197
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,793
Eden Corps.

198
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,114
They paid the SCPD to
fake Smoak's death,

199
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,236
tie up the loose ends.

200
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
Eden Corps hasn't been
active for months.

201
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,715
Well, they are now.

202
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,951
And they don't want
anyone to know about it,

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,117
probably to start
nuking cities again.

204
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I don't know.

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,555
Tell us where they are.

206
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,712
The Glades. Galaxy One's
their front.

207
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,194
Roy. Roy!

208
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,074
Stop.

209
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,155
Stop it!

210
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,633
Come on.
It's time to go.

211
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,160
It's time to go.

212
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,036
So this is how
the other half live.

213
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,840
Sadly, Star City used to
look very similar to this.

214
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,536
These are the coordinates
from Felicity's tape,

215
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,995
which means she's in there somewhere,
hopefully alive.

216
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,640
Galaxy One is one of the
richest companies in the world,

217
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,552
and heavily guarded.

218
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,360
They're not just gonna
let us walk right in.

219
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,440
Actually, that's exactly
what they're gonna do.

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,434
Oh, this is ridiculous.

221
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,671
We need to look the part,
Ms. Executive assistant.

222
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,831
I am definitely higher up
than your assistant.

223
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,416
And that is not what
I'm talking about.

224
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,033
We are the kids of
vigilantes.

225
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,554
The second they scan us,
we're done.

226
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,438
My last name isn't
Clayton anymore.

227
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,680
And, besides,
all the focus is

228
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,157
gonna be on me, the ceo,
anyway, so just play along.

229
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,119
Didn't I ask you to send me the
financials on the Brennan merger?

230
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,395
It should be there.

231
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,035
I need you to reschedule
my 12:00 with optics.

232
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,156
Sir, you need
to scan in.

233
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,430
So push my 12:00
to 3:00

235
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,936
to make room for
Jackson Labs at 1:00,

236
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,016
and then clear my
morning to review

237
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,269
the Jackson Labs R&D.

238
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,317
Prepare
for identification.

239
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,313
DNA match complete. Proceed.

240
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,669
- Hey. You're holding me up.
- She needs to scan.

241
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,016
Don't be ridiculous.
She's just my assistant. Trust me...

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,679
Sir.

243
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,096
Prepare
for identification.

244
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,436
Access denied.

245
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,193
You need to come
with us, miss.

246
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
How about I don't?

247
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,238
<i>- Lockdown.</i>
- Hands up, now.

248
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,754
It's cool, fellas.

249
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,559
Lockdown.

250
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,755
- She's with me.
- Lockdown.

251
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,309
Sorry, agent hawke.
We didn't know she was one of yours.

252
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,592
I know. That's the point.

253
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,955
DNA match complete.
Proceed.

254
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,111
Who the hell are you?

255
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,636
I have been tailing you guys
since the bazaar.

256
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,136
Once I figured out you were
headed here,

257
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,776
I started pulling
credentials for clearance.

258
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,950
As an agent for
Knightwatch?

259
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,509
Which is just what,
the good version of A.R.G.U.S.?

260
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,114
Something like that.

261
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,176
Look, I wanted to tell you
the truth, but I couldn't.

262
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,714
I didn't have a choice.

263
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,072
- Yeah, you did.
- Mia!

264
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,959
I trusted you, but all
you did was lie to me,

265
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
like everyone else.

266
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,157
Look, I'm sorry.

267
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,558
Was any of it real?

268
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
All of it.

269
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,136
OK, as much as I
love relationship drama

270
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,896
when it's not my own,
do you think we could focus

271
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,958
on the task at hand and not
blow our cover immediately?

272
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,430
Thank you.

273
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,720
All right, secret agent guy.

274
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,016
So what do you know
about this place?

275
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,509
All right.
I've been doing recon on the building.

276
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,696
There are hidden
sublevels here,

277
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,074
unlisted to
the General public.

278
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, that's where they
have to be holding mom.

279
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,076
How do we get down there?

280
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,913
My badge isn't
gonna cut it.

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,656
There'll only be a handful
of people with access,

282
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,716
all DNA-based.

283
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,480
Well, I have a meeting with the guy
who runs this place, Keven Dale.

284
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,557
I mean, if anyone
has access, it's him.

285
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,040
All we have to do is steal
and replicate his DNA. Easy.

286
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,510
It actually is.
Look, I have the tech.

287
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,557
You just have to
swipe a sample.

288
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,756
Wait. Me?

289
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,839
No, no. Stealing stuff
covertly. I don't do that.

290
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,359
Well, lucky for you,
your sister does.

291
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,272
Great. I'll locate
the sublevels

292
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,760
while you guys are
with Dale.

293
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,479
I'll find you after.

294
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,878
Let's do
a deep dive into galaxy.

295
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,713
We can see if...

296
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,040
Rene?

297
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,390
Dad.

298
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,709
Damn it, Zoe.

299
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,555
I knew you were involved
with the canaries, but...

300
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,791
I didn't think you were
one of them.

301
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,997
Not only did you not
stay away from my daughter,

302
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,833
but you brought Roy
into this.

303
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,394
I didn't think you
were alive.

304
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,950
Nice to see you, too.

305
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,635
What are you doing slumming
it in Star City anyway?

306
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,838
I still know you're
looking for the bombs.

307
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,036
And you need to stop.

308
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,800
You already know that galaxy's
behind all this, don't you?

309
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,150
This is the part where you're
supposed to tell me I'm wrong,

310
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,960
that my father,
a former vigilante,

311
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,032
is not working with
the bad guys.

312
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,440
The bomb plans you saw...

313
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,477
they're phase one of
what we're calling

314
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,791
the Star City
reformation project.

315
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,917
- Oh, my god.
- You're part of this.

316
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
It's not what you think it is.

317
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
Really?

318
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,936
Because wiping out
an entire city sounds

319
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,996
a lot like genocide.

320
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,471
Look, this isn't about
destroying Star City.

321
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,678
It's about expanding what
we've done in The Glades.

322
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,352
And with galaxy's help,
I'll be able to do that

323
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
within a fraction
of the time.

324
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,832
Everyone will be
safely evacuated

325
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,240
before anything happens.

326
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,834
How is it you
got all the age

327
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,673
and none of
the wisdom?

328
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,911
They're playing
you, Rene.

329
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,475
Galaxy is just a
front for Eden Corps.

330
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,153
Eden Corps doesn't
exist anymore.

331
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,720
And even if it did,

332
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,360
if galaxy was run by
a terrorist organization,

333
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
I would know.

334
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,159
Just like you knew
galaxy was paying cops

335
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,550
to fake
Felicity's death?

336
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,235
Yeah. Yeah, she's
still alive, Rene.

337
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,437
Galaxy's not the enemy.

338
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,831
They've been nothing
but supportive,

339
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,434
altruistic.

340
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,920
SweeTheart,

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
you've seen it.

342
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,597
Yeah, but I wouldn't
allow myself

343
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,353
to be blinded by it.

344
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
You always told me to
rely on my instincts.

345
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,350
What happened to yours?

346
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,193
You need to open
your eyes, Rene.

347
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,999
I did...

348
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,438
And I used to believe
being a vigilante

349
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,273
helped solve problems.

350
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,838
You and I both know
it's not that simple.

351
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Please just let this go.

352
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,394
The father I knew,
the hero...

353
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,476
Would not
have let this go.

354
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,156
You may have
forgotten that hero,

355
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,594
but I haven't.

356
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,856
Thank you for seeing us

357
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,314
on such short notice,
Mr. Dale.

358
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,517
When the ceo of
Harris Consolidated

359
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,353
comes calling,
you answer.

360
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,557
And please
call me Keven.

361
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,877
Can I get you or your
assistant anything?

362
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,957
Actually,
I'm his associate.

363
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,434
My associate, Ms. Margo,
and I would love

364
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,636
some coffee.

365
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,240
3 cups of
the house favorite.

366
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,515
So how can I be of service?

367
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,936
I've heard through
the grapevine that

368
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,031
you've been working with
halcyon pharmaceuticals.

369
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,679
That's supposed
to be hush-hush.

370
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,798
I'm evaluating their firm
for a potential acquisition,

371
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,792
and I was hoping
for some intel.

372
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,031
Before I share my
secrets,

373
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,316
how about you share
one of yours?

374
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,120
How were you able to
get Harris Consolidated

375
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,072
off the ground
so quickly?

376
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,880
Oh, I wish I could say it
was some genius plan,

377
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,350
but, really, it was luck.

378
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,955
An angel investor backed me.

379
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,072
You have to tell
me who.

380
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,197
City of emeralds capital.

381
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,239
But whoever they are,
they've stayed anonymous.

382
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,230
So now that I've
told you my secret,

383
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
tell me about halcyon.

384
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,600
We've ended our arrangement.

385
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,952
They didn't align with
our philosophy.

386
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,474
Which is what?

387
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,398
We want to change
the world.

388
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,392
You can't do that mired
in short-term thinking.

389
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,509
You know what they say
about fidgeters, don't you?

390
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,479
Dreamers
with idle hands.

391
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,554
I assure you,
Mr. Harris,

392
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,109
no one has ever accused
me of being idle.

393
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,554
Huh.

394
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,875
Mr. Harris,
we have an issue

395
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,559
back at
the office now.

396
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,874
I am so sorry, Keven.
The life of a ceo.

397
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,235
I get it.

398
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,359
Keep
in touch.

399
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,399
Oh, he definitely wants
to be in touch.

400
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,638
How goes the search?

401
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,155
Well, knowing galaxy's
behind everything

402
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,550
really nArrows it down.

403
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,632
If the bombs are being
stored in The Glades,

404
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,632
it'll be at headquarters.

405
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,875
Your dad being involved
in all this, uh,

406
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
it can't be easy.

407
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,474
I'm fine.

408
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,237
Let me know when you're
ready to go, OK?

409
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,914
All right.
This is the access point to the sublevels.

410
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,040
It's the only unlisted
elevator bay in the building.

411
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,839
Their Random full-body
DNA scanner

412
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,513
wasn't a dead giveaway?

413
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,632
But how's this swab gonna
trick a full scan?

414
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,439
Watch.

415
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,717
Is that replicating
the DNA signature? How?

416
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,439
Secrets of
the trade.

417
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,198
You want a cookie or
something?

418
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,794
All right. Be ready.

419
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,360
There's no telling
what we're facing.

420
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,476
Stay back and in
the elevator. Understood?

421
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,616
You know, I'm really
enjoying

422
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,393
all these heartfelt
brother-sister moments.

423
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,676
You're just more useful
to me not dead.

424
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,151
I'm sorry. Do you
care about me?

425
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,711
Yeah. Maybe. I'm also
not the only one.

426
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,509
You know your
angel investor,

427
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,671
city of emerald capital?

428
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,594
I think mom might've had
something to do with that.

429
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,433
What do you mean?

430
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,955
Well, emerald for
emerald city.

431
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,636
"The wizard of oz"
was mom's favorite.

432
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,155
We used to read it all
the time when I was little.

433
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,759
I guess she might've
been watching over you

434
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,274
after all.

435
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,869
Hi.

436
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,951
Aah! Uh!

437
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,354
Mia.

438
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,874
Mom.

439
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,390
You are alive.

440
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,716
I told you not
to come.

441
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,433
Was my message not clear?

442
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,000
I wanted you both out
of Star City,

443
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
not to come to
The Glades.

444
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,994
Wow. Really? No "hey, kids,
thanks for the rescue."

445
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,696
Those coordinates were
not supposed to lead you to me.

446
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,758
They are the coordinates of a stockpile
of bombs hidden in this building.

447
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,816
That's why I told you to
give them to Roy and Dinah.

448
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,136
Well, since we're here,
would it be OK

449
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,594
if we got you out of there?

450
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,896
Looks like
this operates

451
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,593
under the same
DNA access protocol.

452
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,716
Just give me a second.

453
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,794
It's
so good to see you.

454
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,960
I never thought
I'd see you again.

455
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,475
Oh, I was afraid you
wouldn't want to...

456
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,710
After everything.

457
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,837
I'm so sorry,
William.

458
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,954
OK, hey, not
to interrupt,

459
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,256
but we've really got
to get out of here

460
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
before someone
realizes

461
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,416
what we did to
those guards.

462
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,477
I can't leave until
I disable the bombs.

463
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,119
You just got
out of danger,

464
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,998
and you want to go
running back into it?

465
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,480
Typical.

466
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,560
You would rather
go play hero

467
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,279
than do what's best
for your daughter.

468
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,589
Mia.

469
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
- Mia, come on.
- Stay out of it.

470
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,276
For once in your
life, mom,

471
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,314
put your family
first.

472
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,553
Being a hero, Mia,

473
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,835
means choosing
other people's safety

474
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,470
above your own,
including your family.

475
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,672
That's why I hid
my work from you

476
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,576
so that I could protect you
from having to make

477
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,920
difficult decisions
like these.

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,856
You should've just been honest
with me from the beginning.

479
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,155
You were right.

480
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,760
I am so sorry.

481
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,991
Being a hero is my purpose.

482
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,829
I can't leave.

483
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,718
Then I want to help.

484
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,515
Seriously?

485
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,671
I'm sorry, but she's right.

486
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,833
Where to?

487
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,274
The next sublevel.

488
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,352
Well, if you're going,
you're gonna need this.

489
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Thanks.

490
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,077
- Look, Mia...
- Don't.

491
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
You OK?

492
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,113
Yes, I am used to being
a disappointment to her.

493
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,296
The explosives are
being stored

494
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,834
in the east end of
the building.

495
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,195
Are there any guards
in our way?

496
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
The coast looks clear,

497
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,196
except for 3 heat signatures
headed straight towards us.

498
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,359
They should be
right on top of us.

499
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Zoe?

500
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,640
You found her.

501
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,035
It is so good
to see you alive.

502
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,397
You could've told us we
were on the same side.

503
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,676
To infiltrate Eden Corps,
I had to be the calculator.

504
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,796
It was the only way.

505
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,696
Looks like your plan worked
out a little too well.

506
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,155
Well, I'm glad my old team
came to the rescue.

507
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,395
Thank you for
helping William.

508
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,834
Where's Mia?

509
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,559
Mia is...

510
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,960
So much
like her father.

511
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,397
Sorry for not telling you
about her, by the way.

512
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,636
Guys?

513
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,155
The coast is clear between
us and the bombs.

514
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,877
Hurry up.
We have to move.

515
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,919
Didn't you want to go
with them?

516
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,799
Hey. I am only here
to back you up.

517
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,839
Right. 'Cause you
promised your daddy.

518
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,519
You know, I am really not
sure what's worse.

519
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,319
The, um, the lying

520
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,790
or the fact that you actually
thought I needed protection.

521
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,435
Mia,
I know that you can take care of yourself.

522
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,136
Then why the hell
do you keep hanging around?

523
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,311
Because I care
about you.

524
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,869
OK. I wanted to tell
you the truth,

525
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,391
but I knew that you
would hate me

526
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,755
the minute I did.

527
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,152
And every day, it just
got harder and harder.

528
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,197
So your big idea

529
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,033
is that I would just
never find out.

530
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,877
Do you have any
idea what it's like

531
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
to find out

532
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,656
that your entire
relationship with someone

533
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,909
is based on a lie?

534
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,560
No, OK? But I know
what it's like to have

535
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,154
heroes for parents.

536
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,154
It sucks.

537
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,994
Man, I used to ask
my dad all the time

538
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,914
why he even adopted me

539
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,435
if he and my mom were
never gonna be around.

540
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
But you know what?

541
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,274
When I got older,
I realized...

542
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,160
I was proud of them.

543
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,311
You were proud that
they prioritized

544
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,119
the rest of
the world above you?

545
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,113
OK, no, not
that part. But...

546
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:54,320
With great power comes
great responsibility, right?

547
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,113
Oh, come on! Spider-man?

548
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,680
I'm not really
into comic books.

549
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,390
OK, my point is
that the same applies

550
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,709
to us superhero kids.

551
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,793
And we have to learn
to share our parents

552
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,113
and be a little selfless.

553
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,873
Of course you would
say that.

554
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,120
You've been
a hero in training

555
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
since you
were a kid.

556
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,158
Well, so have you.

557
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,993
The only difference is
I got to choose,

558
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,197
and you never got
to make that choice...

559
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,429
Until today.

560
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,839
There's your
ulterior motive.

561
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,296
Look, Mia, if you
go out that door,

562
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,755
you are doing exactly
what Felicity wants.

563
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,954
OK, you want to go?
We will go.

564
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,440
You want to
stay? We will stay.

565
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,759
But do not
let her mistakes

566
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,079
make your choice
for you.

567
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,958
It's on you now.

568
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,152
This has to be the place.

569
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,430
There's someone
coming.

570
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,074
So what'd we miss?

571
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,395
Ohh, you came back.

572
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,073
Don't make
a big thing of it.

573
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,996
What the hell?
Where are the bombs?

574
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,040
They're already onsite.

575
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,320
Dad.

576
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,116
What are you
doing here?

577
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,156
You are alive.

578
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,391
No thanks to you

579
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,472
or your friend
Keven Dale.

580
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,194
You were right.

581
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,156
You all were right.

582
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,557
The attack on Star City
is happening tonight,

583
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,831
and there is zero plan
to evacuate.

584
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,000
Dale plans to pin the blame
on a vigilante.

585
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,879
I'm guessing that's why
they were keeping Felicity.

586
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,792
I can't say
I'm surprised.

587
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,478
What opened your eyes
all of a sudden?

588
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,315
Someone very smart with
impeccable genetics

589
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,959
reminded me of who
I used to be.

590
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,117
And why should
we believe you?

591
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,270
Aren't you the evil
mayor

592
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,113
who's been trying to
destroy Star City?

593
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
And who are you?

594
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,239
This is Mia. These
are mine and Oliver's

595
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,674
impeccable genetics.

596
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,080
You and Oliver have a kid?

597
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,196
Surprise.

598
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,192
OK, now that
we are all caught up,

599
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,600
what time
do the bombs go off,

600
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,790
and how do we stop them?

601
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,456
They're set to go off
during the fireworks

602
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,711
in exactly 38 minutes.

603
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,016
Even if we knew where
the bombs were,

604
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,096
that's not enough time to climb
over that wall and stop this.

605
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,176
There is
another way.

606
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,793
The bombs are linked
by a li-fi,

607
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,576
which means there's an
exterior power source.

608
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,016
You're talking about
a unified connectivity device.

609
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Yes.

610
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,176
It's like the brain
of the bombs.

611
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,536
Oh, good. Now there
are two of you.

612
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,056
So wait. We're just supposed
to break into some server room

613
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,878
so you guys
can hack into it?

614
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,429
"Server room"!
How 2019.

615
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,496
The brain is a portable cube shape.
It fits in your hand.

616
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,640
Dale has something
like that.

617
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,757
I thought it was just
a fidget cube.

618
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,336
The only way to stop the
bombs is to destroy that device.

619
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,616
Dale's gonna be at
the celebration,

620
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,632
but he won't be
easy to find.

621
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
He cut a deal

622
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,354
for a permanent Archer
blind spot.

623
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,920
There's always
another way.

624
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,469
I heard these Glades
parties are pretty fancy.

625
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,233
How are we supposed
to fit in?

626
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,319
Except for you.

627
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,914
Leave that part to me.

628
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,154
This is looking
for a needle

629
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,993
in a very creepy
haystack.

630
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,696
I'll take that to mean
you're in position.

631
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,552
Everyone else?

632
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Almost.

633
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:35,241
Looks like Rene's become
quite the celebrity.

634
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,638
Overwatch,
we are in position.

635
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,870
"Overwatch"?

636
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,356
No one's called me overwatch
in a very long time.

637
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,990
OK, can we save the walk down
memory Lane for after, maybe?

638
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,719
All right.
What do we got to do?

639
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,517
Everyone here is wearing
functional textiles,

640
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,536
so there are tiny computers
embedded in their clothing

641
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,755
and yours.

642
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,176
When the fabrics touch,
the sensors will send us

643
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,475
all their electronic data.

644
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,296
Normally,
their privacy settings restrict that,

645
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,640
but I bypassed them.

646
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,110
So you're
hacking clothes?

647
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
Pretty much.

648
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,193
Your job is to identify
Keven Dale.

649
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,096
And I can help with that
via the security feed.

650
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,918
Let's go save the city.

651
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,080
That's not Dale.

652
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,358
OK, Mia, at your 2 o'clock,
there is a man in a blue suit.

653
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,999
He could be
a potential match.

654
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,197
I don't mean match-match.
I mean target.

655
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,795
I mean, I don't even know what your type is.
Is it...

656
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,280
mom, shut up.

657
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,919
OK, sorry. Rambling.
Old habits.

658
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,759
Mia, you just brushed Dale.

659
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,957
Got him.
I'm following him inside.

660
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,599
Hold on. You're gonna
need backup.

661
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,194
<i>You won't have comms
in there.</i>

662
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,999
Isn't this what you
trained me for?

663
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,720
I can handle a ceo.
I got this.

664
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,836
Nobody wants to tell you,
but your festival sucks.

665
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,360
Interesting. I was
expecting a canary.

666
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,150
Who the hell
are you?

667
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,633
Not a fan of chitchat.

668
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,709
Now, hand that thing over,
or I'll take it.

669
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,316
Really?

670
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,919
Take her alive. We'll talk
after the festival.

671
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,271
Oh, this'll be fun.

672
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,314
Guys, I lost him. He's
in the crowd again.

673
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,914
OK, not to freak
anyone out,

674
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,336
but this is our
two-minute bomb warning.

675
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,396
We need to thin the herd.

676
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,153
I know how.

677
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,274
Show them what heroes
look like.

678
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,114
Help! Vigilantes!

679
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,638
Oh, you have
30 seconds, Mia.

680
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,154
Mia!

681
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,630
She did it. The bombs
are deactivated.

682
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,879
Let's get the hell
out of here.

683
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,872
Citizens of The Glades,

684
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,834
last night, our
independence day festivities

685
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,078
were attacked in an apparent
act of terror.

686
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,914
Thanks to the tireless efforts
of The Glades p.D.,

687
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,834
we know the identities of
the perpetrators responsible...

688
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,556
the vigilantes known

689
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,640
as Arsenal, Black Canary,
and the calculator.

690
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,315
A reward of $10 million will
be paid

691
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,111
for any info leading to
their capture, dead or alive.

692
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,480
This was our first attack
within our walls

693
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,711
in over a decade.

694
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,951
I vow to you it will be
the last.

695
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,672
Well, that was disturbing.

696
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,717
I know why my dad had
to make that speech,

697
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,200
but hearing it
out loud?

698
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,237
We did already have a
target on our backs,

699
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,710
just, well, not
quite that big.

700
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,360
Well, it's about to get
rougher for everyone.

701
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,999
Including my dad.

702
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,436
I know you're worried,
but he is right.

703
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,318
The best way
to take down galaxy is

704
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,516
from the inside.

705
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,159
So what now?

706
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,356
So I'm guessing
galaxy's

707
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,000
not just gonna stop
at bombing the city.

708
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,954
No. The purpose of the
bombing wasn't to rebuild.

709
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,479
It was to remake Star City
in The Glades' image.

710
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,599
Why would Dale
want to ruin a city

711
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,034
he spent so much money
to fix?

712
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,816
Because he's gonna use
the shiny new Star City

713
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,752
as a proof of concept
to take Archer global,

714
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,832
and that's too much power
for one entity to have.

715
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,856
Well, it's a good thing we
got the band back together.

716
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,917
Well, we can thank William
for that one.

717
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,799
I sent that signal out
on a hope and a prayer.

718
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,230
And you kept it.

719
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,416
After all these years and with
everything that's happened,

720
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,920
I...

721
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,515
I know I don't deserve it.

722
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,956
Well, I'm glad I didn't
completely hate you.

723
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,471
Now I got a sister
to hate instead.

724
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,034
I need some air.

725
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,640
So maybe we don't really have
that type of relationship yet.

726
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,114
It's not you.

727
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,000
- I should go talk to her.
- And it's not you.

728
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,834
It's me.

729
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,635
Who needs a drink?

730
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,560
Mr. Mayor, impassioned
speech you gave.

731
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,710
It really made me believe

732
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,269
you want
those vigilantes dead.

733
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,829
They violated the
sanctity of our walls,

734
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,189
not to mention they
destroyed

735
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,078
our plans for expansion.

736
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,629
Yes, I want them dead.

737
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,233
They were your friends once.

738
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,039
Your point?

739
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,439
Well, they seemed
to know exactly

740
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,433
what we were planning
and how to stop us.

741
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,919
Seeing how it was your
desire

742
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,993
to evacuate Star City,
I can't help but wonder...

743
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,198
you did not tell me about
moving up the bomb timeline

744
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,073
till I pressed you
on it.

745
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,471
If I'd known,
maybe you wouldn't have kept Felicity Smoak

746
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,233
in the same damn
building.

747
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,389
The attack by
the vigilantes

748
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,597
has provided us
an opportunity.

749
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,230
Because a city in fear
desires a solution.

750
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,279
What is that?

751
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,194
The tool that will allow
us to take Archer global

752
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,079
and eliminate
all vigilantes for good.

753
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,913
Oh, wow.

754
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,713
So this is where you have
been spending

755
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,393
all your time.

756
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,193
Pretty much.

757
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,636
Still not a fan of
cleaning, I take it.

758
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,393
You want to start
by nagging?

759
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,439
Oh, I'm your mother.
Nagging is part of the deal.

760
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,309
So what, you probably want
me to come help stop galaxy?

761
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,680
A little mother-daughter
vigilante time.

762
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,355
No. I wish I could take
you away from all this.

763
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,270
I wish that you didn't have
to think about any of this.

764
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,320
But I know that that is
not my decision to make.

765
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,392
You know, when I
first left home,

766
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,553
I was so mad at you.

767
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,954
I learned everything I
could about vigilantes.

768
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,759
I dug up
old news stories

769
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,719
about how they
destroyed Star City.

770
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,957
I was convinced...

771
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,319
I was convinced
it was true

772
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,553
that you had lied to
me my entire childhood

773
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,872
with your...
your stories

774
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,953
of the heroism
of Team Arrow.

775
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,870
Because you didn't
want me

776
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,280
to think badly
about you.

777
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,679
Or about dad.

778
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,830
I spent these past years
hating vigilantes...

779
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,479
Because I hated you.

780
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,119
Well, I don't blame you.

781
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,999
I understand why you
wanted to lie to me...

782
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,356
to protect me.

783
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,599
I can't even imagine
what it was like

784
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,559
having the entire
city turn on you

785
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,315
and turn on dad.

786
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,839
Mia, you are
so much like your father.

787
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,232
Out on that field,

788
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,791
so badass.

789
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,393
I'm so proud of you.

790
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,593
Mom, there's, um...

791
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,040
It seemed like there is
something really personal

792
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,950
about you stopping
galaxy.

793
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
Is that about dad?

794
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,593
No, it's not.

795
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,433
That one is on me.

796
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,037
Holy crap. Did that work?

797
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,715
Here goes nothing.

798
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,238
Archer, are you online?

799
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,677
<i>Yes, Ms. Smoak.</i>
