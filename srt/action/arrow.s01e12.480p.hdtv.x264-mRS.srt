1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,479
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,733
Run, run!

3
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,329
No, no, no, no, no!

4
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,402
Oh, come on, man!
I'm just trying

5
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:53,937
to make
an honest living!

6
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,772
There's nothing honest
about what you do!

7
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:57,824
Who supplies you with Vertigo?

8
00:00:57,826 --> 00:00:59,676
Tell me now and you live.

9
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,828
Please!
They'll kill me!

10
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,564
Whoever you fear...

11
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,366
Fear me more!

12
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,168
Okay, okay!

13
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,871
We call him The Count,
that's all I know.

14
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:14,207
I swear to God!

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,545
Hey!

16
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,580
Get me down
from here!

17
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,549
Find what you're looking for?

18
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:25,051
Took down three Vertigo
pushers tonight, Diggle.

19
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,419
Last one finally knew a name.

20
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,054
The Count.

21
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,373
The Count?
That's worse than The Hood.

22
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,225
You're not going
back out there.

23
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:34,194
I'm not done
for the night.

24
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,479
Whoever this Count is,
he has a lot of blood on his hands,

25
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,148
and it is long past time
he started paying.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,700
Well, slow down, I think
you're missing the point here.

27
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,435
What?

28
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,904
Thea.

29
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,706
Her hearing's
in a few hours.

30
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,641
You think she cares more
about some drug lord

31
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,276
getting his
just desserts,

32
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,358
or you being by her side
when she needs you the most?

33
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,969
Hey, we should
get going.

34
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,821
Judges don't
appreciate the value

35
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:03,339
in being
fashionably late.

36
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:06,363
Got any other tips?

37
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,397
Let the lawyer
do all the talking.

38
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,982
They'll give you
a pad and paper

39
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:12,234
but do not play
tic tac toe.

40
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:15,454
Judges don't
appreciate that, either.

41
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,625
Come on, Speedy.

42
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,126
I know, I know.

43
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:24,830
Keep on trying
to get up and go,

44
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,365
but...

45
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,300
just don't.

46
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:31,203
I wish dad were here.

47
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,873
I'm here.

48
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,927
We should leave now, Thea.

49
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:41,313
Ms. Queen.

50
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,432
Thea, over here.
Can we get a comment?

51
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,933
Just one comment!

52
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,903
Thea, are you
going into rehab?

53
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:51,357
Miss Queen, are you being
dispelled from Balliol Prep?

54
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,076
Are you worried
about the outcome?

55
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:57,029
Docket ending 1-10-5-6,
People vs. Thea Dearden Queen.

56
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,614
Possession
of a controlled substance,

57
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:01,283
driving under the influence
of a controlled substance.

58
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,306
Counselors, I understand
you've reached a plea agreement.

59
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,375
We have, Your Honor.

60
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,959
Given that my client
is a juvenile,

61
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,961
the people have generously
agreed to probation.

62
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:15,180
Juvenile?

63
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:17,016
Says right here she's 18.

64
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:18,634
She is 18 now,
Your Honor,

65
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,085
but at the time of arrest,
she was still two days shy

66
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,970
of her 18th birthday.

67
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,222
Ms. Queen
has no priors.

68
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:24,606
Well, just because
Ms. Queen's family

69
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,725
sweeps her priors
under the rug,

70
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,060
doesn't mean they don't exist.

71
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,529
You get your client off,

72
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,731
and you help your boss
avoid dealing with the drug

73
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,651
that's sweeping across
our city like the plague.

74
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:37,486
Everyone wins, except us,

75
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:38,954
the people of Starling City.

76
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:40,222
Your Honor,
with all due respect--

77
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:42,291
Ms. Queen,
like it or not,

78
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:45,127
you are now the poster child
for this menace.

79
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,529
Maybe if people see
that the Queen family

80
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,798
can't get away
with using Vertigo,

81
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,668
they'll think twice
before using it themselves.

82
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,236
The plea arrangement
is denied.

83
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,424
This case will
proceed to trial.

84
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:07,516
They can't do this.

85
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:10,102
That man cannot send
my daughter to prison.

86
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:11,937
What are our options?

87
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,572
An interlocutory appeal.

88
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:17,142
But trial judges have discretion
to reject plea agreements.

89
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,578
I think you might want to
prepare yourself for the possibility

90
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,281
that this isn't going
to go our way.

91
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.

92
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:26,919
I'll get to work
on the appeal.

93
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:31,957
Well, so much for the best
criminal defense attorney in the city.

94
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:37,096
Thea, we will handle this,
I promise.

95
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:40,265
Like you promised Walter
you'd always stay faithful to him?

96
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,351
I feel better already.
That's enough!

97
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,853
Don't worry.
Sounds like you won't

98
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:47,773
have to be putting up
with me much longer.

99
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:53,178
What, does she not realize
how serious this is?

100
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,482
She took drugs.

101
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:58,650
She drove. She could have
killed someone, or herself.

102
00:04:58,652 --> 00:05:01,153
I know.
All that judge is looking for

103
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,739
is someone to make
an example of.

104
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:06,408
What does it have to be her?

105
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,977
Maybe it doesn't.

106
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:13,165
Listen, I have to go
do something.

107
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,634
Are you going
to be okay?

108
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:19,471
I'm not the one facing prison.

109
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:39,107
You working
for them now?

110
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,326
Why are you
doing this to me?

111
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:43,946
I thought
we were friends.

112
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:47,732
Or...something.

113
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:51,670
I mean, why'd you bother
keeping me safe

114
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:53,789
if you were just going
to hand me over to them?

115
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,881
Just get me out of here.

116
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:07,686
I can't.

117
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,189
Hey! Don't leave me here!

118
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,140
I came back for you!

119
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,643
Do you hear me?

120
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,396
I came back for you!

121
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:25,719

Hi. Looking
for Detective Hall.

124
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,745
I was told
he works in Vice.

125
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:36,081
Oliver?

126
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,383
McKenna Hall.

127
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:39,801
Hi.

128
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,720
Here I was,
expecting a middle aged guy

129
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:43,121
in a bad suit...

130
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,257
And I got McKenna Hall.

131
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,125
I live to surprise.

132
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,677
Well, I remember.

133
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,178
What was that club
that you got us kicked out of?

134
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,647
The Club Deville?
Okay, in my defense,

135
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,515
there was no sign
that specifically said

136
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:55,234
you had to keep
your clothes on.

137
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:57,269
So, a cop?

138
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:59,804
I guess you're not hitting
the party circuit anymore.

139
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:02,024
I still go to raves.

140
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:03,992
I just go
undercover now.

141
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:05,661
And I have to dress
slightly more appropriately

142
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,747
to hide my badge and gun.
Right.

143
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,933
So what do you need
with a vice cop, Oliver?

144
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,418
Vertigo.

145
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,456
Right. I saw your sister on TV.
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,790
The judge is trying
to make an example of her.

147
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,175
So I was thinking,

148
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,710
if you could find the person
selling the drugs,

149
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,962
it make take some
of the heat off Thea.

150
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:26,298
Easier said than done.

151
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,334
Did some digging
and came up with a name.

152
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:31,553
Um, The Count?

153
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:35,974
Oliver, we've known
about The Count for months.

154
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:37,109
Oh.

155
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,894
I wish this
was thicker,

156
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:40,646
but we really don't
have much on him.

157
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:42,731
Love to say we're
going to catch him

158
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,317
before your sister's
trial, but it's highly unlikely.

159
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,786
Oh, I am late
for my shift.

160
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,122
Well, if you hear
of anything about this guy,

161
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,125
just...let me know?

162
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:57,462
I always loved how much you cared
about your sister.

163
00:07:57,464 --> 00:08:01,083
But leave the policing
to the police, okay?

164
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:02,918
Okay.

165
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:14,479
What did Queen want?

166
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:17,015
He's an old friend,
sister's jammed up.

167
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:19,518
Anything else,
Sergeant?

168
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,219
No.

169
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:41,123
You need a tailor.

170
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,457
You know about
the hood guy.

171
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:43,742
He just
cornered me, man.

172
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,093
The hood guy?

173
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,412
I didn't
say anything.

174
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:49,548
Oh, I know.

175
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,150
You can't divulge secrets
you don't know.

176
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,138
But...

177
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,557
examples must be made.

178
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:04,029
Vertigo,

179
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:07,449
in its purest form.

180
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:09,484
When injected directly
into the bloodstream,

181
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,903
it affects the thalamus
region of your brain.

182
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,789
Which is where all
of the information

183
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,957
from your pain receptors
is collected.

184
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,943
No doubt you're in
excruciating pain.

185
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:21,112
But actually, you're not.

186
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,615
You just think you are.

187
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,300
I've seen it last for days,

188
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:28,336
until finally
the heart gives out.

189
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:36,678
One bullet left.

190
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:43,101
Now, you can use
that bullet to shoot me

191
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:44,820
and take your revenge,

192
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:47,939
or...you could
shoot yourself.

193
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,975
It's your choice.

194
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,963
The Hood.

195
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,566
Coming for me.

196
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:19,971
Interesting.

197
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,652
I'm learning you're not much
of a morning snuggler.

198
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,299
And I'm learning that
you don't like to wake up

199
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,983
at any hour
that ends in a.m.

200
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,285
That's true. Yeah.

201
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,086
So if you're busy
being a lawyer all day

202
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,506
and I'm managing
a night club all night,

203
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,641
when exactly do we get
to see each other?

204
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,376
Hmm.

205
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,812
I got it. Stay.

206
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,551
Hey.

207
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:11,936
Hey.

208
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,689
Hey, how--
how is Thea holding up?

209
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:18,058
She's doing okay.
Thank you.

210
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,693
Um...Actually, I--

211
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:22,696
I came to talk
to Laurel.

212
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,031
Yeah.

213
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,584
Hi.
Hi.

214
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,119
Thank you for coming
to court yesterday.

215
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,421
Yeah, of course.

216
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,905
But I don't think
the judge is willing

217
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:34,124
to move off his position.
Taking a hard line

218
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,261
against criminals is
a platform for his reelection.

219
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,463
I need you to talk
to your father.

220
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,633
He's inside the system,
and...maybe he cashes in

221
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,302
a chip with Judge Brackett,
gets him off throwing the book at Thea.

222
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,688
Oliver, I don't--

223
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,257
Laurel, I am working
on something on my end,

224
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,476
but...

225
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,278
If it doesn't work out,

226
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,764
this is my best chance
to help my sister.

227
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:00,434
Please.

228
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,437
I'll see
what I can do.

229
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,939
But no promises.

230
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,192
Thank you.

231
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:11,945
Yeah.

232
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,505
Absolutely not.

233
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,257
Dad, I know
how you feel about Oliver.

234
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,426
Then why would you even
ask me to do this.

235
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,344
Because Thea,
she's only 18 years old.

236
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,980
Which makes her an adult.
She can take her medicine.

237
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,266
It's about time someone
in the Queen family did.

238
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,767
What about
the Lance family?

239
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,903
A young girl
acting out,

240
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,521
engaging
in reckless behavior,

241
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,740
does that sound
familiar?

242
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:41,609
Laurel,
don't go there.

243
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,328
Thea, she's just like
I remember Sarah.

244
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,497
That is not how
I remember your sister.

245
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,165
That's because
you remember her

246
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,533
the way that you
wish she had been,

247
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,785
not the way that
she actually was.

248
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:54,588
She's not the Saint that
you make her out to be.

249
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,374
I know she was arrested
for shoplifting

250
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,376
and I know
you made it go away.

251
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,512
Well, maybe
if I let her go to jail,

252
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,214
Queen wouldn't have had her
on that damn boat.

253
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,051
Dad, you make it sound
like he kidnapped her.

254
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,835
For so long,

255
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:11,972
you and I have blamed Oliver
for Sarah's death,

256
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:13,974
but Sarah's
to blame, too.

257
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:16,293
When I look at Thea,

258
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,646
I see Sarah's
potential in her.

259
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,230
And her flaws, too.

260
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,651
Yes, Thea made
a mistake.

261
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,036
But she's been
through a lot.

262
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,456
She lost a father
and a brother.

263
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,659
She doesn't need prison.

264
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,461
She needs help.

265
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:36,630
So please...

266
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:45,806
I'll make some calls.

267
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,400
I've seen a fair amount
of Cyrillic back in Afghanistan

268
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,152
left over
by the Soviets.

269
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,154
Is this Russian owned?

270
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,655
This is the not
so hidden headquarters

271
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,657
for the Starling City
chapter of the Bratva.

272
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,226
Diggle...

273
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,112
Whatever I say,

274
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,731
whatever goes down,

275
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,450
just go with it.

276
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,452
Zdravstvuyte.

277
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,621
Good to see you.

278
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,506
Long time.

279
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:22,292
Particularly
for Bratva captain.

280
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,411
I was trying to figure out
where to put my interests.

281
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,464
I decided on pharmaceuticals.

282
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,351
I don't mean aspirin.

283
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,419
A wise choice.

284
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,973
Mepheodrone would be a good
investment for you.

285
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,592
It's the newest thing.

286
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,861
I was thinking Vertigo.

287
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,596
Newer thing.

288
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,481
Tough market, Vertigo.

289
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,700
Only one seller.
I know.

290
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,535
I was hoping you could
do me a favor

291
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,055
and arrange a meeting.

292
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,906
He's difficult man.

293
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:56,994
And he does not
like new friends.

294
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,999
This is everything
the police have on him.

295
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,785
Tell him it's a gift.

296
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:12,142
I will see
what I can do.

297
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,396
Provided you do
favor for me.

298
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:17,297
Vse chto ugodno.

299
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:22,519
It is unusual
for an American

300
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,855
to hold such
a position of esteem

301
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,242
in our organization.

302
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,028
Mr. Queen.

303
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,280
Anatoli Knyazev.

304
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,249
He speaks
very highly of you.

305
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:38,419
He should.
I saved his life.

306
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,257
What did he do?

307
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,259
Something
I told him not to.

308
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,461
Now the favor.

309
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,863
Kill this man for me,

310
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,516
and I will believe
your interest

311
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,052
in our organization
is genuine.

312
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,773
And then I will arrange a meeting
with The Count.

313
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,598
Oliver...
Hey, shut up!

314
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:30,036
What are friends for?

315
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,424
I'm out of the gates
now. What's going on?

316
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,145
Are we getting
out of here?

317
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,813
Where are you taking me?

318
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:17,434
While I admit that bout
was particularly one-sided,

319
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,086
would anybody else
like to give it a try?

320
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:26,393
The point of these little
gladiatorial distractions

321
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:29,980
is to strengthen
unit cohesion.

322
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,282
To that end, I think

323
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,318
our newest recruit
ought to be afforded

324
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,104
the opportunity
to try his hand.

325
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,836
I can't believe
you just killed that guy.

326
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,340
You really have
a low opinion of me.

327
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,750
Whoa! That's a neat trick.

328
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:11,219
You going to teach me
that one day?

329
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,524
No.

330
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,577
What are you doing?

331
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,362
You need to arrange
a new identity for this guy.

332
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,529
Get him out of the city.

333
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,415
Right, so your Ruskie pal

334
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,450
draws out The Count,
vigilante takes him down.

335
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,369
No, Diggle,
because then the Bratva

336
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,371
would know that I used them,
and that relationship is too valuable.

337
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,339
I do the meet
with The Count as myself,

338
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,210
let him leave, then we follow him
to his hideout.

339
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,711
Just that easy, huh?

340
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,664
Well, I will still need
my trust bodyguard.

341
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,634
Fantastic. Looking forward
to my new and exciting career

342
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:44,170
as a drug dealer.

343
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:46,807
He's a captain.

344
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,509
And he has money.

345
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:51,945
Are you interested?

346
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,780
Hmm.

347
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:56,933
Let's say...yes.

348
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,227
My father was able
to get Judge Brackett

349
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,712
to back off
his hardline stance.

350
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,064
Your father hates me.

351
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,432
No.
No.

352
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:11,768
My father hates him.

353
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,822
Look, nobody asked you
to get involved.

354
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,157
I did.

355
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,159
The judge has agreed
to a sentence

356
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:21,862
of 500 hours
of community service

357
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,063
and two years of probation.

358
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,900
Provisional on the appointment
of someone to act in loco parentis.

359
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,135
In loco what?

360
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:30,620
It means that
the court will appoint

361
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:34,174
an individual to assume
responsibility for you.

362
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,427
Me.

363
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,045
I say thanks,
but no thanks.

364
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,847
Thea!

365
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,182
You don't actually
have a choice.

366
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:44,768
Oh, actually, I do.

367
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,355
See, I'm 18 now and I can make
my own decisions.

368
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:53,827
So I decide not to be
your ex-girlfriend's office monkey.

369
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,564
Well, if you change
your mind, then.

370
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,539
Thank you.

371
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,490
Yeah.

372
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,661
Thea...

373
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:15,332
You're in real trouble,
and rightly so.

374
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,384
Doing drugs
and driving?

375
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:20,170
It is beyond stupid. That is
a good deal that Laurel got you.

376
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,254
Why aren't you
jumping at it?

377
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:23,673
I already have a mother.

378
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,225
So...

379
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:26,726
you're going
to go to jail

380
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:29,012
and it will ruin
the rest of your life.

381
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:30,630
No.

382
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,066
I want to ruin mom's life.

383
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:35,986
She's a liar and a cheat.

384
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:38,271
I mean, deal with, Ollie.
You can pretend

385
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:40,240
all you want to
that she's a saint,

386
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:42,909
but I hate her.
And she betrayed dad.

387
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,946
So you're just--you're going
to go to jail to spite her?

388
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,649
Thea...

389
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:54,037
Mom didn't cheat on dad.

390
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,506
He cheated on her.

391
00:20:56,508 --> 00:21:00,060
Is that the best
you can come up with?

392
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:05,048
Dad wasn't the man
he said he was.

393
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,951
On "The Queen's Gambit"
right before he died,

394
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:11,488
he admitted to me
that he failed us.

395
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,739
You.

396
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:16,543
Me. And mom.

397
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:20,130
That he wasn't the man
he said he was

398
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:23,349
and that he just wished...

399
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:28,088
he wished he had more time
to right his wrongs.

400
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,290
I don't believe you.

401
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,425
Yes, you do.

402
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:36,296
Leave me alone.

403
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:42,952
How dare you.

404
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:46,539
She was old enough
to know the truth.

405
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,516
Oliver, the Russians called.

406
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,885
The meet is set.

407
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:02,522
It's tonight.

408
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,696
You know why
they call him The Count?

409
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:12,499
When he was
developing this drug,

410
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,400
he experimented
on the homeless.

411
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:17,370
Prostitutes, runaways.

412
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,039
The police
would find their bodies,

413
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,291
puncture marks
on their neck,

414
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:22,876
like a vampire.

415
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:31,017
You should not be in such a hurry
to meet this man.

416
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,280
Thank you for this.

417
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:46,483
But I'm not
overly concerned

418
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:47,734
about the SCPD.

419
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:50,286
Now, I understand
you gentlemen

420
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:53,156
wish to participate in
the feel good business.

421
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:56,409
Yes.
And why is that?

422
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:57,877
Well, I am opening
a nightclub,

423
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,947
and I'd like my customers
to have a little...

424
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:03,049
something extra.

425
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:05,552
Well, as it happens,

426
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:08,555
I'm looking
to expand my brand.

427
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:15,995
A good wine's value is measured
by its vintage.

428
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:18,765
The number of years
it took to ferment.

429
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:23,186
Vertigo is measured
in lives.

430
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,808
56 people died

431
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,077
to perfect this high.

432
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,280
Believe me when I say
that they did not

433
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:38,317
die for nothing.

434
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:51,014
The cops!

435
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:52,098
We've been set up!
Let's get out!

436
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,768
Go! Go!

437
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:58,638
SCPD! Put your weapons down!

438
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,011
Down!

439
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:10,650
Oliver!

440
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:13,236
Hey!

441
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:19,409
No witnesses.

442
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:41,014
Get out of the car!

443
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,218
Keep it.
Yeah, we got to go.

444
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,337
Steps. Let's go.

445
00:25:10,138 --> 00:25:12,573
Oliver!

446
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:18,612
Drink.

447
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:43,470
Wait!

448
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,072
Mornin'.

449
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:14,968
How you feeling?

450
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,754
I feel like
I'm getting

451
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:20,090
the worst hangover
of my life.

452
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,542
That coming from a guy who spent
most of his twenties in a hangover,

453
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:24,845
that's really saying something.

454
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:28,932
You think
you can uncuff me?

455
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,984
Not going to kill you.

456
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:33,387
Promise.

457
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,527
Ahh.

458
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,867
You're standing.

459
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,735
That's pretty impressive.

460
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:53,340
The Count only got you
with half a dose,

461
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:56,076
but you still sweated out
a small swimming pool coming down.

462
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:59,263
The Count.

463
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:02,433
Any chance our friends
in SCPD took him down?

464
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:05,752
None at all, but we did
manage to get this.

465
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,472
Think we should analyze it.

466
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:12,592
Listen, Oliver, maybe you need
to give it a few hours.

467
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:14,994
A near drug overdose isn't something
you just walk away from.

468
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:21,435
Neither is Thea.

469
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:28,709
What's wrong?

470
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:31,128
Is everything
okay with Thea?

471
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,046
This isn't about your sister,
this is about you.

472
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:36,300
Last night we got a call
from a C.I.,

473
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:39,503
busted up a drug sale between
a big time dealer and the Russian mob.

474
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:42,506
"We"? I thought
you worked Vice.

475
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:45,409
Joint task force. Vertigo's
got everybody holding hands.

476
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:47,377
Like I said...

477
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:51,932
Last night,
drug deal gone south.

478
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,501
An eyewitness
put you at the scene.

479
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:57,237
Whoever he is,
he's mistaken.

480
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,222
Yeah?

481
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:00,441
I saw you, Oliver.

482
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:05,929
Is this true?

483
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:09,116
I was checking
into The Count.

484
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,751
He's the guy who
sold drugs to Thea.

485
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:13,086
And I figured if I could find out
what he looked like,

486
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,289
then I could give your sketch artist
something to go on.

487
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,925
So I paid a low-life
with a Russian accent

488
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:19,877
an obscene amount
of money to arrange a meeting.

489
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:21,211
And? Did you get eyes on him?

490
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,696
No.

491
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:26,500
All right, are you pressing charges
against my son?

492
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,304
You get involved
in this again,

493
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,939
you'll see the inside
of a cell,

494
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:33,724
and unlike last time,
you will not see the way out.

495
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:35,108
Detective.

496
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,144
Thank you very much.

497
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,532
Thank you for what
you did for Thea.

498
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:44,568
My daughter asked me
for a favor and I did it.

499
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,187
And that's the end of it.

500
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:55,862
Hope you don't think
I sold you out.

501
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:59,199
No. Just doing your job.

502
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:04,755
What on earth
were you thinking?

503
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:06,089
I was trying to help.

504
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:07,391
By running around
with the Russian mob

505
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:09,176
and a murderous
drug dealer?

506
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:10,811
Are you out
of your mind?!

507
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:12,896
Mom, look,

508
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:14,481
the real reason
that you're upset

509
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:17,518
is because I told Thea
the truth about dad.

510
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,436
She never needed
to know that.

511
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:22,105
Yes, I did.

512
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:25,526
I'm old enough
to know the truth, Mom.

513
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:31,782
It wasn't about
your age.

514
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:38,705
It was about preserving
your memory of your father.

515
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,707
He loved you.

516
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:44,411
No matter his faults,
he loved you.

517
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:47,881
I said that I wished

518
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:50,217
you had died
instead of him,

519
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:53,920
but...you still
didn't say anything.

520
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,722
Why?

521
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,693
One day,

522
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:03,196
I hope you're lucky enough
to have a daughter,

523
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:06,516
and you'll know why.

524
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:11,438
I'm so sorry for what I said.

525
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,908
I know, I know.

526
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,920
Now what?

527
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:28,622
Like you said,
we analyze the Vertigo.

528
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:30,641
It's in liquid form,
which means it contains water.

529
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,293
So maybe we can
trace back to where

530
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:34,612
in the city The Count is...

531
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,299
cooking up this garbage.

532
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:42,423
Hey, we need
to get you to a hospital.

533
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,475
No.

534
00:31:44,477 --> 00:31:46,177
Oliver, God knows
what was in that drug.

535
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,762
It could be causing
permanent damage.

536
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:49,180
Felicity.

537
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:52,316
Hey, they said
you'd be up here.

538
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:54,652
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

539
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,771
Not that there are cats
in this building.

540
00:31:56,773 --> 00:32:00,608
Well, once a cat did get in,
but a guard tazed it.

541
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,278
It smelled like fur and static
in here for like a week.

542
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,063
Ahem.

543
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:07,782
Would you mind stepping
away from the window for a moment?

544
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:10,401
I have a little bit
of a hangover.

545
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:12,453
Sounds like you need
a bloody Mary and a pretzel,

546
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:14,572
not the I.T.
Department.

547
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:16,174
Actually, my buddy Kevin

548
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:17,708
is starting
an energy drink company.

549
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,645
He says it's fantastic
for curing hangovers,

550
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,763
but I am very particular

551
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:24,131
about what it is
I put in my body.

552
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,250
I've noticed.

553
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:28,219
I said, not noticed.

554
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:29,253
Right?

555
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,024
I'm trying to find
a secret recipe.

556
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:34,609
Could you please
do a spectroanalysis

557
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,394
of the sample
and find out exactly

558
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:39,197
where in the city it's made?

559
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:42,066
If it's an energy drink,

560
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,918
why is it
in a syringe?

561
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,321
I ran out of sports bottles.

562
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,911
Okay.

563
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:59,950
Your B.S. stories
are getting worse.

564
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:03,137
I'm well aware.

565
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:05,139
Looks like Felicity
came through.

566
00:33:05,141 --> 00:33:07,225
The solvent used
in the Vertigo sample

567
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,894
was run off water originated
within a ten block radius

568
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:13,848
of where East Glades
meets the bay.

569
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,933
Nothing there except
for an old juvenile detention center

570
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:18,069
abandoned about three years ago.

571
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:19,937
Cutbacks.

572
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:24,242
You can't go out there,
though, Oliver.

573
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,777
You're still suffering
the after-affects of the Vertigo.

574
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:27,995
Did you hear The Count?

575
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:30,164
He's taking
this drug citywide.

576
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,483
If we don't stop him now,
this becomes an epidemic.

577
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:34,318
I can stop you from leaving.

578
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:39,624
Try.

579
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:48,165
Oliver, you hit this
and you can leave.

580
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:15,576
I'm glad you came
to your senses.

581
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:18,462
You should always
remember one thing, Dig.

582
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:19,580
What's that?

583
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:22,032
I don't need the bow.

584
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:17,521
My C.I. swears
this is the place.

585
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:19,724
Bring your men
up on the flank.

586
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,559
Okay, this way.
Follow me.

587
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:24,895
He's here!
He who?

588
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:27,198
The Hood!

589
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:45,132
Looks like we're not
the only guests.

590
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:48,419
You should have stuck
to your depraved elite.

591
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:52,056
I am merely providing people
with what they want.

592
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:54,425
I am providing
a public service!

593
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,927
So am I.

594
00:36:07,572 --> 00:36:10,741
Enjoy the fruits
of your labor.

595
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:16,447
Freeze! Put down the needle!

596
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,699
Or I will shoot you!

597
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:28,443
Put down the syringe.

598
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:31,598
He deserves this!
Not according to the law.

599
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:32,768
The people that think
you're a hero,

600
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:35,470
people like my daughter,
if they could see you now...

601
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:36,771
You're no hero.

602
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,024
You're what I always
said you were--

603
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:42,694
a killer.

604
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:46,865
Get him!

605
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:55,540
Get me an ambulance. Now!

606
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:03,281
Juvenile delinquent
reporting for duty.

607
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:04,949
Since you lost
your driver's license,

608
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:06,985
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
6:00.

609
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:08,670
We have a lot of work
for her to do.

610
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:11,222
Well, then, let's say
7:00 just to be safe.

611
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,974
Is it too late
to choose jail?

612
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,309
Yes.
Yes.

613
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:16,928
I need you to go
through these files

614
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,647
and pull out all the documents
dated March 2007.

615
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:21,883
Do you think
you could do that?

616
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:24,135
I think I can.

617
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:27,906
I know I messed up.

618
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:31,659
I really appreciate
this, Laurel.

619
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:33,411
We are going to make
an upstanding citizen

620
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:35,646
out of you yet, speedy.

621
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,834
Thank you.
And this will be good for her,

622
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:41,753
having a role model,
somebody better than me.

623
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,671
Oh, you're not so bad.

624
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:46,490
And besides, it'll be nice
to have her around.

625
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:52,096
I got to take this.
Excuse me.

626
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:53,431
Hello?

627
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,266
We got The Count.

628
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,051
Bust up his lab,
got him on everything

629
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:59,187
from drug trafficking
to homicide.

630
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,339
He'll be gone
for a long while.

631
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:03,308
That's great, thanks.

632
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,010
It was great
seeing you, Oliver.

633
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:08,646
You, too.

634
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:10,615
See ya.

635
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:16,788
He's still critical.

636
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,122
I've never seen
anyone OD

637
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:20,241
on this much Vertigo
and live.

638
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:21,743
There's just
no way of knowing

639
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,494
what kind of damage
has been done to his brain

640
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:24,796
and nervous system.

641
00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:26,197
Or if its irreparable.

642
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,737
Shengeun...

643
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:43,440
Survive.

644
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,512
Hi.
Hi.

645
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:07,631
Thanks for meeting me.
I was...nervous

646
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,016
to come to your house.

647
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:10,684
Okay...

648
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,653
The thing is,

649
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:14,405
I've been debating
whether or not

650
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:16,857
to share this
with you for weeks.

651
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:19,443
Can I trust you?

652
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:21,946
I'm not an idiot.

653
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:25,249
You've dropped some fairly
ridiculous lies on me,

654
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:29,453
and...yet I still feel
like I can trust you.

655
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:34,208
Why is that?

656
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,793
I have one
of those faces.

657
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:39,547
Sorry.

658
00:40:39,549 --> 00:40:42,116
Yes.

659
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:45,452
You can trust me.

660
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:49,339
Then I have something
to show you.

661
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:13,664
Have you ever
seen this before?

662
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,532
No.

663
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:19,587
Where'd you get it?

664
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:22,473
From your stepfather.

665
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,845
From Walter.

666
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,680
Um...

667
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:32,650
Well, where did
he get it?

668
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:38,022
He said he found it
in your house.

669
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:40,991
That it belongs to your mother.

670
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:45,446
Walter thought
she was hiding something.

671
00:41:45,448 --> 00:41:49,850
Something more, and...

672
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:53,337
He wanted me to look into it,
but then he vanished.

673
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:57,875
I think this list might have cost
Walter his life.

674
