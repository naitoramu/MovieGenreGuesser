1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,925
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,202
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,811
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,564
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,442
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,362
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,369
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,086
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,047
Time to choose, Oliver.
Who lives and who dies?

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,208
In 30 seconds, I will shoot them both.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,927
- You got what you came for!
- I guess you made your choice. Time's up.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,485
No! No!

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,891
- Stick that in me, I'll kill you.
- No, brother Roy. You'll kill for me.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,491
Where'd you get the Mirakuru?

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,526
It was a gift. A gift I will use
to save this city from itself.

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,930
The man in the skull mask.

17
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,764
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,486
You're the biggest street dealer
in Crescent Circle.

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,446
You know everything that goes
on over there. Who is he?

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,241
I ain't seen the guy before. I mean... a
skull mask? Are you freaking kidding me?

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,808
- Come on, man. I'm still on parole.
- Not anymore.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,480
A spokesman
for the Central City Mayor's Office...

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,171
confirmed the lack of any damage
or radioactive fallout...

24
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,967
from the explosion that rocked
S.T.A.R. Labs five weeks ago.

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,084
Is Felicity not back yet?

26
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,090
She says she wanted to spend
a few more days with Barry.

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,808
Any improvement in his condition?

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,361
Still comatose.
How'd it go out there tonight?

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,246
Same as every other pointed conversation I
have with these lowlifes at Crescent Circle.

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,851
Nobody...

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,131
has seen a man in a skull mask.

32
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,250
He's still out there.

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,016
Oliver, for the past
five weeks, you've been

34
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,001
pushing yourself pretty
hard looking for this guy.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,883
He has the Mirakuru, Diggle.

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,122
You saw what it took to kill one guy
that had been injected.

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,802
We practically had to drop a
building on him. Imagine, uh, 10.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,241
Or a hundred. Imagine a thousand.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,486
- You said Roy was injected.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,687
I've just never seen you
spooked like this before.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,568
I should tell you something.

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,403
Shado always told me that
I wouldn't die here.

43
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,122
But looking back, I realize that
she never once said that about herself.

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,767
I just hope that she's with her father now.

45
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,805
Here, kid.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,684
She'd want you to have that.

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,564
You're the one she cared for.

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,167
Slade.

49
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,409
Hey, Ollie. Just give him space.

50
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,803
I can't keep lying to him, Sara.
I need to tell him how Shado really died.

51
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,883
Ivo killed Shado.

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,169
- He pulled the trigger.
- Because I chose to save you.

53
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,602
- He needs to know the truth.
- Ollie, look.

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,604
He has the Mirakuru in his system.

55
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,649
What does that have to do
with anything?

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,767
Look the Japanese, they experimented on
hundreds of men working to develop Mirakuru...

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,530
and I read the research.

58
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,690
The people who died,
they were the lucky ones.

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,042
The ones who survived,
they were deformed.

60
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,969
Either their bones or their minds.

61
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,606
They became someone else.

62
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,563
You summon me here for a drink?

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,200
- You certainly look dressed for it.
- No, I have a date.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,610
- What are you working on?
- Something to do with Sebastian Blood.

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,048
A.K.A. the next mayor of Starling City.

66
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,124
- Well, maybe he shouldn't be.
- What does that mean?

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,964
I've just been doing some investigating.

68
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,767
Blood had a connection
to the Langford Psychiatric Institute.

69
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,806
The one that burnt down
under very mysterious circumstances.

70
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,411
Did the police suspect arson?

71
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:01,705
No. They're saying
that it's inconclusive.

72
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,685
But Blood also knew Cyrus Gold...

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,520
the man that shot and killed
four police officers.

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,487
- Laurel, where are you going with this?
- I don't know. But I do have to go.

75
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,846
I'm gonna be late.

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,764
So who's the lucky guy?

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,128
Sebastian Blood.

78
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,001
He is the man we need to see
in the mayor's office.

79
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,091
So please join me in our efforts
to send Starling's favorite son there.

80
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,085
To Sebastian Blood.
Sebastian for Starling.

81
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,966
Thank you, Oliver.

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,362
And not just for your support...

83
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,528
but also for your friendship.

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,763
And thank all of you for coming.

85
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,926
You know, when Oliver calls me
a son to Starling City...

86
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,441
it feels like the literal truth.

87
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,203
I was a street orphan,
and this city raised me as one of its own.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,129
I am the man that I am today
because of my Starling City family.

89
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,368
So it's time that I start to give back.

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,289
So thank you all for your support.

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,523
Nice speech, Ollie. I didn't know
you cared so much about politics.

92
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,768
Well, I care about the city...

93
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,131
and Sebastian has become
something of a friend.

94
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,121
He's got a way of doing that, apparently.

95
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,049
- That's very cute.
- Heh.

96
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,810
Speaking of which, how's Roy?

97
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,811
Oh, handsome, brooding, usual.

98
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,971
Why is my boyfriend
such a topic of interest?

99
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,085
Well, Thea, his idol
put an arrow in him.

100
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,951
I just wanted to make sure there
aren't any lingering issues.

101
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,804
Oh, my God.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,190
Now that I think about it,
you know he did something

103
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:41,949
completely out of
character this morning.

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,885
- What?
- He showed up for work on time.

105
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,405
Heh.

106
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,005
Thea.

107
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,325
- It's just wonderful.
- Proud to do my civic duty.

108
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,570
No, I'm the one who's proud.
You've taken Oliver's hobby...

109
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,127
and turned it
into a successful business.

110
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,606
Hobby?

111
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,007
Oh, sweetheart.

112
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,681
- Oliver.
- Ah!

113
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,769
Thank you so much for your kind words.

114
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,928
I'm speaking the truth.

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,124
Forgive me, a friend just walked in.

116
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,809
- Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,291
Glad you could come.

118
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,564
Sebastian invited me.

119
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,601
Yes, I hear the two of you have been
spending a lot of time together.

120
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,564
We're just friends.

121
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,841
Does he know that?

122
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,041
Uh-oh. What's holding you back?

123
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,363
Sometimes I feel like
I don't know the real Sebastian.

124
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,402
He reminds me a little of you that way.

125
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,291
Hm.

126
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,525
Freedom.

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,926
Liberty.

128
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,245
Justice.

129
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,841
Long have the people...

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,047
of this city suffered
under the shackles of a corrupt government.

131
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,128
Slaves to self-interested politicians...

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,166
and their lobbyist puppeteers.

133
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,490
I declare war on them all.

134
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,601
Anyone in the building?

135
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,889
Cleaning crew and a group of bankers
working on a late-night deal.

136
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,964
- Can you patch me in to police and fire?
- I'm on it.

137
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,882
- Diggle.
- Hey, man, this is not my thing.

138
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,498
I can't get in there,
everything's locked.

139
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:40,465
We've still got people
on the fifth floor.

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,921
It's too hot. We're falling back.

141
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,723
Help! Gary's still back there.

142
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,330
Get to safety.

143
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,566
Give me your hand.

144
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,250
Thank you.

145
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,806
Hey.

146
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,764
You okay?

147
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,365
Where are you going?

148
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,725
To the plane. To get geared up.

149
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
For what?

150
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,768
Ivo is still out there.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,163
I'm gonna find him, and when I do,
I'm gonna cut pieces off him.

152
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,688
You can't.
Ivo has a ship full of men, of killers.

153
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,326
I don't care what you did before.
You can't take them all out.

154
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,842
The only play here
is to find safe ground and wait him out.

155
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,328
Of course you would say that.
You were working for Ivo.

156
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,609
- You're probably still working for him.
- Hey. Hey!

157
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,727
- She's not.
- Get out of my way, kid.

158
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,649
You just need to take it easy.

159
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,044
- I said...
- Agh!

160
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,402
Get out of my way.

161
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,360
You okay? Long night.

162
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,245
Yeah. News reports say
the bomber didn't steal any money.

163
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,607
I think this guy just wants
to make a statement.

164
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,529
That went online an hour ago.

165
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,247
His manifesto. Three hundred
pages of anti-government hate.

166
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,364
You think this psycho is anyway connected
to our psycho in the skull mask?

167
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,562
This guy has
a completely separate agenda.

168
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,680
He's a lone wolf and we need to find him
before he finds his next target.

169
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,002
I'd start with the bomb.
Every one's unique.

170
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,527
Maybe we can get some
kind of signature on the guy.

171
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,563
But the bomb residue's with the SCPD.

172
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,003
Fortunately, we have an in
with one of the officers at the department.

173
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,162
I thought you were staying
in Central City for a few more days.

174
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,443
I got a newsletter about the bombing.
Caught the first train out this morning.

175
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,721
Good.

176
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,126
We need you here.

177
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,291
How's Barry?

178
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,881
He's still sleeping.

179
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,291
I prefer sleeping to coma
because coma sounds, you know...

180
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,085
not fun.

181
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,844
I'll reach out to Detective Lance.

182
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,691
Hey.

183
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,890
Did we have a lunch today?

184
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,684
No, I was just in the neighborhood.

185
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,569
- Thought I'd stop by.
- Ah.

186
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,849
But if this is a bad time,
I mean, I can always come back.

187
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,407
No, not at all.
They're still setting up out there.

188
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,085
Wow.

189
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,080
This is pretty impressive
for a street orphan.

190
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,368
Are you suggesting I spread it on
a bit too thick last night?

191
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,369
No, it's just...

192
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,882
Laurel, if there's something on your mind,
give it voice.

193
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,163
I don't bite. I promise.

194
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,529
- You know my father's with the department.
- Yes.

195
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,986
He said the suspect that
he was investigating

196
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:19,227
when he and his partner
were attacked was...

197
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,329
a man named Cyrus Gold.

198
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,807
Cyrus Gold...

199
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,807
was a preacher
at the orphanage where I was raised.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,800
Cyrus was a very good friend to me,
like an older brother.

201
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,761
Or even a father figure,
to be honest.

202
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,128
He was the first person I said a word to...

203
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,931
and this was after a month
of not speaking at all.

204
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,521
You talk a lot about being an orphan.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,571
But you don't talk about your parents.

206
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,451
Did you know them?

207
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,682
My father was a very unhappy man.

208
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,005
One night, he came home...

209
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,770
soaked in whiskey.

210
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,928
He lost his job again...

211
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,963
so he broke her arm.

212
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,167
I tried to stop him, but he threw me off.

213
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,167
The next thing I saw was my mother
holding my father's gun in her hand.

214
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,889
And I watched her shoot him.

215
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,404
She panicked.

216
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,604
Ran, and was gone
before the police even arrived.

217
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,611
That was the last time I saw my parents.

218
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,366
I'm so sorry.

219
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,323
I don't know...

220
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,645
why Cyrus' life took the turn
that it did, I'm sad to say.

221
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,404
All I know...

222
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,522
is that he helped a very young,
very frightened boy find his voice again.

223
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,371
Ahem. I'm sorry.

224
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,130
More later?

225
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,289
Didn't hear you come in.

226
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,524
Yeah, sorry, I got here early.

227
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,486
I just wanna get these crates unpacked
before lunch.

228
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,449
Are you okay?

229
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,489
Yeah, I'm fine.

230
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,361
Just haven't been sleeping much lately.
I got a lot on my mind.

231
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,050
You wanna talk about it?

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,526
- Talk about what?
- Whatever's been going on with you...

233
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,001
the last five weeks.

234
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,485
- I'm fine.
- Ever since the Arrow shot you...

235
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,048
you've been acting really weird, Roy,
with me, with everything.

236
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,163
This isn't about the Arrow.

237
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,881
- Is it me?
- Unh.

238
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,313
Is it us?

239
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:17,434
Look, I just really wanna
get through this, okay?

240
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,687
Okay. Let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

241
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,921
Thea.

242
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,766
Heh.

243
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,289
You do help.

244
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,130
Every day.

245
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,447
Honestly, right now, you're the only thing
that's keeping me together.

246
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,048
I do what I can.

247
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,322
How did I get to be so lucky?

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,203
- You stole my purse.
- Mm.

249
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,640
Roy?

250
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,564
Thea. You okay?

251
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,046
Your arm.

252
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,249
That looks really deep.

253
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,851
It might need stitches. Um...

254
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,890
I'm gonna go downstairs and
get the first aid kit, okay?

255
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:27,915
Okay.

256
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,569
You know, most cops, they meet their
informants in the backseat of a cruiser...

257
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,246
or maybe a coffee shop
or something.

258
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,802
- What's with the mask?
- Gift from a friend.

259
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,049
- You got friends?
- Did you bring me what I asked for?

260
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,609
That's a sample of everything
the CSU collected from the blast.

261
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,406
There's melted glass,
multiple explosion fragments...

262
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,523
trace residue that looks like
nitroglycerine.

263
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
Which means that we're dealing with
more than just a basement nutjob.

264
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,164
Someone with training.

265
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,963
Thank you, detective.

266
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,168
I need a favor too.

267
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,525
The son of a bitch
who killed my men, my partner...

268
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,006
He's dead.

269
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,205
But whoever tipped him off and told him
we were coming, he's doing just fine.

270
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,487
What do you need?

271
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,848
Cell phone records for every cop
in my precinct.

272
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,760
You think there's a leak in the department?

273
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,740
I think those phone records are
the only way to know for sure,

274
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,049
and your blonde friend, she is
pretty good with computers.

275
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,321
I'll ask her...

276
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,641
DC-52 to Central, 10-80, downtown.

277
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,087
He's hit again.

278
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,960
- Starling City Municipal Building.
- Gimme a location.

279
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,289
I'll give you one better.
I'm checking the surrounding cell towers.

280
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,121
There was a GSM spike of 3800 megahertz
two seconds before the blast.

281
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,130
That frequency is way outside the
approved frequency for U.S. carriers.

282
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,848
Signal's moving.
I think he's mobile.

283
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,724
Give me an intersection.

284
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,205
Right in front of you, 400 meters.

285
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,004
I see him.

286
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,200
Turn left on 67th.

287
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,286
Felicity, I've lost him.

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,161
What?

289
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,363
Me too. Hold on.

290
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,483
Got him. Bank left on Gerrard Street.

291
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,162
You're almost on top of him.

292
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
It's not him, Felicity.
You picked up the wrong signal.

293
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,849
What? I thought...
He must have scrambled the signal.

294
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,764
It doesn't matter.

295
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,489
He's gone.

296
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,970
What happened?

297
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,964
He's using cellular technology
to detonate his bombs.

298
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,646
Clearly his expertise extends to
obscuring that signal.

299
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,491
Felicity, your expertise
was supposed to trump his.

300
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,325
Excuse me?

301
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,967
If you have something
to say to me, Oliver, say it.

302
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,363
People are dying. So I'd like you
to pull your head out of Central City...

303
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,435
and get back in the game.

304
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,434
Sure, right after you get
yours out of your ass.

305
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,369
- Excuse me?
- All right.

306
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,847
- Maybe we should just take a breath here.
- No, wait, I wanna know.

307
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,440
What exactly was that crack
about Central City meant to imply?

308
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,927
When the first bomb went off,
you weren't here.

309
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,726
And when the second bomb went off,
you sent me the wrong way.

310
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,410
After you didn't catch
him in the first place.

311
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,365
Don't blame me
because you didn't have it tonight.

312
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,921
I need some air.

313
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,562
At the risk of me getting
my head knocked off,

314
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:55,787
playing the blame game
is not gonna help us...

315
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,365
catch this son of a bitch.

316
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,562
Neither is doing things halfway.

317
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,682
Is that what you think's
going on here, Oliver?

318
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:04,108
You think she was distracted,
she wasn't giving it her all?

319
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,841
She almost ran me into a bus, Diggle.
What do you think?

320
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,495
I think you didn't have a
problem with Felicity's

321
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,184
performance until she
met Barry Allen.

322
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,926
I'm sorry.

323
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,720
You're not well, Slade.

324
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,126
It's the Mirakuru.

325
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,565
It's messing with your head.

326
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,004
It's gonna be dark soon.
We should make camp.

327
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,209
Yeah. What's going on? You okay?

328
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,849
Yeah, arm still hurts when it's cold, and
I lost the pain meds the doctor gave me.

329
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,765
- How's yours healing up?
- You know, good days and bad.

330
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,401
Yeah. That's gonna help.

331
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,761
I'll see you later.

332
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,369
- Hey.
- Pretty crazy.

333
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,005
Yeah, you doing all right?

334
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
I thought I could use your
help if you have a second.

335
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,794
You being at the D.A.'s
office now, it's almost

336
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,112
like you joined the
family business, come on.

337
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,567
I'm trying to find someone
named Maya Resik.

338
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,049
I've searched the internet, the D.M.V.
records, social security, nothing.

339
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,284
- Why are you looking for a ghost?
- Sebastian's paying her bills.

340
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,324
A woman who doesn't seem to exist,
I find that suspicious.

341
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,402
Thinking that your
boyfriend's up to no good,

342
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:01,185
that's typically more
my thing than yours.

343
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,850
He's not exactly my boyfriend.

344
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,129
Then that makes digging into his life
a little less fun then.

345
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,970
Hey, Laurel, I bring you something back,
you know I'm gonna wanna know why.

346
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,089
Of course you are.

347
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,645
Ladies and gentlemen,

348
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,087
we are about to join
Sebastian Blood's press conference.

349
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,727
Oh, you're just in time to see the show.

350
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,129
- What's he doing?
- Bringing the city together.

351
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,011
And if I'm not mistaken, campaigning.

352
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,007
Tomorrow night, I am holding Starling's
first-ever unity rally at City Plaza.

353
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,720
We're going to show the world
that the people of this great city...

354
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,121
will not back down to terrorists.

355
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,164
He's committing suicide and he
just invited the city to join him.

356
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,160
Sebastian's your friend.
Can't you talk him out of this, Oliver?

357
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,921
- But that ends now.
- Well, he won't listen to me.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,043
Sebastian Blood?

359
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,807
This rally tomorrow night...

360
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,041
you need to call it off.

361
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,523
The Starling City vigilante paying a visit
to wave me off.

362
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,931
I'm flattered.

363
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,405
This event, Mr. Blood, you might as well be
painting a giant bull's-eye on your chest.

364
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,451
This city needs to come together.

365
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,370
And I need to show them how.

366
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,928
You won't be able to show them anything
if you're dead.

367
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,604
Every night, you risk your life
for the people of this city.

368
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,843
How can you expect me to do any less?

369
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,729
And what about the lives of the people
coming to your rally?

370
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,201
This rally is about Starling
City standing up and

371
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:52,871
declaring with one voice that
living afraid isn't living.

372
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,887
I won't send a contrary message to people
telling them to stay home, to stay scared.

373
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,287
I've made my decision.

374
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,881
That's the thing, alderman.

375
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,046
Whatever happens tomorrow night...

376
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,770
it's not up to you.

377
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,048
Ah, Mrs. Fazekas.

378
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,131
A train set for your nephew just came in.

379
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,519
He's gonna love it.

380
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:37,429
Oh, you are a miracle worker, Mr.
Scheffer.

381
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,931
How much do I owe you?

382
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,168
Fifty dollars even.

383
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,408
Forget the sales tax.

384
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,763
Are you going to the Alderman's
unity rally tomorrow night?

385
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,809
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

386
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,728
Gathered here despite the rash of
bombings that have plagued the city.

387
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,885
Some have called Sebastian Blood's unity
rally a cynical and dangerous P.R. stunt...

388
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,482
for his mayoral campaign,
but the crowd continues to grow.

389
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,290
I tried to get him to stand down.

390
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,091
He's as stubborn as you
when it comes to fighting back.

391
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,571
Or everything.

392
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,198
Is this how it's gonna be
with youn two from now on?

393
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:12,588
Maybe we should just
head down to the rally.

394
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,046
Maybe we won't have to.

395
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,761
I analyzed the bomb remnants
we got from Lance.

396
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,051
Design's identical to
the bombs used by an

397
00:27:19,076 --> 00:27:21,507
anti-government militia
group called The Movement.

398
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,366
Lucky for us, they have a very active
and hackable message board.

399
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,126
One of their fans has an IP address
right here in Starling.

400
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,169
- Tell me.
- The Computer's in a local souvenir shop.

401
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,051
The wackadoo in question
goes by the username Shrapnel.

402
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,341
You want backup?

403
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:37,667
No, I need you at the rally.
Cover our bases.

404
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,727
Is this all for me?

405
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,968
No, for me, SCPD phone records.

406
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,970
Why are you going through
the department's phone records?

407
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,960
Um, so I checked up
on your not-exactly boyfriend.

408
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,525
And, did you find anything?

409
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,569
Yeah, it turns out he's a hell of a guy.

410
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,482
He covers the expenses of his dear aunt,
your Maya Resik.

411
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,402
If Sebastian has other family,
then why was he placed in an orphanage?

412
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,844
Well, maybe because aunt Maya is nuttier
than a Snickers bar.

413
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,003
She's a patient at St. Walker's Hospital.

414
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,800
That's a mental institution, it's
the kind you don't check out of.

415
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,241
Now listen, are you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

416
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,762
Something about him just seems off.

417
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,247
Laurel, there's nothing sinister
about a guy...

418
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,324
who's covering the expenses
of his only living relative.

419
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,761
The truth is it's kind of nice.

420
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,001
Listen, I've gotta get to City Plaza.
Pike wants all hands at this unity rally.

421
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,528
- You're not going, right?
- No, I need to look into this more.

422
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,608
Laurel, he seems like a good guy,
and you deserve good, okay?

423
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,327
So stop looking for reasons
to talk yourself out of it.

424
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,170
Please.

425
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,851
Alderman Blood, is this not dangerous?

426
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,625
Why are you gathering all these
people here to be targets?

427
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,065
I'll get to all of your
questions later, I promise.

428
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,531
Thank you all for coming.

429
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,326
Boom.

430
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,086
You're dead.

431
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,486
Or will be, if you take one more step
or move a single muscle.

432
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,284
And then you'll miss the show.

433
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,687
Candidate Blood's unity rally.

434
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,089
Already rigged with 50 pounds
of R.D.X. high explosives.

435
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,925
Not unlike what's packed
inside the drywall of my store.

436
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,249
This city thinks Sebastian Blood
can keep them safe.

437
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,809
Tonight, they'll learn the only thing politicians
care about protecting is their jobs.

438
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,561
- Felicity.
- Here.

439
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,489
- Did you get him?
- No.

440
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,650
He said he rigged the plaza
with an explosive device.

441
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,763
Oliver, it's crazy town here,
that bomb could be anywhere.

442
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,681
- I can narrow that down. Get me Diggle.
- Go.

443
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,282
Shrapnel said he rigged
the perimeter with R.D.X.

444
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,130
I'm on it.

445
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,960
- You're heading to the plaza too, right?
- Not yet.

446
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,367
I need you to pull me up anything you can
on the store.

447
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,729
Blueprints, permits, schematics, anything.

448
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,241
- What's going on?
- Shrapnel left behind a surprise.

449
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,331
He said he packed the drywall with
explosives, but the trigger needs to be...

450
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,528
Would need to be hooked
to some sort of a power supply.

451
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,246
That's assuming the detonator's
connected to the stores electricity...

452
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,205
and not something independent
like a car battery. I know.

453
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,650
Not helpful. You sure you want me doing this?
My head might not exactly be in the game.

454
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,241
- Felicity.
- That building was built in the '70s.

455
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,521
That's good news.

456
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,851
The wiring in a lot of construction
back then is defective.

457
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,824
So, if you sever one
wire, it'll blow fuses

458
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:00,631
in the building, shut
off power to the bomb.

459
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,484
Hold tight, I see a fuse box.

460
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,011
Oliver, be careful.

461
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,930
Oliver?

462
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,885
Oliver?

463
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,929
It's all right, I'm all right.

464
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,401
Get to the rally.

465
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,080
Help Diggle. I'm on my way.

466
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,445
Thea, I really don't think coming here
was a good idea.

467
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,927
It's gonna be fine, let's just go find Roy.

468
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,967
Please, please.
You're the ones who deserve an ovation.

469
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,081
Eight months ago,
this city survived a devastating attack.

470
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,490
But we rose up.

471
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,611
You rose up and banded together
just like we are tonight.

472
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,422
Dig, I'm on site.

473
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:18,912
I'm on the east side. I
think I found the trigger.

474
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,090
And proved to the world
that we cannot be broken.

475
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,202
That the people of this
city are too strong.

476
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,361
And that no bomb and no earthquake
is strong enough to tear us apart.

477
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,834
Oliver said that the
whole place was rigged

478
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:37,068
with explosives. It's
in the sound equipment.

479
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,287
This is the trigger.

480
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,602
Shrapnel activates it
by cellular transmission.

481
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,286
Listen, we don't have to disarm it,
just disable it.

482
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,689
I can do that.

483
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,564
I think. I hope.

484
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,446
Felicity, be careful.
He probably put in a safeguard.

485
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,600
Tampering with it will set
off a dead-man switch.

486
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,206
That is a thoroughly depressing term.

487
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,243
And a little bit sexist.

488
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,204
Step away.

489
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,605
Or we all know how this ends.

490
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,206
Dig!

491
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,244
Mom.

492
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,451
I'm okay. I'm okay.

493
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,930
Drop the bow.

494
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,845
I've got charges planted all over Starling.

495
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,125
I drop this stick, they all blow.

496
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,250
- Did you just hear what I said?
- Yep.

497
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,321
Hey, how's your mom?

498
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,329
She's fine, just a little shaken up.

499
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,400
You saved her.

500
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,688
- I got lucky.
- That wasn't luck.

501
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,928
It was impossible.

502
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,044
You know those stories of moms lifting cars
to save their kids?

503
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,045
Things you can do when adrenaline hits?
It was one of those.

504
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,970
Your arm.

505
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,488
There's not even a mark.

506
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,968
- I heal fast. It's fine.
- Roy...

507
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,606
I'm kind of tired.
It's been a long night, you know?

508
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,006
I gotta go.

509
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,806
Roy.

510
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,004
With you dropping fewer bodies, Starling
City should probably build a bigger jail.

511
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,328
Another night of skull mask hunting?

512
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,604
Not exactly.

513
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,451
- How's your shoulder?
- Oh, just a through-and-through.

514
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,881
- Walk in the park.
- Still, Diggle.

515
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,528
You should go home and get some rest.

516
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,489
I'm sorry.

517
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,241
Were you apologizing to me,
or were you talking to your quiver?

518
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,924
I didn't snap at my quiver.

519
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,606
- You kind of more than snapped.
- I know.

520
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,881
And I'm sorry.

521
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,405
I understand that this Mirakuru thing
has you freaked out.

522
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,811
And I have been in Central City a lot.

523
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,082
Felicity, it's not that.

524
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,847
When you are there...

525
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,131
Well, it just made me realize
how much I need you here.

526
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,884
In the beginning, I was just gonna
do all of this by myself.

527
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,521
And now, with you and Diggle...

528
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,443
I rely on you.

529
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,565
Well, does that mean I have a shot
at employee of the month?

530
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,841
No.

531
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,442
Because you're not my employee.

532
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,129
You're my partner.

533
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,401
Barry's gonna wake up.

534
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,169
And when he does, you will be there.

535
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,364
I finally have a guy who's
interested in me...

536
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,648
and he's struck by lightning...

537
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,571
ends up in a coma, typical.

538
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,403
Well, maybe he's dreaming about you.

539
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,969
Actually, there's conflicting cases...

540
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,453
about whether coma
patients can in fact dream

541
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:50,393
normally, or they're
more like hallucinating.

542
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,965
Thank you.

543
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,925
Sara.

544
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,925
Sara, I know you're listening. Answer me.

545
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,890
This is very simple, Sara.

546
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,243
I know you and your new friends
have the Mirakuru.

547
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,246
You know I will lay waste
to this entire island to get it.

548
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,967
- Get Slade.
- But it doesn't have to be that way.

549
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,083
All I want is the serum.

550
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,370
In exchange, I'll promise you and your friends
safe passage off this island, I promise.

551
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,805
Within 10 days, you and your new friends
could be making port in Shanghai.

552
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,965
The alternative is I send my men
into the jungle to take the serum from you.

553
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,401
They'll be under orders
not to kill any of you.

554
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,884
Instead, you'll remain alive enough
for me to indulge my, um...

555
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,765
scientific curiosity.

556
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,288
Think about it, Sara.

557
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,124
He's gone.

558
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,902
What?

559
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:03,631
Slade's gone. And he took
the Mirakuru with him.

560
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,201
You can ask all the questions you want, but
I wouldn't count on getting anything back.

561
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,522
She probably won't even know you're there.

562
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,006
I'll be down the hall if you need anything.

563
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,606
Maya.

564
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,921
I'm here to talk about your nephew.

565
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,644
Maya, my name is Laurel Lance.

566
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,009
Maya, I'm here to talk about your nephew.

567
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,610
Maya?

568
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,286
Maya, Que chico?

569
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,120
Que chico, Sebastian?

570
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,329
Sebastian.

571
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,966
Yes, yes.

572
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,201
Sebastian Blood.

573
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,842
There will always be those who seek
to harm us, but it will not weaken us.

574
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,923
It will only make us stronger.

575
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,482
Well done, alderman.

576
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,205
Thanks to you.

577
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,886
It was still a very big risk to take.

578
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,684
Heh.

579
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,767
Tonight, we both stood
up for Starling City.

580
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,409
You and me...

581
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,887
we can save this city...

582
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,840
if we work together.

583
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,441
Maya, can you talk to me about Sebastian?

584
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,041
It's okay, you can trust me, it's okay.

585
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,609
Sebastian's my friend.

586
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,643
Sebastian is the devil.

587
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,811
He's the one who put me here.

588
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,765
He made everybody think I'm insane.

589
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,566
But why would he do that?

590
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,482
He killed his father.

591
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,087
And I was there.

592
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,888
I saw it.

593
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,450
What?

594
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,883
Oh, my God.

595
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,965
Sebastian isn't your nephew.

596
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,769
He's your son.

597
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,570
Don't trust what he says.

598
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,966
You can't trust Sebastian Blood.
