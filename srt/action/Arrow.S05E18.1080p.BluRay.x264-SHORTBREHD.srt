1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,466
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,926
You kill because you like it.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,590
That's not true, Anatoly.

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,134
Someday it's going to fall apart.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,429
<i>And when it does, you're not going to
like the man you see underneath.</i>

6
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,313
- Don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,440
<i>It helped me discover who I am.</i>

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,772
That's what I'm going to
help you do, Oliver.

9
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,939
You don't kill because you have to.
So, why...

10
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,822
I wanted to!

11
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,858
And I liked it!

12
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,744
We're gonna get this son of a bitch
for whatever he did to you.

13
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,655
I don't wanna do this anymore.

14
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,448
I'm shutting everything down.

15
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,802
Oliver, what happened?

16
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,305
Yeah, and what did you mean
by "shutting this all down"?

17
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,468
Oliver, I really think that you should be
checked out by an actual doctor.

18
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:55,310
The only thing I need is
for all of you to go home.

19
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,143
Oliver, we're not going anywhere.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,481
Not a suggestion, John.

21
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,656
Don't you think
you at least owe us an explanation?

22
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,405
The explanation is simple.

23
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,532
Chase is right.

24
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:14,329
Everyone that is down here, around me,

25
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,666
well, they either suffer or they die.

26
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,456
Oliver, I can't imagine
what you've just been put through,

27
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,000
but you have to know that Chase is wrong.

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,010
I don't think that he is and I can't...

29
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,472
Would you just go, please?

30
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,937
Can the two of you give us the room?

31
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,242
It's just you and me now, Oliver.

32
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,752
Now, you don't have to
talk to me if you don't want to,

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,537
but I don't think you should be alone.

34
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,547
I think I should.

35
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,215
John, I want you to leave.

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,562
<i>RENE". He said all that?</i>

37
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,107
I've never seen him so broken.
And I've seen him at his lowest.

38
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,570
Did he say what Chase did to him?

39
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,734
Nope. Don't wanna know!

40
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,323
I already have
more than enough nightmare fuel

41
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,988
from this job to last me a while. So...

42
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,327
Let's back up a second.

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,993
He said the team's over?

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,584
Like, we're supposed to just sit back
and let Chase run wild?

45
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,589
Nobody's sitting around, Rene.

46
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,376
Look, Oliver's in a bad place right now,
but he will get it together.

47
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,465
I don't have to remind any of you
how strong he is.

48
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,130
- What did Thea say?
- She agreed.

49
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,765
He just needs time to get his head right.

50
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,892
She said she'll contact him
once we update her.

51
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,349
I don't know,
this time it just seems different.

52
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,981
He will bounce back, Felicity. He will.

53
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,564
Until then,
we are this city's last line of defense.

54
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,774
'Cept, our gear is back at the bunker.

55
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,110
And Oliver reprogrammed
all the security protocols.

56
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,694
Lyla will loan us gear from A.R.G.U.S.

57
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,450
And what about Chase?
He's still out there.

58
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,952
<i>We just have to remain alert.</i>

59
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,455
We're not just the anti-Prometheus team.

60
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,456
There are a lot of people in this city
who need saving.

61
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,958
I'm on Chase.

62
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,619
You guys just focus on
protecting the city.

63
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,294
Feel free to use my apartment
as your new secret lair.

64
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,170
Where is she going?

65
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,461
No place good.

66
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:39,145
Well, City Council bought my story
about your spiritual retreat.

67
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,772
It turns out Councilwoman Pollard
is a big fan of all that stuff.

68
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,150
You know, the woo-woo zen stuff.

69
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,772
Look, I'm not asking
what he did to you, all right?

70
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,817
All I gotta know is
what we're gonna do to him.

71
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,329
I mean, nothing. It's over.

72
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,330
Well, how'd you figure that?

73
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,241
Chase doesn't give up easy.

74
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,410
He doesn't need to do anything.

75
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,204
He's already won.

76
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,669
Mr. Mayor, your 11:00 is here.

77
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,720
Thank you for your compassion in
granting me bereavement leave, Mr. Mayor.

78
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,427
Doris' death has been very difficult.

79
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,346
Yeah, well maybe you shouldn't have
killed her then.

80
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,606
I'd like to speak to the Mayor
in private, please.

81
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,766
It's not gonna happen.

82
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,310
Quentin, please, just...

83
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,693
What are you doing here?

84
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,621
You won. It's over.

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,874
What did I ever say
that gave you that impression?

86
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,715
What are you doing?

87
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,878
Proving a point. Soto speak.

88
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,841
You think I'm gonna stab
the district attorney

89
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,304
in the middle of City Hall?

90
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,060
You're an animal who enjoys murder.

91
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,516
There's no telling what you'll do.

92
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,023
And it's not like
your alter ego can kill me,

93
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,560
not since the SCPD
put me in protective custody

94
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,320
since the Green Arrow slaughtered my wife.

95
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,981
So, you kill me in broad daylight,

96
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,903
or you let me live
knowing that there's nothing you can do.

97
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,996
Disappointing.

98
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,420
You can keep that knife.

99
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,978
Idea of returning to Lian Yu
makes me weep like tiny baby,

100
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,267
but Oliver Queen, he plan vacation there!

101
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,310
It's not a vacation, Anatoly.

102
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,479
People are gonna wanna know
where I've been

103
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,774
for the past, nearly, five years.

104
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,692
Lian Yu is the simplest answer.

105
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,782
It's good to see you
thinking about the future.

106
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,322
Only wish I had more time to spend
with this Oliver Queen.

107
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,956
You have 48 hours.

108
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,992
I know just how to spend them.

109
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:11,959
In old days, Bratva used to work
on behalf of Russian people.

110
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,547
Then selfish leaders like Gregor
corrupted our cause.

111
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,633
So the new Pakhan wants to bring
the Bratva back to its roots.

112
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,468
And new Pakhan needs your help.

113
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,051
I fear I cannot rebuild brotherhood
without you, Oliver.

114
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,972
Like I said, you have 48 hours.

115
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
Hey, I finished that worm.

116
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,811
I would've been a lot faster

117
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,276
if I knew what kind of system I was
embedding a backdoor into but...

118
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,440
Your timing is perfect.

119
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,608
I just finished the compilation.

120
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,654
This is all that we found on your target
from all available video sources,

121
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,039
cell phones, traffic cams,
security footage...

122
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,825
Please promise me you're never gonna make
a Felicity version of this.

123
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,666
The world doesn't need to know
how often I'm at the wine shop.

124
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,707
I guess it's too much to hope that
Chase took off his mask on camera.

125
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,874
Actually he did.

126
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,840
Yeah, I figured he wouldn't. Wait, what?

127
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,256
Why is his face all pixelated?

128
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,924
We're assuming
the use of optic scrambling.

129
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,092
He's got tech that prevents
a camera from capturing his image?

130
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,684
Like those scarves that celebrities use
to frustrate paparazzi.

131
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,893
But here's the thing.

132
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,524
If he's using a piece of tech

133
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,901
- we can reverse-engineer it.
- We can reverse-engineer it.

134
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,734
If we can produce video
that Chase is Prometheus,

135
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,022
that's game over for him.

136
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,190
Let's get started.

137
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,659
<i>He'!-</i>

138
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,787
They told me you were back.

139
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,623
- I had to see you.
- Hey.

140
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,163
Oh, I'm so sorry.

141
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,377
This wasn't you, Oliver. It was him.

142
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,917
Well, I... I created him.

143
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,214
And I know that that might sound weird,

144
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,387
but, uh, this happened to you
because of me.

145
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,553
Don't let him do this to you.
Don't let that bastard inside your head.

146
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,517
Okay.

147
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,565
I gave the police a statement about him.

148
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:03,200
They didn't believe you because
he probably had an ironclad alibi, right?

149
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,531
Yes, but if you corroborate my statement...

150
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,741
I can't.

151
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,247
I know it would probably mean
outing yourself as the Green Arrow...

152
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,623
It has nothing to do with that.

153
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,877
It has to do with the fact that
Chase would have planned for that

154
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,083
just like he has planned
for everything else.

155
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:20,626
My only chance is, well, I have to
do something that he hasn't planned for.

156
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,510
Like what?

157
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,599
Listen, Susan, I know that

158
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,765
we never got a chance to resolve things.

159
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,225
I can't be with you.
My apologies if that's presumptuous.

160
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,393
Oliver...

161
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,358
This is not how...

162
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:47,410
This is not how I wanted
my life to touch yours.

163
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,995
I should've known better.

164
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,333
And for that I really, truly am sorry.

165
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,264
Thank you for being here
on such short notice.

166
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,312
I understand that after last time,
I have run out of favors,

167
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,490
but this is an impossible situation.

168
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,995
And you're my only option.

169
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:41,215
Obviously. Last time, you made very clear
you did not want Bratva in city.

170
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,794
Circumstances have changed.

171
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,261
I need you to kill Adrian Chase.

172
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,177
<i>ANATOLY". Interesting.</i>

173
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,348
I never thought
you would give up The Hood.

174
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,893
Well, you were the one who told me
it was silly to think that a...

175
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,690
A piece of cloth could contain
the monster inside of me forever.

176
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,984
You were right.

177
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,408
Such a burden, always being right.

178
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,702
Life has no secrets.

179
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,367
I should've listened to you back then.

180
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,628
Least now you see self clearly.

181
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,040
Man must know who he is
in order to be happy.

182
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,459
Do you think I deserve to be happy?

183
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,878
Why not? I am happy.

184
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,386
My old friend has
finally remembered his oath,

185
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,222
and is about to
make his brothers very rich.

186
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,601
You should be happy, too.

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,263
I just want to see
Adrian Chase in the ground.

188
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,353
You'll be pleased to know
I've got only the best men with me.

189
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,360
I'll get you Chase's schedule
and known locations.

190
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,401
There is only small matter
of my down payment.

191
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,569
There's no down payment, Anatoly.

192
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,954
I want Chase dead immediately.

193
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:59,414
After last time,
I need small gesture of goodwill.

194
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,419
So my men can see that you are serious.

195
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,751
It's how you Americans say,
"Let's make deal."

196
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,631
You said that your fee has two parts, yes?

197
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,006
I will make sure
that you acquire the first tonight.

198
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,797
You get the second
when you take Chase out.

199
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,804
See? I knew we could both be reasonable.

200
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,014
Let's toast.

201
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,100
Please tell me
you did not put away the vodka.

202
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,685
Adrian Chase, winter is here.

203
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,103
It's spring.

204
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,864
We're gonna talk about you not watching
Game of Thrones, but first, look at this.

205
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,776
The pixelation pattern was consistent
with that of an optics scrambler

206
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,036
that Kord Industries
is planning on bringing to market

207
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,742
- in the next six months.
- How does it work?

208
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,952
It interferes with the camera's

209
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,661
- digital conversion circuit.
- That's good!

210
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,121
That means we can use an algorithm

211
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,457
to remove the distortion
from the existing image.

212
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,544
Yes, but to do that, I would need
physical access to Chase's scrambler.

213
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,629
I'm sure he'd be happy to help.

214
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,010
Sounds like a super accommodating guy.

215
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,172
Great.

216
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,099
I've seen more firepower
in the stands at a Dogs game.

217
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,182
Lyla could only authorize hardware
that wouldn't be missed.

218
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,597
Hey, have you heard from Felicity?

219
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,686
It'd be nice for her to have
our backs when we hit the streets.

220
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,350
Radio silence since she left for Helix,

221
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,985
but without our comms,
I'm not sure she'd be much help.

222
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,646
We have these.

223
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,280
Uh...

224
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,279
We have a break-in
at the two medical research laboratories.

225
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,492
Let's move out.

226
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,249
Talk to me, Curtis.

227
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,910
<i>Without the infrared
from our body cams,</i>

228
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,454
<i>we won't be able to pull heat signatures.</i>

229
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,169
So we won't really know
how many hostiles we're up against.

230
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,675
Also, this mask is
really making my face itch.

231
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,094
Perimeter sweep is two
tangoes at the back entrance. No others.

232
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,854
I know we don't have
our tranq ammo,

233
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,016
but I need this done
as clean and bloodless as possible.

234
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,684
Not a problem.

235
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,702
I'm all for blood,
but look at the label on those crates.

236
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,534
Oplimid. That's a diabetes drug.

237
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,790
Back entrance is clear.

238
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,801
Spartan and Wild Dog moving in.

239
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,509
Hands up. Hands up. Hands up.
Hands up. Hands up.

240
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,349
He doesn't like repeating himself.

241
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,977
Sounds like Russian!

242
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,104
<i>Look, this one's accent
has not improved.</i>

243
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:30,943
Still sounds horrible.

244
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,103
Anatoly?

245
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,317
<i>John Diggle.</i>

246
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,651
My favorite American.

247
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,737
- We know this guy?
<i>- What</i> the <i>hell</i> are you <i>doing</i>

248
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,526
- in Star <i>City?</i>
- Isn't it obvious?

249
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,621
Anatoly, I can't let you
steal these drugs.

250
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,997
Is not matter of "let."

251
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,409
I have invitation to be here.

252
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,918
Invitation from who?

253
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,253
Oliver, you brought Anatoly Knyazev
to Star City?

254
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,417
Yes. I did.

255
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:58,964
And he just told me that his operation
was nearly compromised by my team.

256
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,053
I said that's impossible.

257
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,683
- The team no longer exists.
- The hell it doesn't!

258
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,437
When I told you to stand down, I meant it.

259
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,348
Anatoly is here for a reason.

260
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,515
To steal drugs.

261
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,435
I had to give him that
to get what I wanted.

262
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,776
He's here to kill Adrian Chase.

263
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,323
Oliver,

264
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:27,000
we don't hire criminals,
and pay them with diabetes drugs.

265
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,626
Chase has killed innocent people

266
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,085
in this whole sick game
he's been playing, trying to get to me.

267
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,126
Star City will not be safe
until he is in the ground.

268
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,636
And there is no price I will not pay
to see that happen.

269
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,469
- Even selling your soul?
- Better my soul than yours.

270
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,056
Or Felicity's or Curtis'
or anyone on the team.

271
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:50,975
So you got Anatoly to kill Chase
so we wouldn't have to.

272
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,517
I created Prometheus, John.

273
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,778
I created this whole thing.

274
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,441
Chase's death should be on my conscience.

275
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,200
Not yours.

276
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,366
What the hell did Chase do to you, man,

277
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,749
to convince you to think that
any of this is okay?

278
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,033
This is a mistake, Oliver.

279
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,544
A mistake that
you will not be able to come back from.

280
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,954
And I'm not gonna let you make it.

281
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,795
Well, I'm not gonna let you get hurt.

282
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,256
So here we are.

283
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,176
Felicity was right.

284
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,387
<i>Prometheus trying to convince you that</i>

285
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,554
you are responsible for everything bad
that's happened to people.

286
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,313
Oliver, I swear,
that's just a bunch of crap.

287
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,566
Tell that to Laurel.

288
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,897
Tell that to Tommy.

289
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,357
Tell that to my mother.

290
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,443
Tell that to Billy Malone.

291
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,027
I mean, you can tell it to Thea.

292
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,569
She's so damaged
that she had to leave town.

293
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,238
This is not post-traumatic stress, John.

294
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,705
This is a truth that I was
keeping myself from seeing

295
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,414
and I'm no longer doing that.

296
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,339
Anatoly and his men
will kill Adrian Chase.

297
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,794
That is the solution.

298
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,545
The team is done,

299
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:07,183
so I'm telling you,
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you

300
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,561
for the last time, stand down.

301
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,749
- I don't believe it.
- Really?

302
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,502
I mean, Oliver can't go after Chase
himself, so he finds guys who can.

303
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,664
He let them steal from a company
that was barely hanging on.

304
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,332
Oliver put hundreds of jobs on the line

305
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,968
and I know he knows that,
'cause I was in the same briefing.

306
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,720
Yeah, speaking of which,
why haven't you gone back into City Hall?

307
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,473
Because Lance banned him
until Chase is taken off the board.

308
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,852
Something to do with Rene threatening
to pop a cap in his ass.

309
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,017
What about breaking up the team?

310
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,858
Prometheus is in Oliver's head, Curtis,
like I've never seen before.

311
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,777
Hey, can we talk in private?

312
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,279
Um... Yeah.

313
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,739
Yeah.

314
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,136
<i>He'!-</i>

315
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,428
You and I need to
talk some sense into Oliver

316
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,139
before he does something
that he's gonna regret.

317
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,302
I'm not stopping you.

318
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,063
Well, Felicity, I know you're
full throttle with this Helix,

319
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,644
but it has to be the both of us.

320
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:38,854
We have to present a united front,

321
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,484
so we have the best chance
of getting through to him.

322
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,815
Well, maybe we shouldn't.

323
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:42,979
What do you mean?

324
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,362
The team has been after Chase for months,

325
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,774
and he's always been one step ahead of us.

326
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,990
If Oliver thinks that the Bratva is
our best chance at getting to him,

327
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,200
then maybe we should stay out of his way.

328
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,205
And when chemicals
from both medicines bind,

329
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,124
it creates powerful opioid.

330
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,089
It's more addictive than heroin.

331
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,596
It's just what the world needs.

332
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,809
Revenue is what Bratva needs.

333
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,638
It's gotten bad, Oliver.

334
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,351
I'm under much pressure.

335
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,109
This drug will help secure my position
as Pakhan.

336
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,855
So that's why you need the medicine,

337
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,900
to manufacture a street drug?

338
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,363
Shouldn't be here, John.

339
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,073
Should've known Curtis would
hack the locks, Oliver.

340
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,991
I didn't think I could be
more disappointed, I guess I was wrong.

341
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,209
I'll let you have room.

342
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,385
I'm not gonna keep having
the same conversation.

343
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:52,344
That's too bad 'cause I dedicated
five years of my life to your crusade.

344
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:57,057
So I'm the one that gets to say
if I need protecting. Not you.

345
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,813
I'm not gonna have your death
on my conscience.

346
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,690
Oliver, don't talk to me
about your conscience.

347
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,272
Not when you get back in bed
with the Bratva.

348
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,904
This isn't you, man.

349
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,366
<i>The Oliver I know would never let
a group of dangerous criminals</i>

350
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,246
crawl into his city,
let them steal medicine.

351
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,033
You don't know what kind of man I am.

352
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,752
What?

353
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,414
What the hell did Chase do to you, Oliver?

354
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,834
Whatever it was, he messed with your head
in a way I didn't think was possible.

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,423
Look at me, man. I can help you.

356
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,633
I'm your brother.

357
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,343
You don't want me as a brother.

358
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,553
What does that mean?

359
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,969
Chase showed me the truth about myself.

360
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:44,734
You signed on for a crusade
that turned out to be an outlet.

361
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,651
It was an excuse for me to murder people.

362
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,691
- Oliver, please.
- I put on a hood

363
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,280
and I created a persona because, John,

364
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,539
somewhere along the way,
something in me broke.

365
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,748
Something is sick inside of me.

366
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:08,212
The crusade, all of this,
the foundation of it, is a lie.

367
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,342
<i>So I disbanded the team</i>

368
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,799
because I won't sit by

369
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:18,389
and watch all of you
participate in my murder spree.

370
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,350
I am beyond redemption.

371
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,652
You and the team will be fine
if you stay away from me,

372
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,814
you stay away from this,
you stay away from Chase,

373
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,325
and you allow the Bratva to do their job.

374
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,500
Let my crusade die.

375
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,355
That kid won't last a month.

376
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,561
- He had tuberculosis?
- Mmm.

377
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,601
The disease comes from prison.

378
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,111
Super-resistant strain.

379
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,692
What? I mean, is it in any way treatable?

380
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,983
Yeah, with right medicine, yes,

381
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,744
but even Bratva cannot buy for them,
not in quantities needed.

382
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,530
All we can do is pay for funerals.

383
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,575
Anatoly, is this how we're planning on
spending my last two days in Russia?

384
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,119
I thought, what better way
to cap off your time here

385
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,879
than good old-fashioned heist?

386
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:41,058
If Diggle's the new Oliver, and I'm
obviously the new Felicity, don't hate,

387
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,015
which one of you guys is the new Diggle?

388
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,645
- I am.
- I am.

389
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,770
Seriously? You've been here,
like, what, 10 minutes?

390
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,651
You don't even have a codename!

391
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,313
Fine. You're the new Digg.

392
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,071
The fact that she was not petty and...

393
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,077
I mean, that's extremely Digg-like.

394
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,204
- You see that, right? She's...
- Yeah, okay, you're the new Digg.

395
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,328
But as the only Rene Ramirez,

396
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,583
- I gotta ask...
- Oh, boy.

397
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,666
Shouldn't we be cool with
letting the Bratva kill Adrian Chase?

398
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,422
No, we shouldn't.

399
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,709
Look, guys,
if Oliver lets the Bratva kill Chase,

400
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,593
he's just going right back
into his old habits.

401
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,425
And he's willing to
make that sacrifice right now,

402
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,760
but, I think,
once Oliver's thinking clearly,

403
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,516
he's gonna regret this.

404
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,645
So we're just supposed to let Chase
live to kill another day?

405
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,101
No, we're gonna bring Chase to justice.
The right way.

406
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,105
This isn't about saving Chase,
it's about saving Oliver's soul.

407
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,488
Curtis, the hack you put on the DA's
office just pulled up Chase's schedule.

408
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,779
He's about to leave City Hall.

409
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,073
Trip to the safe house
SCPD's keeping Chase in

410
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,458
is the perfect time
for the Russians to do their thing.

411
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,617
Can't let the Bratva get a hold of Chase.

412
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,785
I can pull up his route remotely.

413
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,124
<i>And I saw something on Felicity's computer</i>

414
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,288
<i>that might help us get Chase.</i>

415
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,922
Good. Do that. Let's suit up.

416
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,379
"Suit up"? Wait, we don't have suits...

417
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,670
You meant figuratively. Suit up...

418
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,008
Suit up, like...

419
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,764
We're still in the lair, suit up, like,
but we're not in the lair.

420
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,300
But did you see what I'm saying?

421
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,438
Quite an escort.

422
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,313
Green Arrow could be anywhere.

423
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,647
Who do you think is under that hood?

424
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,733
The department has gotta have a theory.

425
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,820
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

426
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,660
Make sure that Kevlar stays on.

427
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,779
Go! Run!

428
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,032
Hey! Why interfere?

429
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,700
You want Chase dead, yes?

430
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,868
Yes, but not like this.

431
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,213
Mr. Holt.

432
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,381
How's that husband of yours?

433
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,095
Mr. Chase!
- I'm over here!

434
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,223
- Mr. Chase!
- I'm over here!

435
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,184
The hitters are retreating.
Are you all right?

436
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,820
I'm fine. I'm fine.

437
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,740
- Rene and Diggle?
- Driving off Anatoly's men.

438
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,700
Did you get it?

439
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,915
I got it.

440
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,075
Good man.

441
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,384
It's clear the attack occurred

442
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,046
after details of the DA's schedule
were compromised.

443
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,213
A leak?

444
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,677
<i>AGENT". Until we can confirm the source,</i>

445
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,719
<i>DA Chase will be transferred into
the Federal Witness Protection Program.</i>

446
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,932
No Star City employee
will have access to his file.

447
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,769
I'm really not sure
all of this is necessary.

448
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:20,528
Adrian, please, your safety is of
paramount importance to this office.

449
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,566
Do it.

450
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,829
You actually tried something.

451
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,581
Consider me impressed.

452
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,868
This isn't over.

453
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,598
Chase is being transferred into
federal protection,

454
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,680
which means that
the Bratva can't get to him.

455
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:52,843
You're welcome.

456
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,316
Feel better?

457
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:00,980
No.

458
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,812
We're not done, Oliver.

459
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,903
You and me, we're never gonna be done.

460
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,534
Do you understand that?

461
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,912
Listen, man, you can tell me
that you're a serial killer,

462
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:16,497
that you're crazy or you're whatever
Chase has shoved into your head,

463
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,002
but I'm not believing any of that,
even if you do.

464
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,710
And that's because
I know the kind of man you are, Oliver.

465
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,624
The good, the bad, and the ugly.

466
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,043
I know.

467
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:30,807
And you don't need to punish yourself
or isolate yourself,

468
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:35,011
but what you need to do
is stop pushing me away

469
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,726
because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!

470
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:38,980
Do you get that?

471
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,608
What do you want me to do, John?

472
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,109
I've told you what I am, who I am,

473
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,150
and even if you don't believe it, I do.

474
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,527
I do.

475
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,118
So I don't know where that leaves us.

476
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,715
It leaves us right back
at Langham, Oliver.

477
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,922
You remember that?

478
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,264
It killed my brother, Oliver,

479
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,857
and I was going to let myself
rot in prison for what I did.

480
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,903
But you told me to atone
for what I did as Spartan.

481
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:31,568
<i>And if that's true for me,
it is 100 times truer for the Green Arrow.</i>

482
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,408
You don't get to
just walk away from this, man.

483
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,994
The Hood is who you are.

484
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,080
You don't think you deserve it? Fine.

485
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,874
Work to become the man who does.

486
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,248
I don't know how.

487
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,428
You just ask for help.

488
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,761
You don't have to do this alone, Oliver.

489
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,104
I have an idea.

490
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,560
We hack WITSEC.

491
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,441
Can we find out
what town Chase is going into,

492
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,774
and then we get hired as waitresses
at the inevitably folksy diner,

493
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,610
we drug his coffee,
we steal his scrambler.

494
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,570
Mmm. You know how I know I'm exhausted?

495
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,451
That plan actually sounds plausible.

496
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,987
Free pie. For life.

497
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,575
- That's all I'm saying. Free pie.
- Mmm-hmm.

498
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:18,830
- Felicity.
- Yeah.

499
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,115
Do you know this guy?

500
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,283
Curtis?

501
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,043
- You told him about our operation?
- No.

502
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,708
I turn off the GPS on my phone.
How did you...

503
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,465
You son of a bitch. Those damn...

504
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:32,379
Tracking nanites, yup. Blueberries weren't
the only surprise in those pancakes.

505
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,636
I knew they were funky.

506
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,796
Um, can we talk in private?

507
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,715
- Uh, no.
- Fine.

508
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,510
Then you don't get to ask me
any questions about how I got this.

509
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,145
- Is that...
- Chase's optics scrambler? Sure is.

510
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,351
How did you know we were looking for it?

511
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,811
I might've taken a peek
at your IRC window.

512
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,319
I guess you can say
that I hacked the hackers. Wow!

513
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,613
- What?
- The pixelation algorithm, is encrypted,

514
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,995
I should've known it would be encrypted,
but it's encrypted.

515
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,996
Well, how long will it take you
to break the encryption?

516
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,578
If my math is right. 3.6, 10 to the 18th,

517
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,211
e to the six, seventy-five turf locks,
13 months.

518
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,168
Well, I know someone
who can break it faster.

519
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,798
Kord Industries.

520
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,755
I mean, they set the encryption,
they can break it.

521
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,342
I don't think that Kord
is gonna help us hack their stolen tech.

522
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,097
And that's why you'll have to break in.

523
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,183
Shouldn't be so hard
for Overwatch and Mr. Terrific,

524
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,844
who could pull off a heist at Kord.

525
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,513
You told them about our operation?

526
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,808
- I didn't. How did you...
- Come on, Felicity,

527
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,066
you really think we didn't know?

528
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,602
It took me eight minutes,
three for this guy.

529
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,020
These hackers are mean.

530
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,563
Well, deal with it.

531
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,697
We have to deal with this.

532
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,454
Thanks for meeting.

533
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,416
I am only here for you to explain

534
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,794
why team you disbanded
keeps interfering with business.

535
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,082
Because they don't give up,

536
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,545
and they convinced me not to.

537
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,888
Anatoly, I'm sorry, but you need to
tell your men to stand down.

538
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,047
Our deal is off.

539
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,757
No.

540
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,141
Excuse me?

541
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,896
You want Chase to keep breathing, fine,

542
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,183
but I'm not leaving Star City
until I get what I came for.

543
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,024
You know as well as I do,
once there is deal, it is forever.

544
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,234
I understand how the Bratva works. I...

545
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,115
lam asking you this as a friend.

546
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,368
Yes. And I am telling, as friend,

547
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,370
if you interfere with my operation,

548
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,033
no favor exists that can repair break
between you and I.

549
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,503
You either Bratva brother,
or you Bratva enemy.

550
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,638
We are in position.

551
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,925
<i>I'll meet you by the side entrance.</i>

552
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,998
The Bratva aren't backing down,

553
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,538
which means I have to stop them.

554
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,462
John has convinced me not to do it alone.

555
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,302
I wanted to shut all of this down
because I was afraid.

556
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,932
I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase

557
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,937
would corrupt you more than...

558
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,894
More than I already have.

559
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,979
To me, the...

560
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,735
The Bratva was the best option,

561
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,989
but John insists that as a team,

562
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,900
we can find another way
to bring Chase to justice.

563
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,863
<i>You've put your faith in me
and I'm putting my faith in you now</i>

564
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,781
because once...

565
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,121
Once we handle the Bratva, I'd...

566
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,960
I need your help to prove that
John is right and Chase is wrong.

567
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,752
Should be easy considering Prometheus
is all the way wrong, hoss.

568
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,888
I think what Rene is trying to say is that

569
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,674
it's not all on your shoulders.

570
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,014
<i>We're here for you, Oliver.</i>

571
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,517
Okay.

572
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,354
Suit up.

573
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,702
Alarms haven't been triggered all night.

574
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,291
No break-ins.

575
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,876
Yeah, except us.

576
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,257
Anatoly needs Revlextra
to manufacture his drug.

577
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,793
The Bratva will definitely be here.

578
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,633
Spartan's right.
Anatoly won't back off now.

579
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,593
They could be anywhere,
this place is huge.

580
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,304
Felicity and Curtis
picked a hell of a night to take off.

581
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,360
Okay, I'm in.

582
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,244
CCTV is compromised.

583
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,241
Got anything?

584
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,498
West wing is clear.

585
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,952
So's the East.

586
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,716
I was hoping
I wouldn't have to punch anybody.

587
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,435
All right, I just got a sentry.
They can't be far.

588
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,690
<i>They're not.</i>

589
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,235
Better get over here. Fast.

590
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,398
NO.

591
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,783
That worked.

592
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,463
You can't win.

593
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,974
Is that you behind mask?

594
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,304
What happened to hood?

595
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,969
It's over, Anatoly.

596
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,478
Leave the medicine and go.

597
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,390
I had feeling you would say this.

598
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,355
So I prepared insurance plan.

599
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,499
You have chosen
where you stand with Bratva.

600
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,538
<i>Now you must make one more choice.</i>

601
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:45,797
Save pills or save hostages?

602
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,380
Spartan, Wild Dog, get the hostages.

603
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,968
I'll handle the Bratva.

604
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,845
Kill them.

605
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,885
In Russia, you would have killed him.

606
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,969
And you would've stopped him.

607
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,055
Looks like we're not in Russia anymore.

608
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,898
You all right?

609
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,161
Curtis didn't leave us completely hanging.

610
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,795
Hand me your tablet.

611
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,087
You brought the scrambler here?

612
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,098
I wasn't gonna wait to see
if we could break the encryption.

613
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,266
Go ahead, Oliver.

614
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,519
You want to kill old life?

615
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,572
Start by killing me.

616
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,991
Very stupid. Now you have to run.

617
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,201
So do you.

618
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,679
- Did you get it?
- Oh, yeah.

619
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
<i>That is what we needed.</i>

620
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,981
Something that he couldn't plan for.

621
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,645
You.

622
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,816
Please let me be the one
to walk this into SCPD.

623
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:14,983
Knock yourself out.

624
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,527
Yeah, and then I'm gonna
throw it up on YouTube.

625
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,445
There won't be anywhere
that son of a bitch can run.

626
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,534
Does this mean that
we're officially back in business?

627
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,629
Aside from a few minor changes, yeah.

628
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,464
New lineup could use
a little more green, hoss.

629
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,632
I'm not quite there yet.

630
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,682
I'm thinking that
with this team behind me,

631
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,518
it'll be sooner rather than later.

632
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,699
How does it feel to be Robin Hood?

633
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,361
Hmm, you tell me.
You're the one with bow and arrow.

634
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,531
I know I said that
Russia's not good for you...

635
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,201
But you thought that this heist,
and helping these people

636
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,495
would convince me
to change my mind about leaving.

637
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,964
<i>Da.</i> Like I said, I need your help.

638
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,295
Russia is your home, Anatoly.

639
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,381
Let me go save mine.

640
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,886
You can do this without me.

641
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,639
I'm not worried about
what Bratva would become without you.

642
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,510
I worry about what I become.

643
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,055
But more important question,

644
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:31,102
how drunk can we get
before dropping you off at Lian Yu?

645
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,695
You have two minutes.

646
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,575
Then I'm calling the SCPD.

647
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,658
Oliver Queen, afraid to be alone
with Bratva gangster?

648
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:43,868
How far you have fallen.

649
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,078
Anatoly, you didn't bring me here
to insult me.

650
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,959
No. I give you friendly tip.

651
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,119
I go back to Russia tonight,

652
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,835
but leave Star City a little present.

653
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,089
My best men.

654
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,250
Your best men were arrested.

655
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,176
Already out on bail.

656
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,761
I hear they cannot wait to get revenge
on vigilantes that put them away.

657
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:05,973
This is between you and me, no one else.

658
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,261
"No one else"?

659
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,932
You betrayed every man in Bratva.

660
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,318
You betrayed Russian community.

661
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,194
You even work against own team!

662
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,324
I see this, I think,
I still trust him anyway.

663
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,442
What a fool I was.

664
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,532
No. I'm the fool.

665
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,534
Because I thought that our friendship,
everything we have been through together,

666
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,543
actually meant something to you.

667
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,831
The person that I knew
would never betray a friend,

668
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,342
would never threaten innocent people.

669
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,964
Over what?

670
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,462
A payday-

671
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,263
When I left Russia, I was convinced
that you could lead the Bratva,

672
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,600
that you could set them on a better path.

673
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,683
And now look at you.

674
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,356
You're no better than Gregor.

675
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,235
I told you.

676
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,992
I was worried about what I would become
without your help.

677
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:09,788
I did what I had to do
to keep Bratva together.

678
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,997
And to stay alive.

679
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,580
I became what I had to become.

680
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,297
You ask why I changed?

681
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,341
That is it.

682
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,845
This video has been authenticated
by three different experts.

683
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,686
It hasn't been doctored or altered
in any way. That is raw footage.

684
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,188
Chase is in the protective custody
of the U.S. Marshals.

685
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,111
Yeah. Well somebody better give 'em a call

686
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,192
and place that son of a bitch
under arrest.
