1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,891
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,686
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,087
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,603
To save my city.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,929
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,170
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,728
I must be something else.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,290
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,365
There's a new player we've been
tracking. We're calling him Deathstroke.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,165
I have a proposal for you men.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,604
Roy was injected with the serum. He's
alive, but we have to keep an eye on him.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,768
- Stay away from Thea.
- No.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,645
She's not safe around you.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,644
You love her, and that's why
you're gonna do what I'm asking.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,003
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,961
I believed in you.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,130
As of 30 minutes ago,
your company belongs to me.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,522
Slade. You're working for him.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,247
I know Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,889
I don't think my
eye holes line up properly.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,044
- Is anyone else having this problem?
- Don't be nervous.

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,402
I'm a lot nervous.
This is a big move, even for us.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,177
And we've cornered the
market on big moves.

24
00:01:20,187 --> 00:01:21,504
Slade didn't give us any choice.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,041
Yeah, but as far as plans go,
this is not a good one.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,049
Felicity, this was your plan.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,368
I didn't think you'd actually say yes.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,370
We're here.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,727
Hey.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,485
That man used to work for me.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,682
And now he works for our enemy.

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,684
Security cameras are down.

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,804
You all remember the skeleton key...

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,480
courtesy of William Tockman,
a.k.a. The Clock King.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,121
It can open any lock, including this one.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,441
This is where we met Barry.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,761
These are plug-and-play.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,089
Fasten them where we talked about.
Let the C4 do the rest.

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,885
Been a while since
I've blown anything up.

40
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,910
Quick and clean.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,607
I'm a bomber.

42
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,000
I can't believe I'm a bomber.

43
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:42,550
I wonder if I can list it on my
resume under "special skills"?

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,165
Freeze.

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,724
We have to go.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,610
Thermal shows everybody's out.

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,844
It's just a building, Oliver.

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,804
Cowards. Who else would
needlessly destroy...

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,361
cutting-edge scientific
and medical technology...

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,731
whose sole purpose is to make Starling
City a healthier and safer place?

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,610
As CEO of Queen Consolidated...

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,964
I have a message to the terrorists
who committed this unspeakable act:

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,807
You will be caught and punished.

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,568
For the record, I hated her
before we found out she was a supervillain.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Okay, Slade's goal is to create an army
of human weapons using the Mirakuru.

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,650
To do that,
he needs an industrial centrifuge.

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,162
Which having Isabel Rochev steal
Queen Consolidated from your family...

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,443
- gave him full access to.
- Since Applied Sciences went kaboom...

59
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,207
he can't use our technology, formerly
ours, for his warped experiments.

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,200
Slade has had us on our heels for weeks.
It's about time we took the fight to him.

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,368
All this will do is set him back.

62
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,286
We have no way of knowing
where the next attack is coming from.

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,126
Look, you need to drop this, okay?
I'm fine, really.

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,044
How is any of this fine?

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,165
Look, you need to concentrate on you.
Now listen, are you going to your meetings?

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,081
Yes. It's where I talk about
how my father's facing prison.

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,169
Laurel...

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,843
this will all blow over, okay? Please.

69
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,929
No, it won't, Dad.

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,407
You were caught aiding
and abetting the vigilante.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,245
Working with him last year
cost you your detective shield.

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,442
Now it can cost you 18 months in prison.

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,683
They want his name.

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,962
Do you know who the Arrow is?

75
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,680
I don't.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,884
I swear.

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,163
Well, what about the woman in black?
The one the Arrow works with.

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,924
Do you know who she is?

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,404
- No.
- You must have some idea.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,650
Honey, I can't tell
you what I don't know.

81
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:34,675
Time's up.

82
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,769
You girls, you take care of each other.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,044
Do you really think he doesn't know
who the Arrow is?

84
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,887
It's not like Dad to lie.

85
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,766
Sometimes it's people closest to us
who lie to us best.

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,364
Where is Thea?
She should be here for this too.

87
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,444
- Yet I doubt she's coming.
- Well, I can't lie to either of you.

88
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,849
It's bad. If Isabel Rochev
is one thing, it's thorough.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,691
She's been laying the foundation
for this takeover for months.

90
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,070
But we still own a majority of stock
in the company, correct?

91
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,404
Yes, but Isabel has diluted that stock
to the point where it's worthless.

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,568
On paper, you're virtually broke.

93
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,610
And what's the good news?

94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,966
We can protect your assets.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,925
We need to move everything into a new trust
Isabel can't touch.

96
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,762
All I need is the beneficiaries from the
current trust to approve the transfer.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,764
The two of you and Thea.

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,044
- Thea needs to sign off?
- Yes, and quickly.

99
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,167
Thank you, Ned.

100
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,640
Well, now I have to become mayor.
It seems I'll need the income.

101
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,569
Losing the company wasn't your fault.

102
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,921
It was mine.

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,691
- I let Isabel Rochev get the better of me.
- No.

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,684
You always see the good in people
even if they don't deserve it.

105
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,211
I know that better than most.

106
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,925
Isabel is a vindictive woman.

107
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,441
She would've done this
with or without your trust.

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,721
How do you know?

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,002
You told me months ago
I couldn't trust her.

110
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,084
Your father had a weakness
for beautiful strong women.

111
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,361
They were together?

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,490
Yes.

113
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,561
She was still in business
school at the time.

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,685
The pretty intern that
caught the CEO's eye.

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,049
All right, you take this to Thea
and you convince her...

116
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,729
somehow, to help us fight back.

117
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,006
Will you help me up?

118
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,128
- Yeah.
- Uhn!

119
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,411
- Just to my trunk.
- Okay.

120
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,167
Ah. Look who's up.

121
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,964
Just in time for all the fun.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,244
- What are you gonna do to him?
- Make him scream.

123
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,330
Just like he made us. Hmm?

124
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,490
They say living well is best revenge. Heh.

125
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,369
I prefer torture.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,242
- You want first turn?
- No.

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,011
Please, I can help you.

128
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,124
No, doctor, I can help you.

129
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,245
What was it you said you needed
for research? An eye?

130
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,770
- No.
- Let me get you fresh one.

131
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,485
You can still stop Slade Wilson.

132
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,727
Anatoly.

133
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,884
Wait.

134
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,527
What did you say?

135
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,960
I can help you stop him.

136
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,488
How? That miracle drug of yours
has turned him into monster.

137
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,490
I know. I can turn him back.

138
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,886
Ivo, what are you saying?

139
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,202
The Mirakuru.

140
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,924
There's a cure.

141
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,046
Hey.

142
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,287
Is Thea here?

143
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,610
I haven't seen her.

144
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,730
- How's your dad?
- He's willing to go to jail for the Arrow.

145
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,323
I know you said you weren't worried,
but Dig and I went to Roy's apartment.

146
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,710
- It's empty.
- Seems like he cleared out a few days ago.

147
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,722
Where the hell did he go?

148
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,566
Roy will have to wait.

149
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,809
We need to deal with Slade,
figure out what his next move is.

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,284
I know Slade. He is not gonna stop until...

151
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,642
Welcome home.

152
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,531
Aah!

153
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,689
Hello, Sara.

154
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,287
Diggle, stay back.

155
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,688
You're wasting your bullets.

156
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,803
Don't forget who taught you
how to fight, kid.

157
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,043
Excuse me, I'm looking for
my sister, Sara Lance.

158
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,008
Excuse me, I'm Laurel Lance.
Is my sister okay?

159
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,807
Oh, she'll be fine. Just a hairline
fracture of her wrist. We set it.

160
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,646
She's got some nasty bruises.
Looks worse than it is.

161
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,887
Thank you.

162
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,050
Nothing compared to her previous injuries.

163
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,488
Previous injuries?

164
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,127
Yes, your sister has extensive scar tissue
over her entire body.

165
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,126
Last person I saw with that much damage
was a veteran injured in Iraq.

166
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,249
Has your sister served in the military?

167
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,128
No. No, she hasn't.

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,480
- Sara.
- Hi.

169
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,524
- What happened to you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

170
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,650
Ollie and I just had
a little motorcycle mishap. It was nothing.

171
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,441
- I already got my discharge papers.
- But your back...

172
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,724
Those scars, where did you get them?

173
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,130
- You okay?
- I will be.

174
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,800
- You?
- Yeah.

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,968
- Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,243
- So tell me what happened.
- Motorcycle accident. It was stupid.

177
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,966
We were making a left turn,
this car ran a red light.

178
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,964
Did you file a police report?

179
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,522
We didn't see the point. We're both fine.
That's what counts, right?

180
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,001
Right.
I should really go.

181
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,885
- I have a deposition in an hour.
- Okay.

182
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,368
Thanks for checking up on me.

183
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,884
Always.

184
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,851
I know Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

185
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,845
Hey.

186
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,568
We missed you yesterday.

187
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,766
The meeting with Ned Foster.

188
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,204
Thea, I know that you're mad
at Mom and me...

189
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,085
but we may have found a way
out of this financial mess.

190
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,567
We aren't gonna lose everything.

191
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,730
Mom and I both signed. We just...

192
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,404
We need your signature, and hopefully
we can stop Isabel from ruining us.

193
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,241
After you let her ruin us, you mean?

194
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,045
Yeah.

195
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,362
Says "Thea Queen" here. Who's she?

196
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,087
- It's you, Speedy.
- No, it's not.

197
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,489
Robert Queen wasn't my father.
Malcolm Merlyn was.

198
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,967
Thea Merlyn, kind of has a nice ring to it.

199
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,050
Merlyn was your biological father,
but Dad raised you.

200
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,163
Only because he didn't know I wasn't his.

201
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,204
Hey, hey, he...

202
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,688
He loved you.

203
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,329
- So do I. And I'm still your brother.
- No, you're not.

204
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,325
You're my half-brother.

205
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,370
You know who else
was my half-brother? Tommy.

206
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,331
Tommy who I tried to kiss.

207
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,922
I tried to kiss my half-brother...

208
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,970
before my real father killed him.

209
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,123
That's how screwed-up I am.

210
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,130
You know the sad part?

211
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,721
I was actually starting
to be in a good place.

212
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,008
I had the club.

213
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,682
I had Roy. I had a brother
who wasn't lying to me.

214
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,048
For the first time in my crazy life...

215
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,882
everything didn't seem so completely
and totally messed up.

216
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,605
I thought I was gonna be okay.

217
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,086
I'm so stupid.

218
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,881
- You're not stupid.
- No, what I am...

219
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,526
is a daughter of two mass murderers.

220
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,728
Not one, but two.

221
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,402
So let's face it, Ollie.

222
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,807
I was never gonna be okay.

223
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,525
It's not in my genes.

224
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,360
Thea...

225
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,641
Oliver...

226
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,286
we need to discuss
that security matter now.

227
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,723
- What do we have?
- What Slade took.

228
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,888
- "Took"?
- He wasn't here to kill us.

229
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,884
He was here because we had
something that he wanted.

230
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,246
The skeleton key.

231
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,880
I did a full sweep.
It's the only thing that's missing.

232
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,328
He needs a way to mass-produce the serum
now that we dusted Applied Sciences.

233
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,990
With the skeleton key, he can get
anywhere, take anything he wants.

234
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,083
We know what he wants.
We just need to find it first.

235
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,086
Where is the most cutting-edge
technology housed in Starling City?

236
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,208
The combined inventory of every scientist
who ever worked at S.T.A.R. Labs...

237
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,970
all housed right in here.

238
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,766
I hereby christen this building "the bomb."

239
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,490
- Nobody says that anymore.
- I say it.

240
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,364
I define my own cool.

241
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,770
I still can't believe Dr. Wells
is shutting this place down.

242
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,641
S.T.A.R. Labs blew a hole in Central City
when we turned the particle accelerator on.

243
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,770
It's not surprising that Starling City
canceled the lease on this facility.

244
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,888
We're not exactly the poster children for:

245
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,566
"Let us store our unregulated prototypes
in your neighborhood."

246
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,000
It was an accident, Caitlin.

247
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,750
Yeah, well try telling that to
the families of people who died.

248
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,651
Maybe you can figure out
how to tell that to yourself.

249
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,286
Look, Cisco, let's get this inventory done
so we can go home.

250
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,127
I thought we were the only ones here.

251
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,051
Maybe it's one of the security guards.

252
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,684
Oh. Hey, man. We should be wrapped up
any minute now.

253
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,041
You getting a bad vibe off this guy?

254
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,041
The longer the chase,
the slower the kill.

255
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,290
Help me.

256
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,409
This equipment belonged to Arthur Light.

257
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,443
- Wells fired him two years ago.
- Why?

258
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,165
Because he was a psycho.

259
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,280
Please tell me you can make this work.

260
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,685
I take back what I said.

261
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,166
I'll make this quick.

262
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,447
Now.

263
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,327
Gaah!

264
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,169
We're too late.

265
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,525
- Felicity.
- Cisco, Caitlin.

266
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,462
You guys okay? He
didn't hurt you, did he?

267
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:25,034
You said "he" twice.

268
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,807
Do you know who attacked us?
That lunatic with the mask and the sword?

269
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,082
No, I... No, I don't know.

270
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,883
I said "he" twice because on the radio...

271
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,050
I heard that the person who attacked you
had man parts, which would make him a he.

272
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,281
I'm John Diggle, I work
security for Queen Consolidated.

273
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,773
Do you have any idea what the
masked man may have taken?

274
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:47,435
An industrial centrifuge
by any chance?

275
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,009
- No. It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

276
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,851
- The kind I have to keep.
- Does Cisco have to keep it too?

277
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,525
Yes, he does.

278
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,008
Okay. We're so happy
that you guys are okay.

279
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,486
How's Barry doing?

280
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,206
- He's the same.
- Barry's condition deteriorated.

281
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,971
They moved him to S.T.A.R. Labs.
They've been looking after him.

282
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,160
- That's how I met Cisco and Caitlin.
- Right.

283
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,926
Well, I'll come visit
again as soon as I can.

284
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,169
That'd be cool. Don't worry,
Barry gets lots of visitors.

285
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,929
- Iris is there a lot. Heh.
- Iris?

286
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,570
She's, um...

287
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,762
his...

288
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,927
something.

289
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,005
Oh.

290
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,170
Sure, good.

291
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,210
That's just swell.

292
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,370
Barry's in a coma,
and he's already moved on.

293
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,402
I hacked into Harrison
Wells' personal files.

294
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,490
He's the director of S.T.A.R. Labs,
which basically makes me unstoppable.

295
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,563
And look what I found.

296
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,326
It's a prototype for one
of their new biotech projects.

297
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,375
The patent is still pending,

298
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:52,590
which is probably why they didn't
want to tell us what it was.

299
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,171
- So, what is it?
- It's a biotransfuser.

300
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,491
It can deliver blood from one single
patient into multiple patients at once.

301
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,809
- Why would Slade need a blood transfusion?
- He doesn't.

302
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,281
The prisoners that he
freed from Iron Heights

303
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,626
last week to create his
own personal army do.

304
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,486
With a few tweaks, Slade can
retrofit it for the Mirakuru...

305
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,816
bypassing what we know to
be a less-than-desirable

306
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,390
ratio of success to,
you know, death.

307
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,121
Instead of it metabolizing the person,
it happens in the machine.

308
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,290
That's gonna require a lot of blood.
And even a man with Slade's stamina...

309
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,131
- can't handle that kind of drain.
- Good.

310
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,527
- What do you mean?
- We let him use it.

311
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,728
He'll be weak, vulnerable...

312
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,884
and that will be my opportunity to
kill him. How do we find this thing?

313
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,487
A machine like this pulls an exorbitant
amount of power from the grid.

314
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,762
When it turns on, I'll know when and where.

315
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,042
Right now we just wait.

316
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,924
I'm tired of waiting.

317
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,083
Don't listen to him. He's lying.

318
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,723
- The cure is real, I promise.
- No, he's just trying to save his neck.

319
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,720
Anthony, look at me.

320
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,321
Tell us about the cure.

321
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,803
Uhn. I want to help you, Sara.

322
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,169
But first you have to promise
you'll help me too.

323
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,049
She can't save your life.

324
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,840
No one can. Not anymore.

325
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,525
All I ask is for a quick death.

326
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,002
You don't deserve a quick death.

327
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,924
I know.

328
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,324
And I'm still asking.

329
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,804
It's your call.

330
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,005
Thank you.

331
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,009
Start talking, Ivo.

332
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,931
I was never able to replicate
the Mirakuru serum...

333
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,806
from the original Japanese
World War ll research I discovered.

334
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,244
After conducting experiments on the
prisoners that I acquired this past year...

335
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,887
I was able to synthesize a solution...

336
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,889
that counteracts...

337
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,605
reverses...

338
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,249
the physiological effects
that exposure to Mirakuru produces.

339
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,847
From more than human...

340
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,241
back to human.

341
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,010
Where is this cure now?

342
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,686
You'll keep your word about ending my life?

343
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,690
Yes. Tell us.

344
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,806
On the freighter.

345
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,325
In the safe in my quarters.

346
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,801
Now I believe...

347
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,243
this concludes my end of our deal.

348
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,152
Whatever you came here to say,

349
00:23:57,177 --> 00:23:59,755
it takes security about 60
seconds to reach this floor...

350
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,651
- so I would start talking.
- Where's Slade?

351
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,840
I just wanted to give you the chance
to do the right thing.

352
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,322
I'm under 30 and I'm the CEO
of a Fortune 500 company.

353
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,602
I'd say I've already done the right thing.

354
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,730
Do you even know who Slade Wilson is?

355
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,128
- Or why he's doing this?
- I don't care.

356
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,243
- I got what I earned.
- What you earned?

357
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,522
You think that sleeping with my father
entitles you to my family's company?

358
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,440
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

359
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:28,040
He fooled around
with a lot of girls.

360
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,763
I don't see any of them
ordering hostile takeovers.

361
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:31,870
"Fooled around"?

362
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,324
Is that what your mother told you?

363
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,931
Of course she would write me off
as a meaningless affair.

364
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,242
Slade Wilson put me through hell.
His training nearly killed me.

365
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,569
Would I have put myself through all that
just because I was a jilted lover?

366
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,683
Honestly, I don't know what you are.

367
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,604
I was your father's soul mate.

368
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,486
- Heh.
- He was going to leave your mother.

369
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,529
Leave the company, leave you.

370
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,649
- Our bags were packed.
- Really?

371
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,084
Then your sister had to go and break her
arm, doing something ridiculous, no doubt.

372
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,806
She fell off her horse.

373
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,321
We were at the airport
when he got the call.

374
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,928
I begged him not to go. I reminded him
that Thea wasn't even his.

375
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,966
Are you saying that my father knew?

376
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,281
Of course he knew.

377
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,209
He was a fool, not an idiot.

378
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,767
And like a fool, he loved her anyway.

379
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,691
He promised me
that we would leave the next day.

380
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,407
But instead my internship was terminated
and he never spoke to me again.

381
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,371
Oh, so that's what this is really about?

382
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,166
He chose us over you?

383
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,801
- Please escort Mr. Queen off the premises.
- Don't touch me.

384
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,924
He's no longer welcome in this building.

385
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,326
My building.

386
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,241
- Hello?
- Thea, it's Ollie.

387
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,703
Listen, I just need five
minutes face to face.

388
00:25:58,728 --> 00:25:59,786
What do you want?

389
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,803
There's something you need to hear.

390
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,686
Five minutes.
Come by the club after we close.

391
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,166
I just spoke with Felicity.

392
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,409
Someone reached out to the Arrow,
wants a meeting.

393
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,171
- Who?
- Laurel.

394
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,108
You comfortable in
there, officer Lance?

395
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,434
I can see if there's an extra
blanket if you're cold.

396
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,647
No, I'm good.

397
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,161
Now I'm this side of the bars,
I think it's just Quentin.

398
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,170
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
You'll be out of here soon.

399
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,964
I appreciate your optimism.

400
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,526
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

401
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,405
Hey, buddy, officer, we need help.

402
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,040
- We need help. What are you doing?
- Remember me?

403
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,050
You should, because I
remember you, officer.

404
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,429
You can't do this.

405
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,046
Aah!

406
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,361
All right, take it easy.

407
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,484
You and that hooded freak show
are the reason I'm in this place.

408
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,086
I thought I should be the one
to welcome you.

409
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,929
- Get out of here.
- This isn't over! This is not over!

410
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,601
I heard about your father being arrested.

411
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,889
- If I could help him, I would.
- That's not what this is about.

412
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,168
It's funny, isn't it?

413
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,328
A year ago he thought you were a murderer.

414
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,444
And me, I was... I was drawn to you.

415
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,286
I couldn't explain why, but...

416
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,680
But a part of me felt connected to you.

417
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,522
You were always there.

418
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,609
For me.

419
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,568
For my family.
And for some reason I never asked why.

420
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,320
Are you asking now?

421
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,168
I don't have to...

422
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,124
because I already know the answer.

423
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,087
Hello?

424
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,721
It's Dad.

425
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,570
What is it?

426
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,325
Laurel, I'm so sorry. We had your father
under protective custody.

427
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,047
There's no such thing as
protective custody in Iron Heights.

428
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,888
- Dad.
- Hey.

429
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,790
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right, sweetheart.

430
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,690
I know you want...
Don't touch the ribs. The ribs.

431
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,408
I'm getting tired of visiting my family
members in a hospital. What happened?

432
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,046
Oh, it's just some old
collar, paid me a visit.

433
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,449
I guess I'm not the most popular guy
in prison.

434
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,486
Sara, do you mind giving Dad and I
a second alone, please?

435
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,048
Yeah, of course.

436
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,361
I'll be right outside.

437
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,806
Don't go far, sweetie.

438
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,371
- Dad.
- What is it, honey?

439
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,002
- I have to tell you something.
- What is it?

440
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,488
I know who the Arrow is.

441
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,331
What?

442
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,123
Don't say another word.

443
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,531
Don't say anything.

444
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,487
Okay.

445
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,408
Uhn. Listen to me...

446
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,043
there was a time when I would've sold out my
badge to find out his name, you know that.

447
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,963
But then I realized I didn't care
who he was. In fact...

448
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,131
- I didn't even want to know who he was.
- Why not?

449
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,326
Because I knew if I knew who he really was,
then he'd become a person, right?

450
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,683
Maybe he's got family, friends...

451
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,564
people that care about him...

452
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,842
someone with a life.

453
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,611
Then he couldn't be
what I needed him to be.

454
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,690
What this city needs him to be.

455
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,690
It's the Arrow that matters.

456
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,807
The man under the hood isn't important.

457
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,448
Can you imagine
what it's like to be him?

458
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,642
What he has to live with
day in and day out?

459
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,089
What that's gotta be like, eh?

460
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,722
Least I can do is sit here
and do a little bit of time for him.

461
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,845
How's your father?

462
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,283
He'll be better once you drop all charges
and sign his release papers.

463
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,562
- He is facing 18 months.
- Yes.

464
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,843
But he is not going to stay here another
day unless you want me to resign...

465
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,726
and embark on an exciting new career
as a criminal defense attorney...

466
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,481
whose sole ambition will be to sue
the District Attorney's Office...

467
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,524
for wrongful arrest
and reckless endangerment.

468
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,242
Your father will be released
on his own recognizance within the hour...

469
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,364
and reinstated tomorrow.

470
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,047
A word of advice?

471
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,444
Be mindful of the battles you choose,
because it will not always be this easy.

472
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,767
- Nice work, counselor.
- Ha-ha-ha.

473
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,883
Thank you.

474
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,167
How's your arm?

475
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,482
Hm. Fine. Only hurts when I wave.

476
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,644
- Ouch.
- I'm fine, I promise.

477
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,604
I know you will be.

478
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,685
Thanks.

479
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,689
Thank you for agreeing to talk to me.

480
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,124
- You're talking. I only agreed to listen.
- I just want to start with...

481
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,520
I know you think that...

482
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,571
Hold on.

483
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,290
I can't talk right now, Felicity.

484
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,047
I know, but the grid at Collins and Main just
spiked, drawing a hell of a lot of power.

485
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
Which means someone either plugged in
the world's largest hair dryer...

486
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,963
or the biotransfuser just went online.

487
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,602
The power cycle on this machine is very
specific. You have 30 minutes, 40 tops.

488
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,203
I know this is selfish, Oliver,
and don't hate me for saying this, but...

489
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,330
don't go.

490
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,001
If you don't get Thea to sign those documents,
your family loses all of its assets.

491
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,881
If I don't stop Slade right now,
a lot of people will lose a lot more.

492
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,041
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

493
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,608
Removing him mid-cycle
will surely end his life.

494
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,921
Slade, he's just a kid.

495
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,011
Who's here only because
you pushed him away.

496
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,282
You were the one person he looked up to.

497
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,887
And for that, you crushed his soul.

498
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,371
We found him at a shelter in Bludhaven.
Pathetic. He didn't even put up a fight.

499
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,846
I will.

500
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,769
Tell me how to shut it down.

501
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,409
If you could feel the power
that is surging through me...

502
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,362
you would know that I do not
fear an arrow.

503
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,929
I am stronger than you
can even imagine, and soon...

504
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,364
I will not be alone.

505
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,643
You can't hurt me, kid.

506
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,481
Come on, Roy. All right, stay with me.

507
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,611
He's lost a lot of blood.

508
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,017
I don't know what the biotransfuser did
to him, but his pulse is really weak.

509
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,113
He's barely breathing.

510
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,442
And he needs a real doctor.

511
00:36:47,467 --> 00:36:49,871
We can't take him to a hospital.
They run tests.

512
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,606
We need to keep what's in him
from getting out.

513
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,201
- What do we do now?
- Only thing we can do. We wait.

514
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,807
While we're waiting, we still have a Slade
problem. He's got 20 guys just like him...

515
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,645
- and we have no way to stop him.
- Yes, we do.

516
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,329
Is that what I think it is?

517
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,449
- Mirakuru.
- You weren't thinking about taking it...

518
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,880
- were you?
- No.

519
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,482
We're gonna use it to make a cure.

520
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,929
Oliver, we don't even know
if it's possible to reverse the effects.

521
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,009
Yes, we do.

522
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,446
Ivo did it.

523
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,928
Why didn't you ever tell us that, Oliver?

524
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,846
- Because I'm ashamed.
- Of what?

525
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,685
Five years ago, I had the chance
to use the cure on Slade.

526
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,441
I chose to kill him.

527
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,130
Everything that's happening now
is my fault.

528
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,161
I saved you once, Sara.

529
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,089
It feels like a long time ago now.

530
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,568
Time to return the favor.

531
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,887
You might not believe it now.

532
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,890
I was considered a good man.

533
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,526
A good doctor.

534
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,201
A good husband.

535
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,329
Until the Mirakuru drove me mad.

536
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,570
I didn't even take any myself...

537
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,166
You didn't have to do that for me.

538
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,727
Once you take a life...

539
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,685
it changes you forever.

540
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,924
And I don't want that for you.

541
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,404
Thank you.

542
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,251
So now what do we do?

543
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,644
I don't suppose any of you know
how to pilot a submarine.

544
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,165
Thea.

545
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,361
- What are you doing?
- Just grabbing some stuff.

546
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,321
Something tells me the mansion's
new owner won't want my clothes here.

547
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,051
- Thea, wait.
- Now he's not busy.

548
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,045
I'm so sorry. That couldn't be helped.

549
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,090
May I speak to you now?

550
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,964
Dad knew the truth.

551
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,801
What?

552
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,280
He knew about Merlyn.

553
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,041
How?

554
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,289
- He never said anything to me.
- He didn't have to.

555
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,410
Thea, whatever Dad's faults were...

556
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,485
he loved us.

557
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,682
All of us.

558
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,966
Because we were his family.

559
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,605
You were his daughter...

560
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,124
and some stupid blood test
wasn't gonna change that.

561
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,243
He chose us.

562
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,686
He chose you.

563
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,009
He made a decision to be your father...

564
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,209
even though he didn't have to be.

565
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,320
So, what does that tell you?

566
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,286
It tells me that he's a liar.

567
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,484
Just like both of you.

568
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,008
I need you guys to do me a favor.

569
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,645
This time it'll be our secret.

570
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,369
Oliver.

571
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,250
What's this for?

572
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,370
Because you're important to me.
