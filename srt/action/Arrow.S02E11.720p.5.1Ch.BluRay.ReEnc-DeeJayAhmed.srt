2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,002
My name is Oliver Queen.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,925
After five years on a hellish island...

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,811
I have come home with only one goal:

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,082
To save my city.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,523
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,723
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,047
I must be something else.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,080
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,089
It can save you or it could kill you.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,089
Slade has the Mirakuru in his system.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,290
The ones who survived,
they became someone else.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,887
It's the Mirakuru, it's
messing with your head.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,487
I know you and your new friends
have the Mirakuru.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,122
In exchange, I'll promise you and
your friends safe passage off this island.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,129
Slade's gone and he took the Mirakuru.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,368
You know who he is
under that hood, don't you?

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,441
Once he has lost everyone
and everything he values...

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,450
I will drive an arrow through his eye.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,246
Welcome to St. Walker's, alderman.
Or should I call you mayor?

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,522
Thank you for letting me
come by so late.

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,682
Oh, I can imagine
how busy your schedule is.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,924
It's really great of you taking the time
to come visit your aunt.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,088
Her health has taken a bad turn.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,163
Of course.

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,448
She's family.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,448
Maya, look who came to see you.
It's your nephew, Sebastian.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,051
Don't go, please.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,329
We'll be fine. Thank you.

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,361
Still worshipping the old gods, I see.

31
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,000
They're the last thing I
have of your father's.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,362
They protect me.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,211
He was supposed to protect you.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,883
A friend of mine, Laurel Lance,
came by to visit you a couple days ago.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Do you remember her?

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,300
<i>Ella es muy linda.</i>
(She is very pretty.)

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,329
Yes, she is.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,480
What did you both talk about?

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,300
Nada.
(Nothing.)

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,320
- Nothing.
- You know I don't like it when you lie to me.

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,340
I told her the truth.

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,160
That you... you killed him.
Your father.

43
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,250
<i>¡Mi esposo!</i>
(My husband!)

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,720
I don't know what came over me.
I am so, so sorry.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,360
I hurt you, mijo (my son).

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,400
<i>Está bien.</i>
(It's okay.)

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
<i>No te preocupes.</i>
(Don't worry.)

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,880
But you are my child, my son.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,367
And I hurt you.

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,241
I forgive you, Mama.

51
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
I forgive you for everything.

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
<i>La luz de dios me rodea,</i>
(The light of God surrounds me,)

53
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:21,555
<i>el amor de dios me envuelve,</i>
(the love of God enfolds me,)

54
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:23,487
<i>el poder de dios me protege,</i>
(the power of God protects me,)

55
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
<i>la presencia de dios vela por mí.</i>
(the presence of God watches over me.)

56
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,150
<i>Los dioses están muertos.</i>
(The Gods are dead.)

57
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,084
Please, I don't...
Look, I don't know anything.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,171
- The man in the skull mask. Where is he?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,700
He's been experimenting on people
in the Glades.

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,122
He's leaving a trail of corpses
with blood running from their eyes.

61
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,041
No, no, no. I deal in stolen merchandise.
That is it.

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,401
Don't. Please. Come on.

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,841
- Ask him what color his shoes are.
- What?

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,283
You want this guy to take a polygraph
via Bluetooth, cool...

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,242
but I need to hear him establish a baseline.
I need to hear him tell the truth just once.

66
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,484
What color are your shoes?

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,170
What?

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,566
They're blue.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,484
He's not lying.

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,691
Please.

71
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,770
He's out there.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,844
- Somewhere.
- Come home.

73
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,162
We can't do any more tonight.

74
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,210
Slade?

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,730
Slade?

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,570
Thought maybe he'd come back here.

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,202
He has the Mirakuru serum in his
bloodstream. He's not thinking clearly.

78
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,568
So, what do we do now?

79
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,403
I don't know, Sara.

80
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,210
The sensor grid is still active.

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,882
So at least we're gonna know
if Ivo and his men come back to the island.

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,407
So we just sit here and wait?

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,889
Do you have any other ideas?
Because right now, I'm open to suggestions.

84
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,405
We find Slade
and maybe we consider Ivo's offer.

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,721
What?

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,243
Look, if we get the serum back from Slade,
then we can go home.

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,404
And I can try to talk to Ivo.
I can get him to listen to me.

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,365
Like he listened
before he shot Shado in the head?

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,121
- He's just tired and he's frustrated.
- What?

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,768
You don't understand what finding
the Mirakuru serum has meant to him.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,843
You're right, Sara. I don't understand.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,522
And I don't get how you could even consider
trusting him after what he did.

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,449
He's not evil.

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,607
He kept me safe on that
ship for over a year.

95
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,921
And I mean, not just safe.
He taught me things.

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,687
- And I learned a lot.
- I learned a lot too.

97
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,608
This island taught me
that you can't trust anyone.

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,964
Ms. Lance? I have a call
for you on line two.

99
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,123
Thank you, Katherine.

100
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,201
Laurel Lance.

101
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,767
This is Nurse Downey from St. Walker's.

102
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,925
You asked me to call if there was
any changes in Maya Resik's condition.

103
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,970
I'm sad to report she passed away.

104
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,091
- What?
- Her heart gave out on her, poor soul.

105
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,806
You think Sebastian Blood,
the saint of Starling City...

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,004
- killed his own mother?
- He was the last person to see her alive.

107
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,110
- That isn't a coincidence.
- He's the devoted nephew visiting a sick relative.

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,442
- You're right, that's very suspicious.
- He didn't go there to visit her.

109
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,844
He went there to kill her, to cover up the
fact that as a child, he killed his father.

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,970
- Maya Resik told me what happened.
- From inside a padded room.

111
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,961
He had her forcibly committed. She tells me the
truth and two days later, has a heart attack.

112
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,192
You don't find that strange?

113
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:06,202
For one thing, there's no
record that Maya Resik...

114
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,573
was even Blood's mother,
and according to the hospital

115
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:10,474
she was in the late
stages of heart disease.

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,802
I need you to call in a favor
with Judge Carlin.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,368
Get a search warrant for Sebastian's
campaign headquarters. His phone records...

118
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,729
- I have to start somewhere.
- Laurel, this isn't some casual request.

119
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,446
I'm the ADA who took Vertigo on live TV.

120
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,531
I take a shot at Sebastian Blood and miss,
my career is done.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,490
Adam.

122
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,368
- Please.
- I'm sorry, Laurel.

123
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,284
You're on your own.

124
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,969
Hello, Roy.

125
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,889
Lurking in an alley,
that's not at all creepy.

126
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,567
When I ran the club,
I learned all the secret entrances.

127
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,128
I never got a chance to thank you
for saving my mother's life.

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,804
Thea told me.
She said that you were very brave.

129
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,080
- I did what anyone would have done.
- Not anyone.

130
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,046
Takes a lot to run towards danger,
not away from it.

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,569
That sounded like praise.

132
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,207
I thought where I was concerned,
you didn't approve.

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,688
Thea said that you also got hit
by some falling debris.

134
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,206
- How you feeling?
- Actually, it mostly missed me.

135
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,368
I'm fine. Look, I gotta get back to work.

136
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,802
Has Roy mentioned anything about the man
in the skull mask who injected him?

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,288
Roy is not the kind of guy who is
comfortable discussing his feelings.

138
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,522
Not like you and me.

139
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,922
Don't yell at me, but I really think we need
a new plan to find this creepy mask guy.

140
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,230
Scaring the crap out of lowlifes
isn't yielding results.

141
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,447
Felicity, I am open
to any and all suggestions.

142
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,200
Oliver, maybe we're overthinking this.

143
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,126
What if the mask simply got wind that you
were after him and decided to skip town?

144
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,632
He didn't go to the trouble
of re-creating the

145
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:58,072
serum and testing it on
people just to walk away.

146
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,811
He is still out there
and we need to locate him.

147
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,086
Lance. For the Arrow.

148
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,608
- Yes, detective.
- Can we meet?

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,290
What is it?

150
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,648
Someone wants to talk to you.

151
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,164
Hello, Laurel.

152
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,725
You're late.

153
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,970
I had to circle around to make sure there
wasn't a SWAT team waiting for me again.

154
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,491
That's fair.

155
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,784
Trust me, I wouldn't have
asked my father to put

156
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,908
me in touch with you if
I had any other choice.

157
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,650
- What do you need?
- Sebastian Blood.

158
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,082
He's about to be the new mayor
of Starling City.

159
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,171
- I know who he is.
- No, you don't. No one does.

160
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,283
A few weeks ago, I was approached by your
groupie, Roy Harper, and his girlfriend.

161
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,366
They asked me to investigate
the death of Max Stanton.

162
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,526
You think Blood was involved
in Stanton's death?

163
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,923
Blood or a man that worked for him
named Cyrus Gold.

164
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,687
Gold killed four cops, including
my father's partner, Lucas Hilton.

165
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,328
Blood and Gold knew each other from the
orphanage that Blood was raised at.

166
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,366
He would do anything to keep the truth
about his past hidden.

167
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,043
Including murdering his own mother.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,161
Why would he do that?

169
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,722
To cover up the fact that
he killed his father.

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,486
I tried going to the DA.
No one will believe me.

171
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,684
I swear to you,
Sebastian Blood is dangerous.

172
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,566
And you're the only person
in this city who can stop him.

173
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,570
Laurel was right.
I hacked Blood's cell phone records.

174
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,310
The alderman and Gold have stayed buddies
since Zandia orphanage.

175
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,651
So, what? They kept in touch.

176
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,640
Doesn't exactly mean that Sebastian Blood
is the man in the skull mask.

177
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,963
His last name is Blood.
That can't be a good sign.

178
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,562
Felicity, he's dedicated his life, risked
his life, to help the people of the Glades.

179
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,561
And in his spare time, he's a murderer
trying to create an army of human weapons?

180
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,969
You're a personal bodyguard who fights
crime at night with his billionaire boss.

181
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,084
Not a lot of people
show their real face in public.

182
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,082
Oliver, what are you thinking?

183
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,611
Laurel gave me a case number to start with.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,526
We need to know if Sebastian
really killed his father.

185
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,360
Then we figure out if there's a chance
he has the Mirakuru formula.

186
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,246
- I'm on it.
- What if this is just another trap set by Laurel?

187
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,570
She could be setting you up, and this time
you wouldn't have Sara to save you.

188
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,726
Asking a cute girl to meet you
down by the tracks, Harper?

189
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,930
- Good thing Thea and I are tight.
- I have to show you something.

190
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,884
Easy there, tiger.

191
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,041
You're not even bleeding.

192
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,288
- When did you start juicing?
- I'm not.

193
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,046
Then how do you explain what I just saw?

194
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,517
You remember that night around
Christmas I went missing?

195
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,995
Yeah, Thea and I were pissed.

196
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,124
I never told you guys
what really happened.

197
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,891
You were right about your friend Max.
He didn't OD.

198
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,805
He was murdered.
He was injected with something...

199
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,166
and I was injected with the same thing.
But it didn't kill me, it made me stronger.

200
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,448
- Thea must be freaking.
- No, she doesn't know.

201
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,847
- I don't want her to.
- Why not?

202
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,522
I can't. Not yet. Not until I know
more about what happened to me.

203
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,843
- I don't wanna scare her.
- And you're not worried about scaring me?

204
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,168
Come on,
I was going crazy not telling someone.

205
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,003
So, what are you gonna do?

206
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,962
Well, the Arrow once told me
all I was good for was taking a beating.

207
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,369
Maybe it's time
I started handing out a few of my own.

208
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,647
I don't follow.

209
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,008
Now I don't need his help to protect
this city. Let's find us a bad guy.

210
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,161
I have good news and bad news.

211
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,682
I suggest the good news first.
Tends to soften the blow of the bad news.

212
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,165
Okay, dealer's choice. Good news is we found
the case file on Sebastian's dad's murder.

213
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,682
- Anything in it to suggest he killed him?
- Oliver, meet bad news.

214
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,450
That file was sealed years ago.

215
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,804
And since the file is over 27 years old,
there is no digital copy for me to hack.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,721
The only hard copy is stored
the old-fashioned way in the city archives.

217
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,360
So I go in and take it
the old-fashioned way.

218
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,725
Except security in the file room is so
old-school, you need a keycard to get in...

219
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,646
which even if you had, you wouldn't
know where to start looking for the file.

220
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,964
An assistant DA would.

221
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,049
You said you needed my help.
Now I need yours.

222
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,084
- What do you need?
- You.

223
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,409
Know what I really miss about being home?

224
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,763
My bed.

225
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,691
I don't know if I even remember
what a bed feels like anymore.

226
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,441
And you probably never will.

227
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,763
And neither will I.

228
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,530
Sara.

229
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,610
We are gonna...

230
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,287
We're gonna find a way off the island.

231
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,803
You just have to trust me.

232
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,290
Last time I trusted you
was right before the Gambit went down.

233
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,685
I haven't gotten a chance to say this.

234
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,321
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,640
I know this is my fault.

236
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,805
And that none of this would have happened if
I hadn't invited you on the boat with me.

237
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,285
That's not exactly true.

238
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,801
I mean, I was the one who said yes.

239
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,721
- And it was only half because of your charm.
- The other half?

240
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,209
Do you remember when you spilled
that beer on me at Tommy's party?

241
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,647
No. But I never left one of Tommy's parties
with my memory intact.

242
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,763
Well, I wasn't even supposed to go.

243
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,089
But I snuck out of the house because
I knew you were gonna be there.

244
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,684
I mean, I had this... Heh.
I had this embarrassing crush on you.

245
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,844
And Laurel, she knew it.

246
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,444
I think that's why the party
got broken up by the cops.

247
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,529
She tipped off our dad.

248
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,521
And I was grounded for a month
and the next thing I knew...

249
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,611
you and Laurel were together.

250
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,963
You think she did all that on purpose?

251
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,045
Not everybody is what they seem.

252
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,964
We should get some sleep.

253
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,050
- You ready for this?
- Whatever it takes.

254
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,047
We're going in.

255
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,410
At least the security cameras
are from this century.

256
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,811
And now they're toast.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,810
You have exactly seven minutes
until the system reboots.

258
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,205
Hey, check it out.

259
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,922
This could take a while.

260
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,287
You have six minutes.

261
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,606
I'm rebooting the monitors.
There's a Trojan plugging our system.

262
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,081
It's probably some punk.

263
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,561
Uh-oh.

264
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,602
- Oliver.
- What's wrong?

265
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,485
It looks like we got
the one rent-a-cop with a brain here.

266
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,121
If there's a camera nearby,
I recommend hiding.

267
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,485
Look, there.

268
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,970
You gotta send some officers here.

269
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,110
Starling's finest will be there any minute.
You need to get out of there now.

270
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,600
We're not leaving without the file.

271
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,847
Laurel.

272
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,963
I can't find it.

273
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,409
Up there. Third floor.

274
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,606
Hurry, Oliver.

275
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,690
Wait. "Case number SC-43878." This is it.

276
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,811
Vigilante, we know you're here!
Close everything off, now!

277
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,248
They're blocking
our only way out.

278
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,994
It's not our only way. Go to
the east wall and wait for me.

279
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
Hands where I can see them!

280
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,750
I tried going through all the security
footage at the city archives...

281
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,870
- to see if anyone swiped the file over the last few days.
- Did you see anyone?

282
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,530
Just this.

283
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,567
It's all been erased.

284
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,960
So what happened when you reversed the
footprint to see who hacked in before you?

285
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,084
- I struck out again. Must have been an inside job.
- Meaning?

286
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,521
As a city alderman, Blood
would have access to the files.

287
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,707
Oliver, anyone on city
payroll could have done this.

288
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,716
He's running for mayor. One
hint that he killed his

289
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,670
father, his political future
is dead in the water.

290
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,760
Wait, I thought you two were
supposed to be friends.

291
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,764
Don't you think you ought to give him
the benefit of the doubt?

292
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,931
Please keep digging into Blood's past and
see if there's anything that can help us.

293
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,448
- Where are you going?
- To give a friend the benefit of the doubt.

294
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,681
What, are you still giving me
the cold shoulder?

295
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,764
You still not telling me
what the hell is going on with you?

296
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,450
Am I interrupting?

297
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,008
He and I would actually have to be talking
for you to be interrupting.

298
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,440
Can I try?

299
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,688
Be my guest.

300
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,281
- Tell her.
- No.

301
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,766
What have you got for me?

302
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,281
This guy in the Glades,
the Starling Slasher...

303
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,165
word on the street is
he's got a thing for prostitutes.

304
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,045
And by "thing," I mean he has a thing
for slicing them up.

305
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,050
- Mostly hunts in Crescent Circle.
- Sounds like a great guy.

306
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,961
Mm. Yeah, problem is, he's some big-shot
lawyer, so no one has the sack to ID him.

307
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,390
Wait, this sounds exactly like someone
the Arrow would go after.

308
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,750
- We don't need the Arrow anymore.
- We're gonna have to bait him.

309
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,560
What pro is gonna let us
dangle her in front of a psycho?

310
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,001
- No. No. No way. No.
- Hey, Thea. Uh.

311
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,405
Sin has a date.
She was hoping to borrow an outfit.

312
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,364
You know, something slutty.

313
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,725
I have the perfect first-date outfit.
Guarantees a second one.

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
- Great.
- This guy won't know what hit him.

315
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,769
Or girl. Whatever you're into.

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,607
- I could do your makeup or your hair.
- You are not touching the hair, Queen.

317
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,325
Okay.

318
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,527
- You looking for me?
- Sebastian. Good to see you.

319
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,730
You too, man. Listen, I'm so sorry but I'm
right in the middle of a polling snafu.

320
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,241
I'll be quick.
I just had a question about Laurel.

321
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,320
- Of course. Is everything okay?
- I'm not sure.

322
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,720
I ran into her the other day.
And something just seemed off.

323
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,360
I know the two of you've been
spending a lot of time together.

324
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,727
I just wanted to know if you knew anything.

325
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,521
Well, we've traded phone calls,
but she's in trial, I've been campaigning.

326
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,169
- We haven't really been able to connect.
- Nothing happened between the two of you?

327
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,931
Not an argument or a fight or something?

328
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,886
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were
coming to me like a jealous ex-boyfriend.

329
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,130
No, just...
No, I'm just looking out for a friend.

330
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,647
- And I hope you'd do the same.
- Of course.

331
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,605
Listen, I will take care of Laurel.

332
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,041
Thank you for letting me know.

333
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,449
You're new.

334
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,361
- Got to start somewhere, right?
- Get in.

335
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,004
Romantic.

336
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,922
- You're pretty.
- You're disgusting.

337
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,246
I see you'd like to play rough.

338
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
Wait.

339
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,406
- I've got money.
- Keep it.

340
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,926
Roy. Roy, stop it, you're killing him.

341
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,167
Sin? Sin, I'm sorry.

342
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,211
We have to call an ambulance.

343
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,330
"Point-blank range.

344
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,047
Single shot to the heart from a low angle."

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,846
Obviously the handiwork
of someone quite scared...

346
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,087
and very small.

347
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,883
How come the police didn't arrest you?

348
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,082
I knew how to cover my tracks.

349
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,727
A skill you've obviously lost
since you've gotten bigger.

350
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,482
You know how close you came to allowing
the vigilante to destroy everything?

351
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,967
Someone spoke out of turn.

352
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,924
I've taken care of the problem.

353
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,049
Your mother was not our problem.

354
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,409
- Laurel Lance is.
- You're the one who told me to get close to her.

355
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,365
You said that it was part of the plan
to hurt the vigilante.

356
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,724
It is. But you being sloppy isn't.

357
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,801
Fix this, Mr. Blood.

358
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,444
You don't want me to fix it for you.

359
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,971
Brother Daily.
I need you to take care of something.

360
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,530
Whoever you are, I'm calling the police.

361
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,165
No need to.

362
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,648
- Remember me?
- Officer Daily, right?

363
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,729
What's this all about?

364
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,769
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We have a warrant.

365
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,970
- A warrant for what?
- Found these in your bedroom, Ms. Lance.

366
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,447
These aren't prescribed to you.
That's a felony.

367
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,768
This is ridiculous.

368
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,124
You're under arrest for possession
of a controlled substance.

369
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,004
You have the right to remain silent.

370
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,920
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

371
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,325
I know what this looks like...

372
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,127
but you have to listen to me.

373
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,088
I know what's happening.

374
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,603
Sebastian Blood, he's setting me up...

375
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,122
because he knows I'm onto him.
He's trying to frame me.

376
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,368
So he planted drugs in your apartment?

377
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,927
No, no. Forget about the drugs.
The point is...

378
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,203
is that he is the one
behind this witch hunt.

379
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,644
Sebastian called your boss.
He's worried about you.

380
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,446
No, no. He wasn't worried about me.

381
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,041
He's just trying to discredit me.

382
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,810
Don't you see what he's doing?

383
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,000
What I see is that you
tested positive for opiates.

384
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,524
I see that you have been lying to me and I
see that you have been stealing from me.

385
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,041
I can explain that.

386
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,006
Every person that stands where you're
standing now says the same thing.

387
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,965
- Dad...
- The DUI, the paranoia about Blood...

388
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,083
you looking like hell.

389
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,970
- You got a problem, Laurel.
- No.

390
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,524
It's addiction. It runs in our family.

391
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,091
You can't pin it on Sebastian Blood.

392
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,881
Daddy, please, you have to believe me.

393
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,921
Please. Please.

394
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,844
I don't, baby.

395
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,566
No, Dad...

396
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,764
How is she?

397
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,204
I don't know.

398
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,962
I don't know anything anymore.

399
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,364
I'll get her home.

400
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,204
Thanks.

401
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,684
Anthony?

402
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,803
- Are you there?
- I'm here, Sara.

403
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,408
I was hoping that you would
reach out to me. Are you alone?

404
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,564
Yes.

405
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,921
Are you all right?

406
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,764
You're not hurt, are you?

407
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,203
Do you even care?
You were gonna shoot me.

408
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,611
No. No, Sara, I swear.
You were never in danger, I swear.

409
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,088
So it's okay because you were
just planning on murdering Shado?

410
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,923
- Her name was Shado?
- Yes.

411
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,363
And you killed her, Anthony.

412
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,451
And I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

413
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,251
I never set out to hurt anyone.

414
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,800
I started this quest to save people.
To save the human race.

415
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,885
I know.

416
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,887
Sara.

417
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,682
I know you think
that this ship rescued you...

418
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,486
when you were stranded at sea.

419
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,122
The truth is...

420
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,527
you rescued me.

421
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,289
But now the darkness
is threatening me again.

422
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,522
I need you, Sara.

423
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,690
Please.

424
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,129
Save me.

425
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,481
How's he doing?

426
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,001
The damage done to his head
and lower abdomen is severe.

427
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,647
He ruptured his spleen and he has
massive swelling in his brain.

428
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,243
Thankfully, he got medical attention
quickly, so he's got a shot.

429
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,010
You did a good thing here, Roy.

430
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,527
What happened to you out there?

431
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,200
- I don't know.
- We nearly killed this guy.

432
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,925
Roy?

433
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,243
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing here?

434
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,521
Sin called me.

435
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,048
- Why did you do that?
- Because she was worried about you.

436
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,525
Who is that guy?

437
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,367
He was my date. We put him there.

438
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,041
You did this?

439
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,841
- Just drop it, please?
- Roy, something is happening to you.

440
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,769
I'm not judging you.

441
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,724
I'm not angry with you.

442
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,082
I'm on your side.

443
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,567
I just want to help you.

444
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,449
You can't.

445
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,449
I... I got to go.

446
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,404
Roy.

447
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,362
You haven't said much.

448
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,602
Quietly working on your lecture?

449
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,529
No lecture.

450
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,803
Suppose you think I was
wrong about Sebastian too, then?

451
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,684
I think...

452
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,800
that you have everyone fooled...

453
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,368
because you want people to think
that none of this gets to you.

454
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,885
And that you don't need anyone's help.

455
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,282
- I don't.
- Except I know you.

456
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,003
This isn't you.

457
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,368
What happened to no lectures?

458
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,771
I just... I need a glass of water.

459
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,966
Do you mind? Please.

460
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,684
Leave him. He's not important.

461
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,002
Hello, Laurel.

462
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,844
Laurel.

463
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,604
It's me. Someone kidnapped Laurel.

464
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,963
- Do you know where they took her?
- I think I have a pretty good idea.

465
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,964
If that mask is supposed to scare me...

466
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,883
all that it's doing is confirming
what I've already known for a while now.

467
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,571
You're one sick son of a bitch, Sebastian.

468
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,890
Thirty thousand years ago,
masks invested their wearer with authority.

469
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,042
- Like a god.
- You're insane.

470
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,330
I'm not the one making drug-addled
unsubstantiated accusations...

471
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,204
against Starling's favorite son.

472
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,405
If I can find out the truth,
then others can too.

473
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,570
You found out nothing.

474
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,650
- You know nothing.
- Ugh!

475
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,161
Get away from her...

476
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,883
or I will put you down.

477
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,608
And to think, a few short months
ago, you were trying to arrest him.

478
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,327
You wanted me here. I'm here.

479
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,370
Let her go.

480
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,444
No, I think she should witness this.

481
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,328
Take off his mask.

482
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,608
I need to see.

483
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,124
Sweetheart.

484
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,130
Are you all right?

485
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,565
Yeah.

486
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,725
Looks like Daily
was behind this whole thing.

487
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,049
The son of a bitch volunteered
for the raid that got Hilton killed.

488
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,604
And we found the accelerant that he used to
torch the Langford Institute in his apartment.

489
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,360
I thought it was Sebastian.

490
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,007
I was so sure.

491
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,966
Yeah.

492
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,811
Well, that's the thing about
the booze and the pills.

493
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,850
You know,
the same thing that dulls your pain...

494
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,124
clouds the judgment.

495
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,408
Can we have a minute?

496
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,284
Yeah.

497
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,889
Are you here to say "I told you so"?

498
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,290
We're dropping the possession charges and
you won't be charged in Daily's shooting.

499
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,084
It was clearly self-defense.

500
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,770
You don't seem that thrilled for me.

501
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,649
Are you gonna look me in the eye...

502
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,009
and tell me you don't have
a substance-abuse problem?

503
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,850
The DA's office has a generous
severance package.

504
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,044
Wait. Wait, let me explain to DA Spencer.

505
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,767
- I can... I can tell her everything.
- This isn't coming from Spencer, Laurel.

506
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,486
This is me. I'm the one that hired you.

507
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,090
I'm sorry...

508
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,966
but you're done.

509
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,481
Did Laurel really shoot him?

510
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,161
- She saved my life.
- That's a good thing, Oliver.

511
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,209
You okay?

512
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,041
She really had me believing that Sebastian
Blood was a criminal mastermind...

513
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,406
and the only reason that I nearly
believed her was because it was Laurel.

514
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,483
I do have a blind spot
where she's concerned.

515
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,567
Not anymore.

516
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,923
Certainly know how to
talk yourself out of a victory.

517
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,011
- It's a gift.
- Take the win, man.

518
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,050
Daily's dead.
You destroyed the serum. It's over.

519
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,602
No, it isn't.

520
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,965
Hey.

521
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,844
Slow night?

522
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,768
- Something I said?
- Don't take it personally.

523
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,770
He won't even make eye contact with me.

524
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,843
Something happen?

525
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,441
He put someone in the hospital.

526
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,330
He's a little stingy with the details,
but you should've seen this guy.

527
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,525
I don't understand how any human
could've done that to another.

528
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,762
Each day he becomes more and more
like somebody I don't even know.

529
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,004
He won't even listen to me.

530
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,885
I know someone he'll listen to.

531
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,884
Sara, are you still there?

532
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,491
When you first found me...

533
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,086
I felt like you were my savior.

534
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,841
And letting me into your work, I felt
like I was a part of something bigger.

535
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,121
You are, Sara.

536
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,046
It was only because I didn't want
to see what you were really doing.

537
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,330
I mean, what you did
to those people on the boat...

538
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,569
and how you tortured them for science.

539
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,161
How I was glad that I wasn't one of them.

540
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,090
But now...

541
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,091
I'd rather be dead
than keep being a part of this.

542
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,203
You ungrateful bitch.

543
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,528
You think you know what torture is?

544
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,526
You have no idea. But I will show you.

545
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,281
I am gonna hunt you down,
both of you, and I will show...

546
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,327
Let's go find Slade.

547
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,051
It's done.

548
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,331
They think it was all Daily.

549
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,761
He sacrificed himself for our cause.

550
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,962
A good start.

551
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,688
But the magnitude of your negligence
requires a greater sacrifice.

552
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,445
Your incompetence has now cost four lives,
alderman.

553
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,131
Fail me again,
and yours will be the fifth.

554
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,724
If that was supposed to go through
my other leg, you missed.

555
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,845
You seem to be healing pretty well.

556
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,287
You're stronger, you heal faster,
but you're not in control.

557
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,209
The serum that you were exposed to...

558
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,927
it changes your body,
but it also warps your mind.

559
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,448
- How do you know so much about it?
- I've seen it before.

560
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,521
It twists men. Turns them into
someone they don't recognize.

561
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,882
Someone dangerous.

562
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,325
Maybe you should
put another arrow through me.

563
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,250
This time through my heart.

564
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,807
There's another way, Roy.

565
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,127
I can teach you to control
your new ability.

566
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,082
To control yourself.

567
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,529
Let me help you.

568
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,569
When do we start?
