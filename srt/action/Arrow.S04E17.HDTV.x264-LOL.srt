Previously on "Arrow"
and "Flash"...

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,875
Brie Larvan,
a quite brilliant

3
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:06,286
roboticist who once
developed

4
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:07,631
miniature mechanical bees

5
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,066
for military use.

6
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,433
Barry, I hacked into
the bees' frequency.

7
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,602
I'm controlling them.

8
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:14,103
Brie's restrained.

9
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:14,832
Boom!

10
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,032
It's an implantable
biostimulant.

11
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,265
This little piece
of technology's

12
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,666
gonna help me
walk again?

13
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:20,228
After it's implanted
in your spine, yes.

14
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:22,418
I found Quentin Lance's
testimony to be

15
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,420
particularly compelling.

16
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:25,622
On the strength of it,

17
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,657
Mr. Darhk will be held
without bail

18
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,325
or possibility of release.

19
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,796
It is, uh, too hard
to be here with you

20
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,563
every night and not
be with you.

21
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:38,167
I don't want to
let you go.

22
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:40,069
But I'm
already gone.

23
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,957
Computer time's up,
Blondie.

24
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,258
Don't think so.

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,526
The judge granted me
a minimum

26
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:06,795
of 30 minutes
per week.

27
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,030
I have 90 more
seconds.

28
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:10,999
Well, the judge
ain't here. I am.

29
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,367
Let's see what you're
so hot for

30
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,636
without Internet connection.

31
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:16,538
Bees.

32
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,040
I like bees.

33
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:22,064

35
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,322
Thea, your back foot's
sliding out.

36
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:34,823
No it's not!

37
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:38,660
Just because
you can't see me

38
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:40,195
doesn't mean
I'm not there.

39
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:41,497
You got to sense
my presence

40
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,031
even when I'm not
in your eyeline.

41
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,501
What advice would you
give to me?

42
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:46,502
Humor me.

43
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:47,669
You're
getting tired,

44
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:48,871
you're dropping
your shoulder,

45
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,239
and you're opening
yourself up.

46
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,082
So you took your
morning run

47
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,583
from 6 miles to what?

48
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,352
Maybe two?

49
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:04,753
Yeah. Well, taking care
of a toddler's

50
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,555
a marathon in itself.

51
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,090
Right, but when you
sacrifice your endurance,

52
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:10,259
you're losing steam
too early in our sessions.

53
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,360
Let's go again.

54
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:12,528
Ohh, pass.

55
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,062
I keep on running out
of excuses

56
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,330
for all my new bruises,

57
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:18,033
and they're from you,
not bad guys.

58
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:19,301
The streets have gone
quiet since we took

59
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,769
Darhk off the board.

60
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:21,904
His organization
hasn't been.

61
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:23,872
HIVE is still
out there.

62
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:25,340
Yeah, and when they rear their head,
we'll take care of them,

63
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:26,575
but we have to celebrate
our victories.

64
00:02:26,577 --> 00:02:27,910
If we don't,

65
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:29,745
we forget what we're
fighting for.

66
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:30,879
What's wrong?

67
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:33,282
Alex has a new
job interview

68
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:35,384
with Ruvé Darhk.

69
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,718
What?

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
She's looking for a new
chief of staff

71
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,755
before the April 6
election.

72
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:41,156
Still don't see why
you just can't put yourself

73
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,558
back in the race, Oliver.

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,092
You know, voters,
they hate flip-flopping,

75
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:45,561
and that would be
a pretty big one.

76
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:48,030
I can't let him work
for the wife

77
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:49,131
of the Prince
of Darkness.

78
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,599
And what if he got
a better offer?

79
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,401
Are you gonna run
for mayor?

80
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,236
Palmer Tech.
They're hiring

81
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:56,405
a new head
of public relations.

82
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,706
Oh.

83
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:02,044
I just heard that
from someone.

84
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,980
Laurel, she's not
Voldemort,

85
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,615
and I'm fine.

86
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:07,950
That's a good idea.

87
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:10,419
You should tell Alex
to talk to Felicity.

88
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,854
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:12,921
What?

90
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:14,957
Nothing. It's just--

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,326
it's shocking that you
know who Voldemort is.

92
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,428
Well, I'm not immune
to pop culture.

93
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,129
I read a few of
the "Harry Potter" books.

94
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,833
Really? I was gonna bet
Thea that you just saw the movies.

95
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:26,134
There were movies?

96
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,109
Mr. Queen,
where are my men?

97
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:35,944
I don't know, Reiter.

98
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,846
They're your men.

99
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,848
I wasn't gonna wait around
for them to kill me.

100
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,051
And what of
Miss Venediktov?

101
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,987
She's still here.

102
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:46,455
Don't move!

103
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:48,991
Where's my idol?

104
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:50,425
It's not your concern
anymore.

105
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:53,662
It's nearby.
I can feel it.

106
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,863
The powers they
bestowed

107
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:55,964
are on the wane,
but--

108
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,499
Enough!

109
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:03,972
As I was saying,

110
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:06,541
the magics are
losing their potency,

111
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:07,976
but I still have
enough to make

112
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:10,779
short work
of the two of you.

113
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:15,150
A quarter of a million
dollars per unit.

114
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,852
It's hard to believe
something so small

115
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:18,687
could cost
so much money.

116
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,289
When Digital Equipment
Corporation released

117
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,325
the first VAX,
it cost $700,000--

118
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:25,427
Achoo!

119
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:27,095
Achoo!

120
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,665
Achoo!

121
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,000
So you could think
of this as a bargain.

122
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:33,068
Except we're not
starting

123
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,469
a computer
revolution here.

124
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,071
We're trying to
repair spinal injuries.

125
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:37,839
The new estimate
of spinal injuries

126
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:41,310
per year are
at 12,000 people.

127
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,211
Unless everyone's
a billionaire,

128
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,846
walking again is
a luxury item.

129
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:46,348
Sounds like something
Mr. Dennis would say.

130
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,050
He already has.

131
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:49,251
He's called
a board meeting

132
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:50,485
to discuss how many
zeroes he can add

133
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:51,687
to the end
of that price point.

134
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,088
Achoo!

135
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,990
Anything I can do
to help you?

136
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:56,658
No. You can't do
anything with that cold.

137
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,026
Go home, get some rest,
get some chicken noodle soup.

138
00:04:58,028 --> 00:04:59,261
You sound like
my mother.

139
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,896
And I'm sure
if she was here

140
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:04,032
she'd tell you to listen
to my favorite girl.

141
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,267
Hi, honey!

142
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,836
Fine, but only because
my cold medication

143
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,438
is starting to make
me see double.

144
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,073
- Aw.
- Help--help me. Help.

145
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:12,541
Did you hear that?

146
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:13,942
He thinks
we look like twins.

147
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,944
I don't think that's
what he said.

148
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:17,079
I think he did.

149
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:18,280
What can I
help you with, Mom?

150
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:20,115
Well, my beautiful
baby girl,

151
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:21,883
I am here to
rescue you.

152
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:24,553
After the...

153
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:28,223
B-r-e-a-c-k-u-p,

154
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,392
you could use some
regular socialization,

155
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:33,128
so how about
a leisurely lunch?

156
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,529
Oh, my God. I don't
know what's worse--

157
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:35,731
the fact that you just
spelled out breakup

158
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:36,898
or that you
misspelled it.

159
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,567
- Huh?
- Yeah.

160
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:39,935
- No.
- Mom, I'm fine.

161
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,570
I have a lot
of work to do.

162
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,105
No. Just a quick one,
swe--oh.

163
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,474
Sorry. Is this
a bad time?

164
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:46,875
You people are like
Tribbles today.

165
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:48,076
What's up?
Everything ok with--

166
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,111
Oliver?

167
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:50,545
I was gonna say
your night job,

168
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:51,747
you know, that thing
that you do at night.

169
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:53,148
Yeah, no.
That--that's fine.

170
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,417
Ollie is--is fine, too.

171
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,619
It's actually
about Alex.

172
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:59,154
Um, he's no longer working
on the campaign,

173
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:00,322
so I was--

174
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,757
Oh, my God.
It's Mr. Dennis.

175
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,958
I have a board meeting.

176
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,326
You know what?

177
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:07,329
He's a jerk.
He can wait.

178
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,297
What'd you want to
ask me about Alex?

179
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:14,569
Unh! Ha ha! You know, usually,
someone buys me dinner

180
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,204
before we start
breaking out the cuffs.

181
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:19,107
Ha ha. Heh heh heh.

182
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:21,243
Heh heh.

183
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:22,811
I thought you just
lost your magic,

184
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,746
but your charm seems
to be waning, as well.

185
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:25,947
How the hell
did you get in here?

186
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,949
Heh. I used to be
Ra's Al Ghul.

187
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,985
This I know.
What I'm less clear of

188
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:33,155
is why my resources haven't been
deployed to get me out of here.

189
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:35,724
Well, that's what
I'm here to explain.

190
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,026
Although my time in here might be
limitless, Malcolm,

191
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,461
my patience isn't.

192
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,496
That's cute.

193
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:43,865
As I was saying, I've been in touch
with your resources,

194
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,367
and they don't seem to
have any particular

195
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:46,935
love left for you,
Damien.

196
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:49,971
Something to do
with hocus and pocus

197
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:51,239
and killing
fellow members

198
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:53,041
when you get miffed.

199
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:55,177
HIVE is moving forward
with Genesis

200
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,478
but not with you.

201
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,548
They like you here
out of trouble,

202
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,349
but they do wish you
the best of luck

203
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:02,584
with your trial.

204
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:05,153
Err!

205
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,388
Heh.

206
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,789
Don't be
embarrassed.

207
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,491
Performance issues
are common

208
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,493
for men of your age.

209
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,409
Wow. You really do have eyes in
the back of your head.

210
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:28,643
I thought you had
work to do.

211
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,512
I realized
it could wait.

212
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:32,013
You've been pushing us
pretty hard,

213
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,582
and I know why.

214
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:36,017
Oliver, it's ok
to miss Felicity.

215
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,253
I--I appreciate
what you're doing,

216
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:39,521
but I don't think
that you're the--

217
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:43,225
Person to help you
through it? Why?

218
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,693
Because of what we
used to have?

219
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:45,760
Yeah.

220
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,062
I thought maybe
it just gave me

221
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:48,230
a little insight.

222
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:49,397
Well, I mean,
in fairness,

223
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,933
I did wreck what
we had, too, so...

224
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,369
In your defense,
you were missing

225
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,871
and presumed dead
for 5 years,

226
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:58,507
but that's not
what I mean.

227
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,842
I know how passionately
you love

228
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:04,446
and how much it
hurts once that love goes away.

229
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:07,115
You know, between...

230
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,551
Merlyn, Slade Wilson,
and Ra's Al Ghul,

231
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:13,555
I thought that I'd be a little tougher
than this by now.

232
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:16,191
That's a different
type of pain,

233
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:18,627
and this takes
longer to heal,

234
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,996
but I'm here for you.

235
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:22,230
Thank you.

236
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:28,603
You're not late, Phil.

237
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:31,439
We're still waiting
on Ms. Smoak.

238
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,979
Are you all right?

239
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,849
Phil? Phil?

240
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,185
Phil!

241
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:44,286
Agh!

242
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:46,354
I'm calling 911!

243
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:48,456
I can't get a signal!

244
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,225
Aah!

245
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,961
You'll have to excuse
my tiny friends.

246
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:57,866
Their "beehavior" can be
appalling sometimes...

247
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,570
But it's
a necessary evil.

248
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:04,472
You see, I needed
your full attention.

249
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:06,208
What the hell
do you want?

250
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,009
Straight to the point.

251
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,511
I like that.

252
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:12,747
Your CEO has miraculously
recovered from paralysis

253
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:16,651
thanks to an implantable
biostimulant microchip.

254
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,086
Hand one over,

255
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:21,089
and I'll "bee"
on my way.

256
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,457
There's only
one prototype.

257
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,960
The one
inside Felicity Smoak.

258
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:29,798
So what's a girl got to do
to get on her calendar?

259
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,499
I can talk to Alex
if you want,

260
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,034
but I can't promise
a job he'll be excited about.

261
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,536
Probably best to
keep him away

262
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,937
from a supervillain's
wife.

263
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,874
Yep. You're right
about that.

264
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,376
Hello out there.

265
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,777
What the hell?

266
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm looking
for Felicity Smoak

267
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:47,148
"beecause" it would be swell
if we could chat

268
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,818
about a certain
implantable biochip.

269
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,023
I'm sure your board
would really appreciate it.

270
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:02,628
Brie Larvan!

271
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,929
You know this wackadoodle?

272
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:05,364
I had a run-in
with her last year.

273
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,565
If this Brie Larvan
is coming for you,

274
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,412
we need to get you
out of here.

275
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:08,879
No, no, no. I don't think she
knew who I was.

276
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,047
She's after
something else.

277
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,248
She said something
about an implant.

278
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,449
A biostimulant
microchip.

279
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:13,884
There's only one
working prototype.

280
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:15,085
- Where is it?
- In the base of my spine.

281
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,453
Which brings me back to

282
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:17,888
we need to get you
the hell out of here.

283
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,056
Well, we have to get
everyone out of here!

284
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,390
I can't even get
a signal.

285
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:22,092
She's jammed
all communications.

286
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:23,761
Oh, my God.

287
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,766
Eyewitnesses report

288
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:31,923
the bees have been swarming
the Palmer Tech headquarters

289
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,357
for the past 10 minutes.

290
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:35,736
All communication
in and out of the building

291
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:37,804
has been cut off.
- Have you seen this?

292
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:39,172
I was just there.

293
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:41,675
I'd still be there
if Felicity hadn't--

294
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:43,410
oh, my God.
Felicity.

295
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,984
Gah!

296
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:52,819
You have a 104 fever.
Where do you think you're going?

297
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,354
To get help!

298
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:56,056
I'm pretty sure the police already
know about this.

299
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:58,625
I'm not talking
about the police.

300
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:02,095
We are hearing that
SCPD has sent in an ESU squad.

301
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:03,363
Felicity's in there.

302
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:06,032
Thea, too.
I tried calling but no answer.

303
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,200
She must have already
been inside

304
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:09,069
by the time
the swarm hit.

305
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,405
John's coming in.

306
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,040
This is HIVE, right?

307
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,642
There's no way that
this bee attack is a coincidence.

308
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,043
I don't think
it's HIVE,

309
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:19,579
and I don't think
those are bees.

310
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:22,649
No. Bees don't
give off hundreds

311
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,117
of different kinds
of radio frequencies.

312
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,985
Robot bees. Terrific.

313
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:28,154
Ok. Last year, Felicity
helped Barry Allen

314
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,857
take the bees' inventor--
Brie Larvan.

315
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,158
So it's payback.

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,626
Well, Larvan picked
a hell of a day for it.

317
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,028
Donna is in there, too.

318
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,596
- What?
- She stopped by Felicity's

319
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:38,798
office to, you know,
cheer her up a little.

320
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:42,402
Suit up.

321
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:44,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

322
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,672
The department just
tried sending in an ESU squad.

323
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,040
They couldn't get
through that swarm.

324
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:48,508
Now if their Kevlar
couldn't hold,

325
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,043
what makes you think
that yours will?

326
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,711
We have to try.

327
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,718
I am running out
of patience, Felicity Smoak.

328
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,588
You have 10 minutes
before I start voting

329
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,590
board members out.

330
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:08,661
FYI, my drones pack
a lot more "ow"

331
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:10,630
than your typical sting.

332
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:15,235
Ticktock, ticktock.

333
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,303
Ok. We need to
get out of here.

334
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,072
But, Thea, the bees
are out there.

335
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:21,040
Yeah, and sooner or later,
they're gonna be in here.

336
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,309
Ok. From now on,
I'm buying flats.

337
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,511
I mean, these
assaults are weekly.

338
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:25,712
It's ridiculous.

339
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:26,980
It's just so
not conducive

340
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:28,481
to high fashion.

341
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,452
Ok. Definitely
sooner than later.

342
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:34,087
We're trapped?

343
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,955
Uh, I don't know.

344
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,423
Not exactly.

345
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,225
Ok. Oh, no. I don't
definitely don't have

346
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:40,827
the right shoes
for that.

347
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,295
Oh, no, no, no.

348
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:46,199
Hello?

349
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:52,272
Anybody here?

350
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,909
"Yes, we are here, Curtis,

351
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:57,977
"and we just can't wait
to hear how you used

352
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,445
"the cell phone
that we gave you

353
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,948
"to help us rescue Dr. Palmer

354
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,118
to track us back
to our"...

355
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,325
"Secret lair"!

356
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,526
So we don't need
to take out the bees.

357
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,495
We just need to
take out Larvan.

358
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:17,463
Yeah. Well, it doesn't make much
sense if we can't get inside.

359
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:24,304
Holy frak.

360
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,541
You're the--

361
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,310
and wait--you're--

362
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:32,812
wait, wait, wait--
you're--you're--

363
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:34,514
just so you guys know,
if--if I pass out

364
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:35,915
it's because I'm sick,

365
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,952
not because, you know.

366
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,954
So can anybody
just walk in here?

367
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:49,362
So you're
the infamous Damien Darhk.

368
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:52,298
Oh, I get it.
You're big fans, aren't you?

369
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,133
You want me to pose
for a selfie?

370
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:56,736
Back in Star City,
you were a big deal.

371
00:13:56,738 --> 00:14:01,040
In here, the only big deal
is him.

372
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,009
No, no, no, no,
gentlemen.

373
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,878
I think we're getting
off on the wrong foot.

374
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,679
There must be some sort
of way that we can have--

375
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,082
w-w-wow.

376
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,316
Heh. I'm sorry.
I just got to know

377
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:11,584
did you sew that
in yourself,

378
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:14,153
or do you have some kind
of lip-sewing guy?

379
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,842
How did you
deal with her in the first place?

380
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:38,177
The old-fashioned way--
hacking,

381
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,713
but I can't do that
without a working computer.

382
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:42,715
Ok. Well, at least all we have
to do is wait for Ollie

383
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:43,950
and the rest
of them to get here.

384
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:46,085
Just when I thought
I was out.

385
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,588
I thought I'd left
this all behind.

386
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,656
Hmm.

387
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:52,158
Do you hear that?

388
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,393
Bee.

389
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,501
Make that plural--
bees in the air vent.

390
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,937
Go! Run!

391
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,239
Is that a bee? Aah!

392
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,707
Aah!

393
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:17,884
Curtis.

394
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,953
Oh, this is
so weird.

395
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:21,287
I literally just
had a dream where

396
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,723
you were
the Green Arrow.

397
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,959
Wait. This is
happening?

398
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:27,627
- You're the Green Arrow?!
- Yeah.

399
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,763
I could have sworn it was Neal Adams
in data processing.

400
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,932
And this is
the Arrowcave.

401
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,434
Oh, my God.

402
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:36,502
Actually, we call it
the bunk--it's the bunker,

403
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:37,670
but yeah.

404
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:38,938
You're Laurel Lance,
the ADA.

405
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,506
I--I've seen you
on TV before.

406
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,508
Oh! And you're
Captain Lance!

407
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,711
And you're--
oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,112
I know I've met before,

409
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:47,447
but I can't really place
your name right now.

410
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:48,881
Curtis, that's
John Diggle.

411
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,450
I need you to focus
for a second, please.

412
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:54,120
Oh, my God.
This place is unbelievable.

413
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:56,255
I mean, you guys
must be drawing some crazy electricity.

414
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:59,359
How do you keep it
off the grid?

415
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,862
This is S.T.A.R. Labs'
5000 Exostation.

416
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:03,963
What are the specs
on this?

417
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:04,964
Curtis!

418
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,699
Get it together.

419
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,267
Ok. Now I'm starting to see
the whole Green Arrow thing,

420
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,702
and I'm actually
starting to feel better, too.

421
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:11,170
That's because we
gave you an IV

422
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:12,438
to rehydrate you.

423
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,873
It should keep you going
for a few hours.

424
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,275
Ok. Forget
the how for a second.

425
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:18,111
What are you
doing here?

426
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:19,912
I saw the bee HIVE on the news.
Felicity's in there.

427
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:21,514
Yeah, we're just about
to mount a rescue mission.

428
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,049
Do you guys even
know what that is?

429
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,585
That is an army
of robotic bees.

430
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,487
Yeah. That's my life now.

431
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:30,523
Brie Larvan.
Apparently, she hacked

432
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,225
the prison computer
network

433
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:33,993
and got herself
an early release. Clever.

434
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,962
Feel free to use
that, by the way.

435
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,530
I mean, you can't put me
in front of this beautiful machine

436
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:39,365
and expect me not to take
it for a test drive.

437
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,568
Looks like Felicity keeps
files on various criminals.

438
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,337
Who's the Dodger?

439
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,671
Looks like we have ourselves a taller,
more dude-like version

440
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:46,839
of Felicity.

441
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,341
And I can help.

442
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,877
Now look. These bees,
they're tiny computers, ok?

443
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,345
With Felicity
trapped inside,

444
00:16:52,347 --> 00:16:53,846
you guys are gonna need
someone to hack them,

445
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,548
but I'll have to
"bee" careful.

446
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,051
Ha ha ha!

447
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:00,019
It's too soon
for bee puns, right?

448
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,055
- Let's assume that it is.
- Yeah.

449
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:04,090
Curtis, can you
immobilize enough bees

450
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,658
to give us a way in?

451
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,527
There's only one way
to find out.

452
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,064
Do it.

453
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,365
You want me on the team?!

454
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,934
I mean,
you want me on the team?

455
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,602
Let's go.

456
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:19,205
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

457
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,407
You see now
the value

458
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,242
of my prize,
Mr. Queen?

459
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:25,044
What have you done
to yourself?

460
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:29,482
There are primordial energies
that flow through all things.

461
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,717
I now command them.

462
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,219
You're insane.

463
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:35,088
Heh. Madness is
a matter

464
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,223
of perspective,
Mr. Queen.

465
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:39,092
Your morality blinds you
from understanding

466
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,426
what I
have achieved.

467
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,794
No, I understand.

468
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,896
You're killing people
to gain power.

469
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:46,265
And what would you
do about it?

470
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:49,535
Now tell me where
you have hidden my idol,

471
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:54,474
and I promise
to kill you both quickly.

472
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:56,075
We'll pass.

473
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:02,582
Ohh!

474
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:06,652
Ok. How many
are there?

475
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:08,988
Just try to think
happy thoughts.

476
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:15,495
Ok. Now it's time
to hack some bees.

477
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:19,799
Ok. So that's what
that button does.

478
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,840
Felicity.

479
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,108
Ohh!

480
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,578
Aah! Aah!

481
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,013
Felicity!

482
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:35,281
Curtis?

483
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,449
How do you know
that bee's name?

484
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,651
I did it!
I hacked the--achoo!

485
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,119
Bees!

486
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,321
How did you--
what are you doing there?

487
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:44,824
I know, right?
I am still pinching myself. Heh.

488
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,263
All the bees
are gone.

489
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:51,797
You're welcome.
The Green Arrow is on his way,

490
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,966
as well as Black Canary
and Spartan.

491
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:55,668
How cool is this?

492
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,704
Uh, they'll meet you
at the west utility entrance.

493
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,873
Can you get there?
Did I mention how cool this is?

494
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,111
Curtis, have you
deactivated the bees?

495
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:07,180
Negative.
Uh, I mean, positive.

496
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:09,015
Sorry. I'm nervous.

497
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,383
The bees are down.

498
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,552
Uh-oh.
Oh, it's negative.

499
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:14,086
Negative!
The bees are back!

500
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,055
I--I got kicked out!

501
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,733
Duck! Agh!

502
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,302
Ugh.

503
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,070
Ok, ok, come on.
Go back inside.

504
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,805
Back inside.

505
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,433
What
the hell happened?

506
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:44,701
We couldn't see.
I lost the feed.

507
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,503
He got stung.

508
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,538
Yeah. He's having
some sort of reaction.

509
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,077
He didn't just get stung.

510
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,445
The bee's inside you.

511
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,013
Well, cut it out!

512
00:19:57,015 --> 00:19:58,448
Do you guys have anesthesia
around here or something?

513
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,417
- Curtis, just do it!
- I can't find it.

514
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,953
Ok. Actually--and this
is hard to believe--

515
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:04,955
we have a bigger problem.

516
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:08,758
The bee is replicating
itself inside Oliver.

517
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:13,496
Ok.

518
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:15,432
What did that thing

519
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:16,499
do to the Green Arrow?

520
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:19,202
Stung him badly.

521
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,738
He'll be ok,
and he'll be back.

522
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:23,528
So will the others.

523
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,829
How do you know?

524
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:26,164
They just got
their butts kicked

525
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,067
by that--that--
that bee man.

526
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,501
This is why we leave
the nicknames to Cisco.

527
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:31,736
- Yeah.
- What?

528
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:32,737
Inside joke.

529
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,842
I thought we were
friends, Smoak,

530
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:40,111
that you were gonna
come through.

531
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,748
10 minutes ago,
you had 10 minutes to go.

532
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,684
You're out of time,
glasses.

533
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,753
"Beecause" we got
interrupted,

534
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:50,355
I'm gonna give you
an additional 5 minutes

535
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:54,259
before I start taking your board
members off the board.

536
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:55,727
Ohh.

537
00:20:55,729 --> 00:21:00,565
Oh, and your fiance
looks awfully sweet.

538
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:04,636
Sorry. Ex-fiance.

539
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,104
Ugh!

540
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:08,640
Ok. You cannot
turn yourself in.

541
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,241
No. She'd kill
everyone anyway.

542
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,944
To think,
she's in your office.

543
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:14,879
You're gonna have to
sanitize.

544
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:17,649
Yes. She's in my office,
which is, "A," yes, gross,

545
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,904
but, "B," means she's not
with the board members.

546
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:22,018
You know, since she brought up Oliver,
honey, have you spoken to him--

547
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,085
Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom,
I'm thinking!

548
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:25,587
I'm sorry. You know
what, honey?

549
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:27,789
I'm curious, ok? I--

550
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,357
I have an idea.

551
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,394
It's not working!

552
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:34,062
You did it while we
were at Palmer Tech.

553
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:35,597
The drone has evolved
and adapted since then.

554
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,699
The damn things are
like the Borg.

555
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:39,367
The--the bad guys
in "Star Trek," which--

556
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,100
I wish Felicity
was here.

557
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,564
Well, she's not Curtis!
You are!

558
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:42,774
Now you have to be able
to do something, ok?

559
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,308
When these things hit
critical mass, there's--

560
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,823
it's gonna be like
John Hurt in "Alien"!

561
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:47,157
Sorry. When I get nervous,
I make pop culture references.

562
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,525
Ok. You can't
hack it out.

563
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:49,960
Can you lure it out
like some kind of--

564
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:51,328
I can't believe
I'm saying this--

565
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,590
some kind of digital
honey or something?

566
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:55,111
Not exactly, but if these are
really modeled after bees, then...

567
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:58,374
They'll operate  on a singular frequency
to orientate themselves.

568
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:01,010
If we can disrupt it,
then we can disperse the colony.

569
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:03,346
Only problem is that we need to generate
a high enough frequency

570
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,548
to damage the network,
but unless you guys have

571
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,118
a portable sonic projector
handy, then--

572
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,653
What?

573
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:15,591
This technology's
amazing.

574
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:17,493
It reads your own
vocal emissions

575
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:19,695
and then reprocesses it
via digital output into a multichannel.

576
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:21,130
Yeah, we get it.
It's badass,

577
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,499
but how is this
gonna help us save Oliver?

578
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:24,767
Just give him
the full Mariah Carey,

579
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:26,202
and it should disrupt
whatever connection

580
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:27,937
the bees are
operating on.

581
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,106
You sure
about this?

582
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:33,109
Err. Don't have time
to be sure.

583
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:35,211
Curtis, do it!

584
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:38,081
3, 2, 1.

585
00:22:57,969 --> 00:23:02,271
That...Was...Awesome.

586
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:08,878
You son of a bitch!

587
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:29,432
My victory's inevitable,
Mr. Queen.

588
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:31,501
Just think.
All of this power came

589
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:34,137
from the life essence
of one man.

590
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:35,638
Imagine
what I will become

591
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,108
when dozens of lives
are sacrificed in my name.

592
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,177
You'll become
a monster.

593
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,380
No. A God.

594
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,815
Let me show you.

595
00:23:57,162 --> 00:23:58,995
Unh!

596
00:23:58,997 --> 00:24:00,963
No. I need more.

597
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,301
You get them?

598
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:06,536
Yeah. They were
in Curtis' office

599
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:07,904
right where you said
they'd be.

600
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,273
Uh, no pun intended.

601
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,374
Whoa! So this is
like that thing

602
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:12,475
from that, uh--

603
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:13,643
that Jodie Foster
movie!

604
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,278
Yeah. A panic room.

605
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,779
It's actually more
like a lair, decommissioned,

606
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:18,047
but if we can get
the board members in there,

607
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:19,515
then they can escape
through a secret exit.

608
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:21,250
Secret exit?

609
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,818
Um, don't you think
you should have thought of that,

610
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,354
like, I don't know,
15 minutes ago.

611
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:27,623
Oh, I'm sorry. I was busy trying
not to die,

612
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,492
and you were
talking, talking, talking.

613
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:31,027
Well, you don't open
up to me, Hon.

614
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,728
I have to force your feelings out
of you sometimes

615
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,565
like--like
a pistachio.

616
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,667
Ok, Smoaks.
We got to go. Come on.

617
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:41,103
Felicity.

618
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,405
Mom!

619
00:24:42,407 --> 00:24:46,776
I meant Felicity!
Aah!

620
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,312
Aah!

621
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:51,147
- Ohh.
- Ok. We're moving.

622
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:52,348
I know. Hold
on to something.

623
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,950
- What? Why?
- Why?

624
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,885
This elevator only stops
at the sublevel,

625
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,420
and we need it to
stop at the--

626
00:24:57,422 --> 00:24:59,388
Aah!

627
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,790
Conference room
floor.

628
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,228
Um, I think we
missed our stop.

629
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,029
Nope. This is right.

630
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,664
Like I said, the elevator doesn't
stop at this level.

631
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:11,667
What? Um, honey,
I think this is a concrete wall.

632
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:13,302
Yeah, and these are
explosive devices.

633
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,071
Actually, they're autonomous
communication devices.

634
00:25:15,073 --> 00:25:16,872
I'm just really hoping that Curtis
hasn't figured out

635
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:19,208
how to stop them
from exploding yet.

636
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,443
- Oh.
- Careful.

637
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:21,911
Ok.

638
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,414
Oh, my God!
Is it gonna be loud?

639
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,616
Oh! Aah!

640
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:37,393
Ok. Who wants
to go on a secret elevator ride

641
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:38,861
down to the, um,
panic room?

642
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:40,396
Yeah.
The panic room.

643
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,068
Trying to escape
the HIVE?

644
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:50,506
Keep them safe.

645
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,875
What? What?!

646
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:02,548
Beautiful creatures
my bees.

647
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,582
They obey you.

648
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,150
Neural implants.

649
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:07,953
You used to control them the
old-fashioned way.

650
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:10,422
How did you know that?

651
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:11,924
Lucky guess, I guess.

652
00:26:11,926 --> 00:26:13,325
So why bees?

653
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:16,128
Why not an obsession with
flying squirrels?

654
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,665
Squirrels aren't dying off
at a rate of 30% per year,

655
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,300
and nobody cares,

656
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:23,101
but bees are essential
to life.

657
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,570
We're all connected.

658
00:26:24,572 --> 00:26:27,339
The world is one
giant honeycomb.

659
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:29,041
That "Kumbaya" might
have a little more credibility

660
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,709
if you weren't
threatening people's lives.

661
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:33,145
What, you mean
like this?

662
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:34,646
I am running out
of patience,

663
00:26:34,648 --> 00:26:36,582
and your friend is running
out of time.

664
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:38,150
Now give me the damn--

665
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:44,756
That was embarrassing.

666
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:50,963
I have a tumor
on my L4 vertebrae.

667
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:55,000
The tricky little guy's
wrapped around my spinal cord.

668
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,936
The only way to cut it
out involves a surgery

669
00:26:57,938 --> 00:26:59,838
that will leave me
paralyzed

670
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,974
from the waist down.

671
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:06,345
All the bees in the world couldn't
get a cripple to walk,

672
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:09,948
and then I read
about your miracle chip.

673
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,024
Of course, I couldn't
afford it.

674
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:13,324
Maybe if you
asked nicely.

675
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:14,991
I want the microchip
specs,

676
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:17,194
or your friend relives
my favorite scene from "My Girl."

677
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:19,596
Ok, honey.
We all have a sad sob story,

678
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,531
but killing people
doesn't fix anything.

679
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:27,036
The blueprints are on a remote
hard drive in Curtis Holt's lab.

680
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:28,671
You are a smart girl.

681
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:38,113
Elastic nanotubes,
ultrasonic motors,

682
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,381
piezoceramic elements.

683
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,584
I mean, this bee's
got everything.

684
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:43,052
That was inside me?

685
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:45,554
Well, that and thousands
of its microscopic larvae.

686
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:48,357
Don't worry. Should pass
in a few days.

687
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,692
Can't wait.

688
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:51,260
Donna and the others
made it out.

689
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:52,528
Thea and Felicity?

690
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,996
They're still
inside.

691
00:27:53,998 --> 00:27:55,831
Well, at least now
we know this stops the bees.

692
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,266
I wish it was that simple,
but now that we've

693
00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:58,534
played that card,
they've undoubtedly

694
00:27:58,536 --> 00:27:59,869
adapted to it,

695
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:02,171
but we just beat a group
of robot bees

696
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:03,505
using a superhero
doohickey,

697
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:04,540
and if that's
not high-five-worthy,

698
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,841
I don't know what is.

699
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:08,277
Curtis, now is not
the time for high-fives.

700
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,379
Sorry. I--you know,
I just got excited,

701
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,148
and, you know, you got to celebrate
the wins when they come.

702
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,217
What?

703
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,353
Thea and Felicity
are still trapped

704
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:18,687
inside Palmer Tech with who knows
how many more bees.

705
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:20,256
- We're not winning.
- Oliver.

706
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:21,357
So if you're gonna
be down here,

707
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,691
if you're gonna be
with us,

708
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:24,093
then you need to
understand the totality

709
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:25,294
of what it is you're
signing up for.

710
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:27,263
If we do not do
our jobs perfectly,

711
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:28,697
then people die

712
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:29,932
and not just
strangers

713
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:32,034
but friends, family,
and loved ones,

714
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,103
so think about that
every time you crack a joke

715
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:36,405
or make light
of what it is that we do!

716
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:38,307
Hey.

717
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:40,643
Can I talk to you
for a second?

718
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,751
Any puppies you want to
kick while you're at it,

719
00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:51,887
bags of kittens that
you want to throw down the river?

720
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:53,122
He needed
to hear that.

721
00:28:53,124 --> 00:28:55,724
Nobody needs to
hear that, Oliver.

722
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:57,760
I know you're hurting,
but you can't take it out on Curtis.

723
00:28:57,762 --> 00:28:59,061
I'm not taking it
out on Curtis.

724
00:28:59,063 --> 00:29:00,930
I just need him
to see.

725
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:01,931
See what?

726
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:04,733
That this is not
a good life.

727
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:06,669
I walked away
from it,

728
00:29:06,671 --> 00:29:09,738
and I was happy.

729
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,710
For the first time
in 8 years,

730
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,845
I was content.

731
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,747
So why did you
come back?

732
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:20,716
I came back because
of Felicity.

733
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,618
She convinced me
that we could do this job,

734
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,454
that we could save
this city and not

735
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:27,890
surrender
to the darkness,

736
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,526
but...

737
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:32,962
I don't--I don't
think that we can.

738
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:34,563
You're only saying
that right now

739
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,700
because you're
in 10 different kinds of pain,

740
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:41,003
but the harsh truth
is that Felicity--

741
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,139
she broke up with you
because of your choices,

742
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:45,774
because lies that
you told,

743
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:47,409
you--Oliver,
not the Green Arrow.

744
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,980
I know.

745
00:29:50,982 --> 00:29:52,481
It just doesn't
seem fair

746
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:53,682
that I can save
a city

747
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:54,817
and not save
my relationship.

748
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:58,220
Oliver,
life's not fair,

749
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:02,091
whether you're
in Star City or Ivy Town,

750
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,393
but you're right.

751
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:08,230
You can save this city,
you do it every night.

752
00:30:08,232 --> 00:30:11,734
You're a beacon
of hope to people.

753
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:13,302
I just wish that you
would try and use

754
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:15,337
some of that hope
for yourself.

755
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,019
Oh, hi, fellas.

756
00:30:30,021 --> 00:30:31,520
You know, I usually
frown upon walk-ins,

757
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,989
but how can I
help you?

758
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:35,257
No guards are coming to
save you this time, Darhk.

759
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,825
We made sure of it.

760
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:39,661
Good because then
he only has to kill two of you.

761
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,633
Heh heh heh.

762
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,035
I know you're
probably asking yourself,

763
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:48,670
"self, what the hell
just happened?"

764
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:50,539
It turns out your friend,
my new friend,

765
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:53,075
Mr. Amar has
a soft spot

766
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:54,243
for his only
surviving relative,

767
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,678
a grandmother
in Monument Point.

768
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,380
It is amazing what
people will tell you

769
00:30:58,382 --> 00:31:01,583
with a few phone calls
and a kind voice.

770
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:04,019
Anyway--are they dead?
Are they dead?

771
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:06,355
No! I had this
wonderful speech

772
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:07,922
about how I was gonna
kill your grandmother

773
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:09,726
had you not killed them.

774
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:12,928
Never mind.
On to other matters.

775
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,763
You may now call
your organization

776
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:17,433
and have that other
message delivered.

777
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:23,305
Heh heh heh.

778
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:27,042
I thought we were
locked out.

779
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:29,144
Well, we're gonna have
to see if I haven't lost my touch.

780
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:30,712
Then I have to see
if my mom

781
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,448
and the board members
made it to safety.

782
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,616
You really should not
have given Brie what she wanted.

783
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:37,319
I am sick of people being put in
vulnerable positions.

784
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:38,921
Yeah. Well, now there's
nothing stopping her

785
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:41,056
from bringing those
bee things back on us.

786
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:46,128
Well, at the very least, it buys us--
the team-- your team time.

787
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,464
Ollie's gonna be fine.

788
00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:49,731
He always is.

789
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,467
Well, unfortunately,
in Oliver's case,

790
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:54,002
"he always is" isn't an accurate
predictive metric.

791
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:56,004
Sorry. I'm just sick
of worrying,

792
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,140
I'm sick
of the violence.

793
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:00,642
Yeah. So am I, ok?
Of course I am,

794
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,377
but we put up
with it.

795
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,846
We push past it

796
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:06,648
because what we do
is important, ok?

797
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,651
We have to be
the beacon of hope.

798
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:11,120
Nobody else is.

799
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:13,088
You're the beacon
of hope.

800
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,357
I quit the team because
I couldn't stand to work with Oliver,

801
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,327
but--but now that
I'm out,

802
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:20,129
I look at life from a different
perspective.

803
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:21,763
I mean, look around you.

804
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,133
Thea, we're in a "Die Hard"
movie with bees.

805
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:25,934
Maybe I'm meant for great things,
maybe I'm not,

806
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:29,171
but whatever it is,
it's not this.

807
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:32,374
I'm sorry.
I'm not coming back.

808
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:38,280
Curtis.

809
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:39,681
You know,
I'm beginning to see

810
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:41,884
why you and Felicity
didn't work out.

811
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,519
I probably deserve that.

812
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:45,020
Look. I'm all for hugs
and learning,

813
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:46,922
but like you said,
there's still danger.

814
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:47,990
Yeah.

815
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:49,992
And you are
a very scary man.

816
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:51,960
Any luck
with the bees?

817
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,896
Curtis is doing
his best.

818
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:55,364
Thanks, Laurel.
Now that I've been able

819
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:56,965
to actually
examine the bee,

820
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,867
I've deciphered
their upgrade protocol.

821
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:01,003
Next time they adapt,
I can upload a virus

822
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,437
that will disperse
into the entire HIVE.

823
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,374
Like what they did
in "Independence Day," right?

824
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:07,075
What, I can't watch
movies, too?

825
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:08,577
So what's the plan?

826
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:11,747
I rigged an arrow
with a computer virus payload.

827
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:13,715
Shoot it near one
of "bee" Arthur's minions,

828
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:15,517
the virus will transmit
to the rest of the colony,

829
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,920
and we're done.

830
00:33:17,922 --> 00:33:20,189
That's nice work.

831
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:22,191
Uh...

832
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:24,526
Wait until it works
before you congratulate me.

833
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:25,861
I'm in!
I mean, I'm out.

834
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:27,796
I mean, I have
Internet.

835
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,064
Mom and the board members,
they're ok.

836
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:30,399
What about us?

837
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm working on
overriding the bees,

838
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:33,235
the ones that are
outside guarding the building.

839
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,770
Don't bother.

840
00:33:37,274 --> 00:33:39,107
These blueprints
will be useful.

841
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:40,242
Thanks for those.

842
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:41,443
You have what you want,

843
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,111
so go build it yourself.

844
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:44,613
I think we're confused.

845
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:46,248
To get the schematics,
I had to tip-toe

846
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,550
through Palmer Tech's
computer network,

847
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:53,188
and I saw some
very familiar computer code.

848
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,292
You never forget the hacker
who sent you to prison.

849
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:58,694
Hi.

850
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:05,034
We're clear.

851
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:06,736
At least there's no
signs of the bees.

852
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:13,443
Go!

853
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:21,250
Looks like your green friend didn't
forget about you.

854
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,091
Never will.

855
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:29,092
Hey. Are you hurt?

856
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,093
I'm ok.

857
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,094
Hey! Behind you!

858
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:34,564
There you go.

859
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:37,233
Team Arrow, which I am now
a member of--pinch me--

860
00:34:37,235 --> 00:34:40,002
I need a few more minutes
to hack this latest firewall.

861
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:41,571
The bees adapted.

862
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:47,009
I thought you were
a better shot.

863
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:48,277
Hey!

864
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:07,663
All right. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

865
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:09,499
- Gotcha!
- Nice!

866
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:11,667
What is that?

867
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:15,404
Whoa!

868
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,106
Oh, my God!

869
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,479
Aah!

870
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:57,914
Aah! Aah!

871
00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:00,716
Oh, oh, oh!

872
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:03,152
Yah! Yah!

873
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,657
Eww!

874
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:09,759
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone you screamed.

875
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:11,260
Oh, right!

876
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,870
Thank you.

877
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:24,507
You never, never
have to thank me.

878
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,177
Agh!

879
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:31,380
If I can't walk,
you can't live.

880
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:37,220
Who should I kill first,

881
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:40,223
"A" or "Bee"?

882
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,759
Guess who's back in control.

883
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:46,696
It's me Curtis in case you guys
don't recognize my voice yet.

884
00:36:46,698 --> 00:36:51,367
Uh. Unh! No, no!

885
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,609
Ha ha!
Lay down, "Bee-yotch"!

886
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:01,277
Heh heh.

887
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:03,412
Too on the nose?

888
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:16,559
Oh. Ah. The bee
came alive,

889
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:18,494
and, well, things
got a little out of hand,

890
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:20,363
but don't worry--
it's dead now.

891
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,465
You did good, Curtis,

892
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:26,569
and I'm--I'm sorry if I
made you feel differently.

893
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:29,438
Thanks, G.A. Heh.
Do you mind if I call you G.A.?

894
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,607
All right. Yeah.
I'll just stick to Oliver then.

895
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:33,009
Or Mr. Queen.

896
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:34,677
What about Larvan?
What's gonna happen to her?

897
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,178
She's
at Starling General,

898
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,613
overdosed on toxins
from the bee

899
00:37:37,615 --> 00:37:39,215
and is in some sort
of a coma.

900
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:40,616
More importantly,
she's no longer holding

901
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:42,451
a dozen innocent
hostages.

902
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:45,621
That's both comforting
and horrifying at the same time.

903
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:46,922
Yeah. Welcome
to our world.

904
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:49,992
Hey. Is everything
all right?

905
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:53,329
Yeah. You know, I should probably
just head home.

906
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:55,464
You know, learning
that you're, you know, you

907
00:37:55,466 --> 00:37:57,600
and the murderous bees
and this coma news,

908
00:37:57,602 --> 00:37:59,335
it's just a lot
to digest,

909
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:01,937
plus that IV you gave me
is starting to wear off.

910
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:04,707
Well, you are always
welcome here, Curtis.

911
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:06,242
Just keep
the property damage

912
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,678
to a minimum next time.

913
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,679
Ok.

914
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:11,147
All right.

915
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:13,015
- What's the exit?
- Right there.

916
00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:14,417
Oh, yeah. Ahem.

917
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,655
Hey. Nice apology.

918
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:23,459
Well, I'm just trying
to be a beacon of hope

919
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:25,661
and, like you said,
save a little bit

920
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:27,930
of the hope
for myself.

921
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:34,437
Taiana. Hey! Hey!

922
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,105
All right. All right.

923
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,674
Jeez. Come on, come on.

924
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:40,743
Oh, thank God.
Taiana, wake up.

925
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:43,379
- Hey.
- Oliver.

926
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:44,547
It's ok. You're ok.

927
00:38:44,549 --> 00:38:46,515
- No.
- It's all right.

928
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:50,352
Reiter--he's gone!

929
00:38:50,354 --> 00:38:53,122
He must be in the tunnels
searching for his idol.

930
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,724
We can't let him find it.

931
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:56,392
If he's in the tunnels
searching for his idol,

932
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:58,994
that means he's not
going to the prison.

933
00:38:58,996 --> 00:39:01,230
This is our chance
to save your friends.

934
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:03,232
And what
of Reiter's men?

935
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:05,101
They're still up there.

936
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,907
That's why we're gonna
kill all of them first.

937
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:23,552
I don't suppose it's
too late to reheat that soup.

938
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:24,920
Where have you been?

939
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:26,756
You bolted out of here
like a crazy person,

940
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:30,059
like some kind of a superhero off
to save the day.

941
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:31,560
I was chasing some
silly fantasy that

942
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:33,696
I could help
the police.

943
00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:36,132
It was scary and thrilling
and dangerous

944
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:37,900
and did I mention
scary?

945
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:41,103
The point is is that
I saw enough

946
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:44,940
to know that this
is where I belong--

947
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:47,943
at home with you.

948
00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:50,246
So no more
disappearing acts?

949
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:51,580
I promise.

950
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:55,217
Let's get you some
of that soup.

951
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:59,488
Terrific.

952
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,657
Ahh. Maybe I should
burn some incense

953
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:02,792
in here or something.

954
00:40:02,794 --> 00:40:04,660
Yeah. That's
probably

955
00:40:04,662 --> 00:40:06,395
a very good idea.

956
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:11,233
Remind me to never
wear black and yellow ever again.

957
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:12,735
Wait. Where'd
your mom go?

958
00:40:12,737 --> 00:40:14,737
Oh! Captain Lance
drove her home.

959
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:17,006
Yeah. That is something I'll never
be able to wrap my brain around.

960
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:20,442
Eh, it's kind of cute.

961
00:40:20,444 --> 00:40:22,778
Don't you miss this?

962
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,480
I mean, I know you
said that you wanted

963
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:26,515
to get away
from it all,

964
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:29,819
but how could you?

965
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:31,153
What do you mean?

966
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:34,089
This. The--
the thrill of this, the rush.

967
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:37,293
I mean, we just took down a bad
"Bee-yotch" tonight.

968
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:38,994
It doesn't get any
better than this.

969
00:40:38,996 --> 00:40:45,334
I was never in it
for that, not ever.

970
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:46,969
I wanted to
make a difference,

971
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:50,206
be a part of that
beacon of hope you speak of.

972
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,408
So come back.

973
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,777
Rejoin the team.

974
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:57,646
I think I figured out
another way.

975
00:40:57,648 --> 00:41:00,349
It was actually that
insane bee lady

976
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:02,384
who gave me the idea,
ironically...

977
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:06,488
To remake this company

978
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,224
to use the technology
that helped me walk again

979
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:10,526
to make people's
lives better,

980
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:15,197
to make Palmer Tech
into the beacon of hope.

981
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:22,538
Our mutual friends
in HIVE have abandoned

982
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,407
our other mutual friend
Mr. Darhk,

983
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:28,043
but he reached out
to me,

984
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:30,145
told me about you.

985
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:33,649
He said you were
his ace in the hole.

986
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:38,520
Heh heh. Is that what
you'd like me to call you,

987
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:41,624
or do you prefer
Mr. Diggle?

988

989
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,709
Greg!
Move your head.
