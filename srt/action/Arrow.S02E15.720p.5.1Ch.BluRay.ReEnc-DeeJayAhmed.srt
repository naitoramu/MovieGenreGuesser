2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,709
My name is Oliver Queen.

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,876
After five years on a hellish island...

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,487
I have come home with only one goal:

5
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,058
To save my city.

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,683
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,231
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,736
I must be something else.

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,105
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:32,767
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

11
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,345
- You got what you came for!
- Time's up.

12
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,096
- No!
- I guess you made your choice.

13
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,508
No!

14
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,947
Ivo killed Shade because of me.

15
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,348
Nothing good comes from telling Slade
you think you're responsible...

16
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,461
for the death of the woman he loved.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,500
The man who killed Shado
is still out there.

18
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,589
Not for long,
because we're gonna take the freighter.

19
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,629
We're all gonna die here.

20
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,233
Just like him.

21
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,233
No, we're not.
I think I found our way onto the freighter.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,265
Parachute.

23
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,935
- I'd like you to meet Slade Wilson.
- It's a pleasure to meet you...

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,215
Mr. Queen.

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,316
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,919
Mr. Wilson just made a sizable contribution
to my campaign.

27
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,323
How generous of him.

28
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:31,092
Well, I felt compelled. And it was the
least that I could do for your mother.

29
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:35,001
What this city needs
is a pro-business mayor like Moira...

30
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,733
to spur growth through urban investment.

31
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,607
And we were just discussing
how to combat the rising wage gap.

32
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,750
And the answer lies
in your budget proposal.

33
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,982
You know, when I look at your mother...

34
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,179
I think about everything you
went through after the quake.

35
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,791
All I can say is,
you and I have something in common.

36
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,324
What's that?

37
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,292
I know how difficult it is
to pick yourself back up...

38
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,591
when other people have written you off.

39
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,428
Indeed.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,798
What's wrong, Mr. Queen?

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,464
You look a little piqued.

42
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,877
I'm fine, thank you.

43
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,947
Ah. Thank you, dear.

44
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:26,388
Oliver, Mr. Wilson was kind enough to bring
a bottle of authentic Australian rum.

45
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,295
Will you join us in a drink?

46
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,388
Yes, of course.

47
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,363
Wonderful.

48
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,731
What shall we drink to?

49
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,179
To friendship.

50
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,039
Ah. Delicious.

51
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:59,509
Uh, this here is a beautiful piece.

52
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:04,319
Tell me, does your family spend
much time on the water?

53
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,758
No.

54
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,264
Not since my late husband.

55
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,695
I'm sorry, Moira. Forgive me.

56
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,067
I do remember reading about that accident
in the paper.

57
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,503
You were a brave soul.

58
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,336
I don't like to talk about it.

59
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,412
I can understand.

60
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,574
All that time on that island.
It must have been hell for you.

61
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,774
- Shado would be proud.
- Thank you.

62
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,743
But those trees don't move or shoot back.

63
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,247
Ivo's men on the freighter will.

64
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,476
Then shoot first.

65
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,760
Ivo's freighter is located here.
He keeps eight men on deck.

66
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,696
Three on the starboard,
three on the port and two up on the bridge.

67
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,928
But our bigger concern
are these GP-25 grenade launchers...

68
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,903
that they're walking
around with at all times.

69
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,121
Do they have night vision?

70
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,470
Not according to Blondie.

71
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,637
That smells awful.

72
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,785
- It'll taste even worse.
- But it'll work?

73
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,150
I spent a year with Anthony Ivo.
I know how he thinks.

74
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,346
It'll work.

75
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,956
Hey, what about the Mirakuru?

76
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,694
- What about it?
- Well, look, I mean, it can cure...

77
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,565
I don't know, maybe anything.

78
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,503
Maybe... maybe it's a miracle drug.

79
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,811
But it's also something else.

80
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:40,143
Something that people like Ivo
should never be allowed to control.

81
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,516
What about Slade? He might not let us.

82
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,214
Might not let you do what?

83
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,983
You think we should destroy the Mirakuru.

84
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,863
If this thing doesn't go our way...

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,661
we can't let Ivo have it.

86
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,401
You're right.

87
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,505
We should burn it.

88
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,273
Anthony devoted his
entire life to finding this.

89
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,581
Nobody even thought it was real.

90
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,278
It was his dream.

91
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,215
Did he ever say why?

92
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,753
He wanted to save the world.

93
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,121
We need to talk about tomorrow.

94
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,088
About what to do with Anthony
once we take the freighter.

95
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,597
What do you mean?

96
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,293
Slade wants to kill him.

97
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm not gonna let that happen.

98
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,039
No, Slade wants to kill him for Shado.

99
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,303
Oliver, you don't know him like I do.

100
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,971
Look, if he's given the chance,
then he's gonna turn this around.

101
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,947
He's gonna make Slade think
that it's your fault that she's dead.

102
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,117
That you chose to save me instead of her.

103
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,552
You can't give him that chance.

104
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,590
- Sara, I can't.
- You've killed before.

105
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,496
That's not what you are talking about.
You are talking...

106
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,160
about executing somebody in cold blood.

107
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,170
Look, Slade has the Mirakuru in him.
He's unstable.

108
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,573
If he loses control, if he snaps again,
then we're both dead.

109
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,680
You have to kill Ivo.

110
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,189
Who's thirsty?

111
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,764
- Where'd you get that?
- Who cares? Let's drink it.

112
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:40,269
Ah, this is one of the few precious pieces
of cargo to survive the crash.

113
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:44,102
Billy Wintergreen and I were planning
on saving it for a rainy day.

114
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:49,680
But considering, God willing,
this is our last night on the island...

115
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,951
To taking the freighter.

116
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,780
To getting off this island forever.

117
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,983
To Shado.

118
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,023
Mm.

119
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,332
You know, if something happens
to me tomorrow...

120
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,468
You can't think like that.

121
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,140
If I don't make it...

122
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,905
I need you to...

123
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,977
To tell my mom and my sister...

124
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:30,713
that I wasn't that same stupid kid
who got on that boat.

125
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,328
Tell them I was different.

126
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,497
Okay.

127
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,829
Hey, and if I don't make it...

128
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,326
tell my family that
I died on the Gambit.

129
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,367
Why?

130
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,701
Let them remember me the way that I was.

131
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,915
We should all get some sleep.

132
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,594
I've missed you.

133
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,296
Shado?

134
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,730
How are you still alive?

135
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,773
I'm not alive.

136
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,068
Remember?

137
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,872
I'm dead.

138
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,085
Because you chose Sara over me.

139
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,557
Why didn't you choose me?

140
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,761
Why didn't you choose me?

141
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,419
Why didn't you choose me?

142
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,070
Rise and shine, kid. it's time.

143
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,862
Better luck next time, Hendrik.

144
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,064
You cheat.

145
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,534
He cheats.

146
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,674
So do you.

147
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,371
He just cheats better.

148
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,741
Get up, preacher boy.

149
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,247
I said, get up, coward.

150
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,543
Ivo wants to see you.

151
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,442
Have faith, my friend.
God will protect you.

152
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,918
There is no God.

153
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,279
If there was...

154
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,890
he's not on this ship.

155
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,892
- How is she?
- I'm sorry, Anthony.

156
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,292
I wish I had better news to give you...

157
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,401
but her condition is progressing quicker
than we anticipated.

158
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,629
Have you tried upping her dosage?

159
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:13,301
Twice already, but we both know
that modern medicine has its limitations.

160
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,104
Oh, yes, I know quite well.

161
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,945
Thank you, doctor.

162
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,322
No. No, wait. Wait, Mr. Ivo.
My family is Bratva, Russian mafia.

163
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,796
They pay millions for me.

164
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,834
I'm sorry. I have very
little use for money.

165
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:45,136
I do, however, require an eye
for my research.

166
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,333
No.

167
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,476
Well, we don't have all day.

168
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,875
There's a breeze.

169
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:57,012
They're on the beach. Take them. Alive.

170
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,342
What about him?

171
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,549
Eh.

172
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,018
They're coming. Two men. Armed.

173
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,893
You know, when we first tried
to get off this island...

174
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,362
it was as strangers.

175
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,667
But now it's as brothers.

176
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,935
See you on the freighter.

177
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,052
There!

178
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,973
You're lucky Ivo wants you alive.

179
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,809
I told you I'd come back.

180
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:10,921
Fantastic. We're saved.

181
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,964
He likes you.

182
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,500
Don't worry. He won't bite.

183
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,239
Reverend Thomas Flynn.

184
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,839
Oliver Queen.

185
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,310
And this is Abraham.

186
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,678
I remember you from before. You escaped.

187
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,415
- With that blond whore.
- That's Hendrik.

188
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,859
- He's a charmer.
- Yeah, I hope she rots in hell.

189
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,122
Hey, Sara was a prisoner.

190
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,664
Just like all of us.

191
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:00,531
Right. Funny, I never heard her scream.

192
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,805
- How long have you been here, Thomas?
- A little over a year.

193
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,045
I was working as a missionary in Maliku
just off the coast of India.

194
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,183
A ship docked there for supplies.

195
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:18,778
Dr. Ivo asked me to come aboard
to administer last rights for a dying man.

196
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,057
- My mistake.
- I'm sorry.

197
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,358
Don't be.

198
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,293
Can you imagine a better place
for a man in my line of work?

199
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,868
Hey, prochnost.

200
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,410
Mr. Queen.

201
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,415
Welcome back.

202
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,919
My men are still searching the beach
for your friend and Sara.

203
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,419
They have the Mirakuru.

204
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,756
So where are they?

205
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,227
You go to hell.

206
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,425
Maybe you'd like to rethink that.

207
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:17,204
Ivo, you torture me all you want to,
I am never gonna tell you where they are.

208
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,611
No, not willingly.

209
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,115
What is that?

210
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,791
Oh, this? See, this is sodium pentothal.

211
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,755
Its more colloquial,
yet very descriptive name...

212
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,788
is "truth serum."

213
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,797
Wait, no. Wait, wait.
I'll tell you everything!

214
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,269
Let's begin.

215
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,133
Are you married, Mr. Wilson?

216
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,242
Do you have any children?

217
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,103
Certainly neither.

218
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,974
Well, there must be someone special
in your life.

219
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,255
There was.

220
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,618
But she passed away a few years ago.

221
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,983
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:07,325
My mother and I have had to deal
with a lot of loss, unfortunately.

223
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,262
And eventually we learned...

224
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,961
that you just have to move on.

225
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,333
I don't believe that.

226
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,838
You know, I heard that your family
has an affinity with the fine arts.

227
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:30,682
Yes, my husband amassed quite the collection
of 19th century American landscapes.

228
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,686
- I'd love to see them.
- Maybe another day.

229
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,685
Ahem. We have some family business
that we need to discuss right now.

230
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,953
I'm sorry.

231
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,692
My son seems to have forgotten
all his manners. Heh.

232
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,530
Let me just get my staff
to open up the rest of the house.

233
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,330
Thank you.

234
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,538
Mom?

235
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,873
Ollie?

236
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,710
Not yet, kid.

237
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,716
I'm still to meet the rest of your family.

238
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,618
Hello?

239
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,796
Hey, Ollie, have you and Mom talked?
Because this whole not speaking thing...

240
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,471
- Thea, now is not a good time.
- Who is your friend?

241
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,870
Slade Wilson.

242
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,883
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You know, I've heard

243
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,813
such wonderful things from your mother.
Heh, heh.

244
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,711
- About me? Heh.
- Thea.

245
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,043
What perfect timing.
This is Slade Wilson...

246
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,158
They've met.

247
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:37,041
And I was about to
show him our collection.

248
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,180
- But you're far better suited. Come.
- Oh. Heh, heh.

249
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,222
Senior year, I was obsessed with art.

250
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:50,094
My teacher made me bring my entire art
history class over here to show our pieces.

251
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,327
It was exactly as mortifying as it sounds.

252
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,439
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't. You're a very
lucky girl to have known such privilege.

253
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,543
And I'm fortunate
to have your entire family here. Heh.

254
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,774
Oliver?

255
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,856
Oliver, what's your name?

256
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,090
Oliver Jonas Queen.

257
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,791
Oliver, where were you born?

258
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,634
Starling City.

259
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,105
Why did you build a bonfire on the beach?

260
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,104
So you'd see it.

261
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,637
I told you.

262
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,774
Was the bonfire a trap?

263
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,151
Not a trap. It was a...

264
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,488
A distraction.

265
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,159
How was the bonfire a distraction?

266
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,960
Where are Sara and Slade right now?

267
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,330
Where are they?

268
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,500
They're on the freighter.

269
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,273
Where on the freighter?

270
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,472
They're in the engine room,
because we have a raft.

271
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,712
Sound the alarm. I want every man
on this freighter down in that engine room.

272
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,686
Search the entire floor. Go.

273
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,616
Oliver Jonas Queen.

274
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,088
You're with me.

275
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,428
Secure all decks!

276
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,358
It'll taste even worse.

277
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,528
But it'll work.

278
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,038
I spent a year with Anthony Ivo.
I know how he thinks. It'll work.

279
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,870
And what is it, exactly?

280
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,036
Cocculus indicus.
It's a natural source of picrotoxin...

281
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,705
which will counteract
the effects of barbiturates.

282
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,215
- Like sodium pentothal.
- Ivo's favorite.

283
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,315
But you still gotta
act stoned to sell it.

284
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Lucky for me...

285
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,379
before all this,
I had a lot of practice.

286
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,663
They're clearing the deck.

287
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,235
The top of the ship's empty.

288
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,398
Are you ready?

289
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,872
You really don't want
an honest answer to that.

290
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,738
You've done this before, right?

291
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,402
- Nobody's done this before.
- Aah!

292
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,091
Here. I think these belong to you.

293
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,429
We're on a clock,
and she needs to free the prisoners.

294
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,070
Ivo sent his men to the engine room
just like we planned.

295
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,934
More convenient for me to take them out.

296
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,431
Go find Ivo.

297
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,439
He can't get off this ship.

298
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,609
But don't kill him.

299
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,947
That son of a bitch is mine.

300
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:00,515
And here we have a Curtis Swan from 1882.

301
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,888
Fun fact about this one. He actually
painted it with his left hand...

302
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,461
due to severe arthritis.

303
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,799
- It's absolutely exquisite.
- Mm-hm.

304
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,927
I can't tell you how many offers we've had
from private collectors for it.

305
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:19,804
But it was one of Dad's favorites.
Wasn't it, Ollie?

306
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,775
Yes, it was.

307
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,449
He loved that one.

308
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,811
Then you must never sell it.

309
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:32,149
I believe that
when we lose someone we love...

310
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,984
we have the obligation
to honor their memory.

311
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,067
- You'd think eventually I'd hit something.
- Be patient. Ollie makes it look easy.

312
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,171
Is anyone going to get that?

313
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,639
I'll take that as a no. No worries.

314
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,398
No matter where I go,
I'm just answering phones.

315
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,969
Hello?

316
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,172
Oliver?

317
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:03,012
Well, I do think we've been butt dialed.

318
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,846
And here is a Joseph Kubert from 1890.

319
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,820
Hey, that's Thea.

320
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,689
That's gorgeous.

321
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,658
Wait, hold on.

322
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,858
I know that voice.

323
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,867
I actually have a painting
from his first solo exhibition in Boston.

324
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,531
Oh, God, no.

325
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,862
Who is that?

326
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,372
His name is Slade Wilson.

327
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:30,378
And unless we stop him, he's gonna
kill Oliver and his entire family.

328
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:38,047
- We have to move. Now.
- Are you sure it was Slade Wilson?

329
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,212
- I thought he was dead.
- I'm sure.

330
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,484
That's not a voice I'd ever forget.

331
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,787
What's the biggest gun
you've got down here?

332
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,562
That might work.

333
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,034
Might?

334
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,863
He has the Mirakuru in him.

335
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,533
So do I.

336
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,674
Can I trust you?

337
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,076
I'll be fine.

338
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,678
Slade was a trained killer
before he was injected.

339
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,408
You get the chance, you get a shot,
you put him down.

340
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,083
Please save Oliver.

341
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,594
Why are you doing this?

342
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,893
I'm with Oliver now.

343
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,198
- Why should I believe you?
- Because you don't want to die. Go.

344
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,345
You helped that maniac torture us.

345
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,413
Follow me.

346
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:26,388
- Where's Ivo?
- He's heading to the bridge.

347
00:26:58,684 --> 00:26:59,685
Answer the phone.

348
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,360
Please.

349
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,696
Hello?

350
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,336
Jessica, it's me.

351
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,028
Who?

352
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,368
It's Anthony.

353
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,267
Anthony.

354
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,978
I was married to a boy named Anthony.

355
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,546
- I know, sweetheart.
- But he went away.

356
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,044
I went to find a cure.

357
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,143
And I found one, sweetheart.

358
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,781
I found it. And soon...

359
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,613
He was a doctor.

360
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,055
But he went away.

361
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,236
It's harder than it looks, isn't it?

362
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,809
Ah.

363
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,843
Killing an unarmed man.

364
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,006
Seemed pretty easy
when you murdered Shado.

365
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,243
- I didn't murder her, Oliver.
- Ivo, you shot her in the head.

366
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,421
I gave you a choice.

367
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,853
You chose Sara.

368
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,919
You blame me.

369
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,024
But that's because you can't face
your own guilt.

370
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,091
I loaded the bullets, yes.
I pulled the trigger.

371
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,259
But you...

372
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,534
You aimed the gun.

373
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,271
And you hold yourself responsible.

374
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,601
Don't you?

375
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,581
Yes.

376
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,217
That doesn't mean I won't kill you.

377
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,447
The question is...

378
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,555
what will he do?

379
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,472
Is it true?

380
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,311
Tell me.

381
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,317
- Slade, I tried to tell you...
- Tell him, Oliver.

382
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:07,988
I was angry.

383
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,319
Like you are right now.

384
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,153
- I wasn't thinking clearly.
- Shut up.

385
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,825
I acted rashly. I told him to choose
between Shado and Sara.

386
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:19,761
Don't listen to him.

387
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,269
He's a monster. He will say anything.
You know that he will.

388
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,266
Tell him I'm lying, Oliver.

389
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,504
Say it.

390
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:30,840
I can explain.

391
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,847
You chose.

392
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,696
Slade.

393
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,965
Please. Ivo...

394
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,338
He's dead.

395
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,701
As dead as you are.

396
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:50,920
How many?

397
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,666
This one time, you can pray for me.

398
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,776
Behind you!

399
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,392
Ollie, are you okay? Where's Slade?

400
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,559
He knows.

401
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,933
Get down, get down!

402
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,772
- We gotta get off this ship.
- No.

403
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,274
Ollie, it's over. it's over. We gotta go.

404
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,571
We can still swim back to the island.

405
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,443
She's right, my friend.
We must hurry.

406
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,335
Unh. Slade, wait.

407
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,943
Stop. Don't move.

408
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,947
Get in the cell.

409
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,317
I do not take orders from you.

410
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,993
I am this ship's captain.

411
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,198
Not anymore.

412
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,864
This is my ship now.

413
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,873
Any objections?

414
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:04,349
Slade Wilson is dangerous.
No chances. No mistakes.

415
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,025
I'm in position.

416
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,993
When Slade comes out,
I'll have the shot.

417
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,797
Thermal imaging's coming up now.

418
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,736
They're in the northwest hall.

419
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,580
Roy, remember,
just get Thea and Moira away from Slade.

420
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,343
Don't start a fight. You'll lose. Okay?

421
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,009
Okay.

422
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,081
Let's go.

423
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,772
Ha-ha-ha. Thank you again...

424
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:01,280
- for such a wonderful and insightful tour.
- Of course.

425
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,850
You were a remarkable guide.

426
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,749
Did you have a favorite?

427
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,454
I found The Promise...

428
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,625
to be particularly compelling.

429
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,020
Thea? You home?

430
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,357
Roy? I thought I was
meeting you at Verdant.

431
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,398
Oh, yeah.

432
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,736
- Uh, this is, uh...
- I'm Roy Harper.

433
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,070
Slade Wilson.

434
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,305
That's a particularly firm handshake
you have there, son.

435
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,074
Yeah, you too.

436
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,045
Ollie.

437
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,719
There you are.

438
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:44,057
Sara, we didn't hear you come in.

439
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,752
I didn't want to interrupt the tour.

440
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,496
Mr. Wilson, this is
my son's friend, Sara Lance.

441
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,431
Of course.

442
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,838
You're the girl who came
back from the dead.

443
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,775
We're just glad to have her home.

444
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,010
Oh, I can see.

445
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:06,238
It's hard to find that special someone
who means everything to you.

446
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,178
You're very lucky.

447
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,158
So...

448
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,153
what would you like to do now...

449
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,095
Mr. Wilson?

450
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,044
Well, I hate to break up the party...

451
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,381
- but I think I should be going.
- Hmm.

452
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,418
I look forward to seeing
more of you, Moira.

453
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:49,443
Oh.

454
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,057
And your lovely family.

455
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:59,898
Dig's got a shot lined up outside.

456
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,795
Mr. Wilson.

457
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,065
May I walk you to your car?

458
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,183
Cyrus Gold...

459
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,659
the man in the skull mask.
All this was you.

460
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,193
They worked for you.

461
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,425
Well, I have my allies.

462
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,002
Just as you have yours.

463
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,106
John Diggle, for example.

464
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:43,104
I suppose you're wondering
why he hasn't taken his head shot.

465
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,076
Don't worry.

466
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,509
He's still alive.

467
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,781
For now.

468
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,456
Slade.

469
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,257
What do you want?

470
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,224
Hmm.

471
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,266
Five years ago, I made you a promise.

472
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,604
Do you remember?

473
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,083
Well, I'm here to fulfill it.

474
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,151
I'll see you around, kid.

475
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,658
We made it.

476
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,166
Where's Oliver?

477
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,852
I need you to see something.

478
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,757
Okay. Wait.

479
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,864
You need me.

480
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,834
Okay? You have the Mirakuru in you.

481
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,767
Not just in me.

482
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:28,042
You burned a box full of dirt.

483
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,283
Okay, look.
I can help you understand how it works.

484
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,079
I've spent my entire life
studying it, all right?

485
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,104
It was you.

486
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,456
You were the one who killed Shado.

487
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,017
No.

488
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:42,393
No, he chose. It was him.

489
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,305
Give him your gun.

490
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,067
Take it.

491
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,240
And show me...

492
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,539
how you killed Shado.

493
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,082
Show me!

494
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,985
Slade.

495
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,856
This isn't you.

496
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,101
It's the Mirakuru...

497
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,327
and you're sick.

498
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,530
I don't care.

499
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,934
I was trying to protect Sara.

500
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:32,006
But I didn't want Shado to die. I cared
for her too, and you know that I did.

501
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:34,580
I don't care.

502
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,851
You said we were brothers.

503
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,722
You said that.

504
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,754
Is that how you did it?

505
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:50,063
- Is that how you pointed the gun at her?
- Yes.

506
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,235
Get him out of here.

507
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,742
Why don't you just kill me?

508
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,751
If I kill you now...

509
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,921
it would be a mercy.

510
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,659
You cannot die...

511
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,487
until you have suffered...

512
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,659
the same way that I have suffered.

513
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,964
Until you have known...

514
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,303
complete despair.

515
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,273
And you will.

516
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,114
I promise.

517
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,117
Mr. Wilson leave?

518
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,851
Yeah.

519
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,978
It's getting pretty late.
I'm gonna go too.

520
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:56,703
Mm.

521
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,427
Oliver.

522
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:03,995
I know you and I have our differences, but
they hardly excuse your behavior tonight.

523
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,564
If this is the way you're
gonna act around me from

524
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:12,798
now on, then don't come
by the house any more.
