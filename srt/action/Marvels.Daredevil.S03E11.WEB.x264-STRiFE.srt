1
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,930
Help me!

2
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,560
He's back at the church!

3
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,860
All units, 10-34.
Daredevil reported at Clinton Church.

4
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,200
Mobilize level three.

5
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,620
Dispatch code 11.
Emergency services en route.

6
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,590
Dispatch 10-54 at Clinton Church.

7
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,370
This is a multiple-casualty incident.

8
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,130
What the hell did you do?

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,970
Get over there.

10
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,430
You need to assume command of the scene
from the NYPD.

11
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,300
Daredevil is a federal fugitive.

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,730
Lock down the church.
Lock down the entire area.

13
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,810
We cannot let them escape.

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,190
God damn it, I asked you a question.
What have you done?

15
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,740
It's not done.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,490
We are not done.

17
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,750
Matt?

18
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,750
Matt, come on, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Please wake up.

19
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,130
Wake up. Hey.

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,880
- Karen?
- Can you sit up?

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,380
We gotta go.

23
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,010
- Where is he?
- I don't know. I think he got away.

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
No.

25
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,730
Jesus. Father...

26
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,980
He killed him. Karen, he killed him.

27
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,940
I know. I know.
I'm sorry, but you gotta run.

28
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,360
- Cops are outside. You have to go now.
- We have to run.

29
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,320
No. No, Matt, I'm gonna stay here,
and I'll tell the police everything.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Karen, the man in my suit,
his name is Ben Poindexter.

31
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,120
He's an FBI agent. He works for Fisk.

32
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,370
So does Agent Nadeem.

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,250
They find you, they kill you.

34
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,610
Has anyone got a coat or a blanket?

35
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,780
He killed him.

36
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,530
- Who?
- Daredevil.

37
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,370
He killed Father Lantom.

38
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,790
Who's in command here?

39
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,710
I am. Captain Strieber, 15th Precinct.

40
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,840
Nadeem, FBI.

41
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,470
Daredevil is our suspect.
I'm assuming command.

42
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,850
The suspect is still at large.

43
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,520
We have civilians down on the inside,

44
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
the church and surrounding buildings
are on lockdown.

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,350
How far out is ESU?

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,650
Excuse me?

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,270
I saw Daredevil leaving the church.

48
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,690
When?

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,110
Moments before you all arrived.

50
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,780
He headed that way.

51
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,950
Well, that lines up.

52
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,660
We have two additional DOA's
in an alley a block from here.

53
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,750
I'm aware of that.
Daredevil came back to the church.

54
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,620
I saw him myself.

55
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,630
We're looking for three suspects.

56
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,880
Daredevil and his two accomplices,
and a white female. Blonde, 5'9''.

57
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,180
Her name is Karen Page.

58
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,800
Matt, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

59
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,960
Why didn't you run?

60
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,920
Run? How could I run?

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,960
God. Karen, if you get caught,
all of this was for nothing.

62
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,460
Crypt gate is locked!

63
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,510
FBI team is on the scene.
Fall back.

64
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,270
It won't hold them forever.
They'll be back.

65
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,400
Matt, you're right.

66
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,520
You're right, it's my fault.

67
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,860
I deserved the baton, not Father Lantom.

68
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,240
I should never have come here.

69
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,700
Why did you come?

70
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,030
Because Fisk knows who you are.

71
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,370
I wanted to warn you.

72
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,830
That's what this is about?

73
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah. He already knew that.

74
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,500
Oh, God. Karen, I had him.

75
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,550
I just gave up my one shot
to come here to save you.

76
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,760
What do you mean, you had him?

77
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,970
I was in his penthouse.

78
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,220
Waiting for him.

79
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,470
That was it.

80
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,810
It was...

81
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,150
...the moment.

82
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,320
What do you think you were gonna do?

83
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,360
Shh!

84
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
He's back.

85
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,660
Poindexter is upstairs,
and he's with Nadeem.

86
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,290
Clear! Clear! Clear!

87
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,370
Stay frosty.

88
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,670
They're still in here somewhere.

89
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,010
What are you gonna do when you get him?

90
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,100
I did not sign up for this shit.

91
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,980
Yes, you did.

92
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,900
All clear!
This room is secure.

93
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,650
Copy.

94
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,070
Search the living quarters.

95
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,490
Please wait here.

96
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,840
Eternal Father, I beg you...

97
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,180
welcome Paul into your holy embrace...

98
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,440
and do not punish him
for my stupid decisions,

99
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,820
for my weakness, my sin,
and for what I have brought unto us all.

100
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,200
Sister, we need access
to every area of the church grounds.

101
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Now.

102
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm sorry, Sister.

103
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,080
I know you're in mourning,
but we need your help.

104
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,640
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,390
Oh, Lord.

106
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,980
Sister, step aside.

107
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,060
Cut it.

108
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,680
- Clear!
- Clear!

109
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,120
- Shit.
- Clear!

110
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,850
What about the rectory?

111
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,440
There's also a door to the roof.
It's that way.

112
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,400
Let me show you.

113
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Okay.

114
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,530
They're gone.

115
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,450
All right. They're gone.

116
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,590
I guess we'll just wait here until...

117
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,460
until they leave.

118
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,890
Why is Fisk hunting you?

119
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,970
Had a plan.

120
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,310
Went to go see him.

121
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,690
You went to see Fisk?

122
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,900
Yeah, I thought maybe I could provoke him,

123
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,110
turn his emotions against him.

124
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,650
To what end?

125
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,660
Make him attack me in front of the FBI.

126
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,620
Jesus, Karen.

127
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Yeah.

128
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,960
Don't worry, it didn't work. He...

129
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,550
caught me off guard, asked me
how long I'd known your secret.

130
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,970
I swear I tried, but he just...

131
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,930
He read it in my face.

132
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,310
You tried to outsmart Fisk?
Provoke him into making a mistake?

133
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,810
Fine, okay, right. You're right.
I was an idiot. Sorry.

134
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,690
No, you were brave.

135
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,360
Anyway, he didn't take the bait.

136
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
What was the bait?

137
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,710
I told him a secret of my own.

138
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,010
You remember that friend he had
that got shot?

139
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,970
Uh...

140
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,980
Wesley?

141
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,020
I killed him.

142
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,030
That's why he sent Poindexter after me.

143
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,030
- I was stupid and...
- and reckless,

144
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,740
and now Father Lantom
is dead because of it.

145
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,290
Because of... because of me.

146
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,620
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,080
I don't know. You...

148
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,420
You always, uh, treated me like I was...

149
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,390
innocent.

150
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,560
That was nice... It was nice
that you thought of me like that.

151
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,230
What were you gonna do to Fisk?

152
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,690
Kill him.

153
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,280
- Your turn to judge me.
- No.

154
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,450
No, I'm not. I get it.

155
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,120
Trust me.

156
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,080
Just makes me, uh...

157
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,340
It makes me sad for you.

158
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,920
It has to be done, Karen.

159
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,800
Okay, you're gonna
have to listen to me here.

160
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,350
Okay, listen to me.

161
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Okay, I never told you
why I left Vermont, right?

162
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,850
Why I left home.

163
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,440
Okay, see, there was a car crash.

164
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,860
And...

165
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,990
Um, I killed my brother, uh,
because I was... I was high

166
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,030
- and I was drunk and I was angry...
- Jesus, Karen.

167
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,620
...and I shouldn't have been driving,
and it changed everything.

168
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,330
No matter what I do...

169
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,920
there is no atoning for that.

170
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,170
Okay? There is no way
to come back from it.

171
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,260
What if... it is the way back?

172
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,140
For me?

173
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,980
I can't let Fisk go.

174
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,320
Killing anyone...

175
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,990
even Fisk...

176
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,950
it will change everything that you...

177
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,290
that you feel about yourself.

178
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,450
For the past two years,

179
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,870
ever since his unjust conviction
on racketeering charges,

180
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,710
our client has maintained his innocence
and fought to clear his good name.

181
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,090
One hour ago,
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals

182
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,840
overturned the conviction of Wilson Fisk.

183
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,550
Having seen the proof
that they were wrong,

184
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,520
the Department of Justice will not be
going forward with charges.

185
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,400
As of tonight, we are proud to announce
that justice has prevailed

186
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,740
and Wilson Fisk is once again a free man.

187
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,830
I know that most of you
find this difficult to accept.

188
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,880
That's only because
you've been manipulated...

189
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,550
poisoned into believing
the news media's fake story...

190
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,340
that I am evil,

191
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,810
that I am a criminal.

192
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,730
Quite the opposite is true.

193
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,230
Because I challenge the system...

194
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,280
because I've told the truth and tried
to make this city a better place,

195
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,700
the people in power
decided to tear me down...

196
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,410
to tear me down with false allegations.

197
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,460
They sent someone to frame me.

198
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Daredevil.

199
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,460
The killer who's now showing
his true colors,

200
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,090
who has tried to murder people
in newspaper offices and churches...

201
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,890
attacking our sacred institutions.

202
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,890
Believe me.

203
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,730
Daredevil is our true public enemy.

204
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,910
Agent Nadeem?

205
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,790
Detective Mahoney.

206
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,960
I'm taking over the murder investigation
on our side.

207
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,000
Great. We'll share what we've got ASAP.
I promise.

208
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,840
Thanks. But between you and me,
there's something off about all of this.

209
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
What's that?

210
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,220
Well, a number of witnesses claim
Daredevil was trying to kill Karen Page.

211
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,730
And your people are making her out
to be his accomplice.

212
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,770
There's more to this story
than you're aware of, Detective.

213
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,030
Thanks for bringing it to my attention,
but this is our crime scene.

214
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,360
We'll let you know if we need anything.

215
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,340
Dex, this is getting
out of control.

216
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,000
Someone needs to call Kingpin.

217
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,670
Dex?

218
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,470
Hello?

219
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,890
Yeah?

220
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,470
What?

221
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,810
I'm saying we should get in front of this.

222
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,270
Someone needs to call Kingpin.

223
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,150
And say what?

224
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,730
That we failed?

225
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
"We"?

226
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,980
There something that you want
to say to me, Arinori?

227
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,780
Hey, this isn't helping.

228
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,700
Dex, they're in the wind.

229
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,620
And we're not gonna find 'em tonight.

230
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,420
I'm gonna release the ESU
and open the scene to forensics.

231
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,250
No. No way.

232
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,500
You get the NYPD to go
to every house in the neighborhood.

233
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,170
Door to door.

234
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,880
We do not stop until we find them.

235
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,140
Dex, they're gone.

236
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,470
Fine, call it off.

237
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,560
And you call Kingpin

238
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,640
and tell him you're the reason
that Karen Page is still breathing,

239
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,940
that you gave up.

240
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,860
Okay. A few more hours.

241
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,960
Sister, do you mind
if I ask you a couple of questions?

242
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,500
Do you know the suspects?

243
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,680
As far as I'm aware, the only one
you've identified by name is Karen Page.

244
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,300
And, yes, she and I are acquainted.

245
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,720
Do you know where she might have gone?

246
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,310
I thought you believed the suspects
were still hiding in the church.

247
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,940
We do. I do.
I meant where on the church grounds.

248
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,820
May I ask you a personal question,
Agent Nadeem?

249
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,070
Okay.

250
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,330
Do you consider yourself a moral person?

251
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,460
I like to think so.

252
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,330
I try to be.

253
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,050
My good friend died here tonight,

254
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,220
protecting Karen Page from evil.

255
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,520
If you're the kind of man you claim to be,
do you really want to help it find her?

256
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,490
Thank you.

257
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,130
What? What is it?

258
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,010
Thank God.

259
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,430
It's not safe for you to come out yet.

260
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,940
Yeah, we know. I can hear 'em.

261
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,440
I can come back with food,

262
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,280
but in the meantime,
you should get cleaned up.

263
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,860
We have fresh clothes.

264
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,370
Donations for the poor.

265
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,120
Uh, thank you.

266
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,590
Uh, Sister...

267
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,970
for what it's worth, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

268
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,180
This is not your fault.

269
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,800
Father Lantom didn't deserve this.

270
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,890
Few of us get what we deserve.

271
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,940
These should fit you.

272
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,240
I'll come back as soon as I can.
You'll be safe here.

273
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,120
No, we won't.

274
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,370
They brought in search dogs.

275
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,250
Search over here.

276
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,550
Track. Track.

277
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,640
Not me, fellas. The bad guys.

278
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
All right.

279
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,180
Wait.

280
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,850
Tell them what you saw.

281
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,190
- The man in black is next door.
- What?

282
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,940
I saw him go in, slam the door.
It was him...

283
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,940
- Where?
- The orphanage.

284
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,280
Please tell me
we got all the kids out of there.

285
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,280
I don't know.

286
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,950
Come on, let's move.

287
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,750
Yeah.

288
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,830
They're taking the dogs next door.

289
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Buys us some time.

290
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,060
Jesus, Matt.

291
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,900
Couldn't put it on in front of her?

292
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,780
You know, something just kinda hit me.

293
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,570
Watching you...
wall yourself off from her.

294
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,200
You know?

295
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,750
Uh, yeah. She told me.

296
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,880
Said she felt ashamed about what she did.

297
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,720
And that... everyone
you ever cared about left you.

298
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,300
- Can we not do this now?
- Is that why you

299
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,430
- insist on doing everything alone?
- I don't insist...

300
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,100
- Pushing Foggy and me away.
- I'm not.

301
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,740
I told you, I'm tryin' to protect you...

302
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,640
I think you're trying to protect yourself.

303
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,440
You wanna talk about this right now?

304
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,560
There are people tryin' to kill us,
and you wanna...

305
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,520
Just shut up for a second, Matt, okay?

306
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,160
Look, I was never gonna leave you
up there, and I'm not leaving you now.

307
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,900
Neither will Foggy.

308
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,200
Despite the fact that you've been
a complete asshole to him,

309
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,240
he'd still follow you over a cliff.

310
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
Yeah.

311
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,670
Okay. So, what, you agree?

312
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,460
That could actually work.

313
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,670
I don't get it. What could work?

314
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,350
Foggy.

315
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,980
Mr. Fisk's people said you had to call
a press conference and read it.

316
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Jesus.

317
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,060
You're calling him "Mr. Fisk" now?

318
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,110
"I was acting under duress

319
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,240
when I falsely and publicly accused
Wilson Fisk of criminal activities.

320
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,740
Daredevil threatened
the lives of my family,

321
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,000
but in light of recent events,
I now see that I did the wrong thing,

322
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,250
that I must stand up for what's right."

323
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,290
- I can't say this.
- You have to.

324
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,710
It's complete bullshit.

325
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,880
You know what's bullshit, Foggy?

326
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,260
The fact that me and Mom and Dad
are caught up in this in the first place.

327
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,780
The only reason these people tricked us
into that bank loan...

328
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,970
You knew it was fraud
when you signed it.

329
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,940
Okay, yeah. But it only happened
because Fisk wanted to get to you.

330
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,730
Everything that's happened,
the suppliers cuttin' us off, the loan,

331
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,230
all that shit happened because you wanted
to be the big-time lawyer

332
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,280
instead of hangin' around here
with us losers.

333
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,780
Come on. That's not fair.

334
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,030
No, it's not. None of it is.

335
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,000
We didn't have any say in this, Foggy.

336
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,710
You went and pissed off
the biggest mob boss in the city,

337
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,110
but we're the ones paying for it.

338
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,290
Or we will if you don't do what he says.

339
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,510
If I read that statement to the press,
Fisk wins, Theo.

340
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,680
He's already won, Fogg.

341
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,550
Now, do the right thing.

342
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,430
The right thing for your family.

343
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Hello?

344
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,570
Matt?

345
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:41,120
The deputy AG has ruled that you
continue to be a valuable DOJ asset

346
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
who deserves ongoing protection.

347
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,830
Because they're terrified
of the PR hit if you get killed.

348
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,460
Thank you, Agent Hattley.

349
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,750
That will be all.

350
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,050
Well, where is Vanessa?

351
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,390
In the air.
Her plane took off an hour ago.

352
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,360
Then there's only one thing
left for me to do,

353
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,270
which, apparently, I have to do myself.

354
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,770
We doubled the offer, threw in incentives,
but the owner wouldn't sell.

355
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,480
Not at any price.

356
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,440
Then I'll visit her in person.

357
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,400
I'll make a more compelling offer.

358
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,330
All the way up
to the rectory, right?

359
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,790
That's what they said.

360
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Sorry, sir, this is an active...

361
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,560
Hey, are you Foggy Nelson?

362
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,850
Guilty as charged, Officer...

363
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,270
- "Minelli."
- It's an honor to meet you.

364
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,520
I signed our union's endorsement letter.
I hope you kick Blake Tower's ass.

365
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,230
With people like you backing me up,
how could I not?

366
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,570
Hey, listen, I'm here to talk to
Detective Mahoney. You think you could...

367
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,920
Move!

368
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Nelson?

369
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,720
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,890
Agent Nadeem, pleasure to see you again.

371
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,970
I asked you a question.
What are you doing here?

372
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,770
You know, just observing the hard work
of our men and women in blue.

373
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,070
That's some weak bullshitting.
You wanna try that again?

374
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,940
Okay. You caught me.

375
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,900
Truth is, I'm killing time.

376
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,620
Killing time for what?

377
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,700
Why do you keep looking at her?

378
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,870
Because I need to kill a few more seconds.

379
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,250
Okay, I'm good.

380
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,250
Agent Nadeem, I'm here for my client.

381
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,010
- Your...
- Client.

382
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,390
Don't shoot! She's unarmed.

383
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,970
This is why I'm here.
To surrender my client.

384
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
Good.

385
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,520
To the NYPD.

386
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,310
Karen Page, you are under arrest.

387
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
Cuff her.

388
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,780
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,950
She's ours, Detective.

390
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,200
Like hell.

391
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,660
She's a federal suspect.

392
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,530
She's a suspected accomplice to murder.

393
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,660
That's state law.

394
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,750
And she's here to surrender to the NYPD.

395
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,660
Shut up.

396
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,230
I'm saying,
as the only attorney here,

397
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,170
- I could help clear...
- Put a sock in it, Nelson.

398
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,920
These feds know the law.
She's our suspect.

399
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,050
They can file a writ
and maybe talk to her later.

400
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,380
I will not let you take her.

401
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,840
You and what army?

402
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,260
Hey, we're on the same team here.

403
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,810
Detective, a word?

404
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,150
What part of "our crime scene"
do you not understand?

405
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,570
Ben, we're all cut up
about what happened here.

406
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,650
A word. Please.

407
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,330
You need to stand your people down.

408
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,880
Listen to me very carefully.

409
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,050
If we take Karen Page into custody,
she'll be dead before she reaches HQ.

410
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,300
No, don't react.

411
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,880
Just get her the hell away from us.
We clear?

412
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,930
Crystal.

413
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,770
Detective Mahoney
will take custody of the suspect.

414
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,890
Bullshit!

415
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,190
We'll have her back in an hour.
Hattley will pull strings.

416
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,150
No.

417
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,270
You can't kill her here anyway.

418
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,030
You messed up, Ray.

419
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,160
You really... really messed up.

420
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,310
Mrs. Falb. My name is...

421
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,730
I know who you are.

422
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,190
Take off your shoes.

423
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,870
It's beautiful.

424
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,040
It certainly is.

425
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,870
It's peaceful and so...

426
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,380
It's been through quite a bit
over the years.

427
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,920
But it's home now.

428
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:56,680
I hope you're not here
to offer me more money for it.

429
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,270
- Would it change your mind?
- It would not.

430
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,060
I understand
you became aware of the painting

431
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,280
when it was taken away from me
by the government.

432
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,440
Yes.

433
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,280
Ironic, I suppose.

434
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,700
It was a government
that took it from my family in 1943.

435
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,830
So, then, you are particularly suited
to understanding my situation.

436
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,670
The painting was given to me
by the woman that I love.

437
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,050
When I'm with it, I am with her.

438
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,050
She must be an amazing woman.

439
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,630
Yes.

440
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,140
Yeah, she's given me much
in the short time I've had with her.

441
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,690
She brought focus to my life.
Love, if you will.

442
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,730
This painting is bound up in that love.

443
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,690
It's part of me. It's part of us.

444
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,280
My years on this earth...
have taught me...

445
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,950
there is nothing more important than love.

446
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,080
I didn't have much of it.

447
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,250
And when it was offered to me,
I was too afraid to accept it.

448
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,550
I understand.

449
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,220
Well, then, you will understand me
when I say this:

450
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,930
that painting was not hers to give.

451
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,680
She was unaware of the provenance.

452
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,730
She gave it with love.

453
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,020
It was not taken with love.

454
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,280
I was a toddler
when the wolves came to our door.

455
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,120
The gestapo demanded everything we had.

456
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,950
Including that painting.

457
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,450
My father fought them...

458
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,830
...and they shot him in front of us.

459
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:55,220
Do you know what it's like
to see your father take his last breath

460
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,590
on the floor in front of you?

461
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,140
As they marched my family
across Poland to the ghetto...

462
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,110
my mother went hungry to feed us.

463
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,700
But of the seven members of my family,
we were the only ones who survived.

464
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,870
I am deeply sorry
for everything you've suffered.

465
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:31,590
This painting is my connection
to the people I love.

466
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,220
I know who you are, Mr. Fisk.

467
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,720
You are a wolf, too.

468
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:47,060
Men like you took away my family,
took my ability to love...

469
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,650
and almost took my life.

470
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,860
You will take nothing more.

471
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,660
You have been through so very much.

472
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,290
Vanessa would want you
to keep the painting.

473
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,720
Is that supposed to matter to me?

474
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,930
No.

475
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,850
But it matters to me.

476
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,370
What kind of psycho
kills a priest?

477
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,160
This makes me sick.

478
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,840
Come on out of there.

479
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,220
The FBI is going to freak
when they find out you let us go.

480
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,510
Yeah, well,
they can kiss my police-blue ass.

481
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,390
Seriously, are you gonna be okay?

482
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,860
I had to see it with my own eyes.
Fisk really has turned the goddamn feds.

483
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,150
- Some of them.
- Can't believe no one saw it coming.

484
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,030
Well, actually, some of us did.

485
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,570
Yeah, that's true.

486
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,030
Nice takedown on Blake Tower, by the way.

487
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,370
I posted the video on my profile page.

488
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,450
Brett, I'm flattered.

489
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,750
Even if he did crush your ass at the end.

490
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,370
He didn't crush my ass.

491
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,140
You ran out of there
like a scared little...

492
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,090
- Nah, uh... it's my fault.
- Yeah, whatever.

493
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,670
You guys aren't alone in this,
you understand?

494
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,220
Fisk put a lot of my brothers and sisters
in the ground,

495
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,890
and none of us have forgotten that.

496
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,180
If you can find a way
to bring down that son of a bitch,

497
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,560
every cop in the city
is gonna have your back.

498
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,850
Thanks, Brett.

499
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,520
Take care of yourself.

500
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,980
Okay, so how do we play this?

501
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,900
Simple. We convince Matt
to take his head out of his ass.

502
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,580
So it looks like you needed
my help after all.

503
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,830
Yeah.

504
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,840
Yeah, I did, Foggy. You're right.

505
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,050
Do you have any idea how much
life has sucked for Karen and me

506
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,010
while you were off doin' your own thing?

507
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,840
No, but I'm sorry, Foggy.

508
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,850
Maybe I was wrong to... to push you away.

509
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,100
Okay, it's insanely hard to fight with you
if you keep agreeing with me.

510
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,980
Good, 'cause I don't wanna fight with you.

511
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,650
Look, the way I've treated you,
the way I've treated you both...

512
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,400
You've deserved better.

513
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,490
Yes, we did.

514
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,910
Yes, you did.

515
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay, so where do we go from here?

516
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,370
I don't want to leave you,

517
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,250
but I can't ask you to be accomplices
to what I have to do now.

518
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,840
What does that mean?

519
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,050
Um...

520
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,090
It means that, uh, Matt's gonna kill Fisk.

521
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,100
That building falling on you
really did mess up your head.

522
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,140
We put him in prison, Foggy.
Look what happened.

523
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,230
It's not gonna be the same this time.

524
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,190
They're gonna throw him
in some supermax hole...

525
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,110
- Come on.
- ...where he can't compromise anybody.

526
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,860
- I know you're not that naive.
- It's called having faith in the system.

527
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,190
Something you used to have.

528
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,410
It's called facing the reality
that some people are so rich and powerful,

529
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,660
the system simply can't handle them,

530
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,790
that they actually are above the law.

531
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,790
That's the bullshit that people like Fisk
want you to believe.

532
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,040
Nobody's above the law.

533
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,880
The only thing powerful enough
to take down scumbags like him is the law.

534
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,260
He's twisted it into something
that actually protects him.

535
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,630
Federal law, maybe,

536
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,550
but we can build a state case
that even Blake Tower can't deny,

537
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,720
force him to take it to the grand jury.

538
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,810
Fisk has been five steps ahead of us
at every turn.

539
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,850
You really think
he's gonna allow that to happen?

540
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,190
Hey, you're right. You're right.
Maybe just hear him out.

541
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,770
Fine. I'm telling you,
it's not gonna work.

542
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,200
You want to give the law another try,
sure, I'm all ears.

543
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,530
Simple.

544
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,450
Step one, we work together.

545
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,620
Step two, we come up with a plan.
And step three, we execute that plan.

546
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,580
That's genius.
Come up with that by yourself?

547
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,840
So I'm still working out the details.

548
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,550
What about this?

549
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,670
What about we find ourselves
another witness?

550
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,260
Someone who will flip on Fisk.

551
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,100
But unlike Jasper Evans,
we keep 'em alive this time.

552
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,680
Someone who knows the details
of Fisk's criminal operation...

553
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,940
who has nothing to lose.

554
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,020
Okay?

555
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,980
No.

556
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,610
No, we find someone
who has everything to lose.

557
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Copy that.

558
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,540
Karen Page has been found.

559
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,750
NYPD took her into custody.

560
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,050
The police? How?

561
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,510
It was Agent Nadeem's call.

562
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,050
Your jacket.

563
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,180
- Sir?
- Give me your jacket.

564
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,390
Pull over.

565
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,760
Get rid of the body.

566
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,770
Yes, sir.

567
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,000
Seema! Are you here?

568
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,800
What's the matter?

569
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Dad?

570
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
It's okay. It's okay, Sami.

571
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,890
I saw the broken vase, and I got worried.

572
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,560
Dad, sorry. I knocked it over.

573
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,690
Mom said she was gonna clean it up later.

574
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,810
Are you mad?

575
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,770
No. No, of course not.

576
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,690
- We have to pack. Now.
- What's the...

577
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,650
Just for a few days, okay?

578
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,780
I have to work.
I want you to go away, okay?

579
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,910
Someplace fun. Like Disney World. Yeah?

580
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,580
But it has to be right this minute.

581
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,710
It's okay, Sami. It'll... It'll be fine.

582
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,960
- We can pack together. Come on.
- Go. Go, go, go, go.

583
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,800
- What's going on?
- I'll explain everything when you're safe.

584
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,890
- You're scaring me.
- Be scared later. Now, just hurry.

585
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,050
Stop.

586
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,630
This way.

587
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
Get back.

588
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,190
The sliders.

589
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,730
Take Sami into the bathroom
and lie down in the tub.

590
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
Now!

591
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,580
Obviously, I'm here to help you.

592
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,800
I sold you out to Fisk.

593
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,210
I know you didn't want to.

594
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,470
But I did.

595
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:11,260
So maybe you're here
because you wanna be the one that kills me

596
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,890
before Fisk gets around to it.

597
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,270
If we're gonna get your family
someplace safe,

598
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,680
you're gonna have to trust me.

599
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,600
I can't trust anybody.

600
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,730
Well, I trust you.

601
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,070
You saved Karen Page's life tonight.

602
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,120
So I owe you one.
