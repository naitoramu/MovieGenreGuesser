00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:09,041
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,250
God!

3
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,916
No, it isn't going down. Give me another.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,833
- Please, please!
- Another one!

5
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,000
Another shot!

6
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,458
Come on, come on, come on.

7
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,541
What's going on?

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,125
Okay, he's better, he's better.

9
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,458
He's fine.

10
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,541
- 00:26
- 00:25

11
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,833
- 00:24
- 00:23

12
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,416
How much time is left?

13
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,583
Five seconds.

14
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,791
- 00:03
- 00:02

15
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,208
- 00:01
- 00:00

16
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,041
Doors are unlocked.
Everyone, get ready. Come on!

17
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:24,125
Get ready! Masks on, now!

18
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,875
Smoke! Now!

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,250
Silence!

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,500
Fuck, be quiet!

21
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,083
It's only smoke.

22
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,041
Not yet. Hold on.

23
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,083
Helicopters, descending in 30 seconds.

24
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,375
Now! We're going out. Come on!

25
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,375
Now. Fast. Everyone out.

26
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,708
Come on. We're going out.

27
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,333
Everyone out. Fast, fast, fast.

28
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,000
Come on! Out!

29
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,333
Come on, come on! Out!

30
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,666
Fast!

31
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,541
What the fuck?

32
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,958
We can't enter through there.

33
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,166
We have to abort.

34
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,666
I don't care about the balconies.
If they have the hostages there,

35
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,125
we'll knock down the main door.

36
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,041
Armored units, move forward!

37
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,375
Come on, come on!
The bad guys are at the door.

38
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,500
I'll open the door and you'll get out,
arms raised high with these boxes.

39
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,125
Is that what you think, orphan?

40
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,333
Fuck.

41
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,875
They're opening the doors.

42
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,083
All the better.
Let's enter with all we have. Now!

43
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,416
I'm telling you to get out there.

44
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,958
Nobody moves.

45
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,625
Get out there, now!

46
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,208
The special forces are arriving.
Nobody move.

47
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,500
What are you going to do?

48
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,541
Are you going to shoot us,
like your daddy was shot?

49
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,708
Nobody move!

50
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,250
Denver! What are you doing?

51
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,208
Denver!

52
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,708
What are you doing, Denver?

53
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,666
And brother, here's the big surprise.
The one you're already thinking about.

54
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,666
White flag!

55
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,125
White flag!

56
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,333
White flag!

57
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,583
What is he doing?

58
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,833
What is he doing?

59
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,500
White flag!

60
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,375
White flag!

61
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,875
<i>Target confirmed.</i>

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,875
Denver!

63
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,333
<i>I have the target in sight.
He's in my line of fire.</i>

64
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,125
<i>Requesting permission to shoot.</i>

65
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,380
<i>Requesting permission to shoot.
I repeat, requesting permission to shoot.</i>

66
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,666
<i>A state can accept that they had
to deploy the army on the streets.</i>

67
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,333
A state can allow you to go into
the national reserve and steal the gold,

68
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,916
but there's something
they can't allow happen.

69
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,666
A state can't tolerate
you getting to their secrets.

70
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,166
<i>If we get those red boxes out,
and they see them,</i>

71
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,625
<i>it will only take them a second to realize
what we have in our hands,</i>

72
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,791
<i>and they'll be ours.</i>

73
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,291
Those sons of bitches.

74
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,333
Because in those 24 boxes,

75
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,708
<i>there are the secrets
from the Ministry of the Interior,</i>

76
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:25,833
<i>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Intelligence,
and how they spend the reserve fund.</i>

77
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,333
<i>The sewers of the state!</i>

78
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,166
<i>All those things
the system can't allow to go public,</i>

79
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,958
or they'd go down the drain
where their own shit is hidden.

80
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,666
<i>Sons of bitches!</i>

81
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,041
Stop the assault!

82
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,791
<i>I repeat. Abort.
Respect the white flag and withdraw.</i>

83
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,541
Is it possible for those cocksuckers
to dive inside the chamber?

84
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,791
I don't know, Colonel.

85
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,791
<i>- I don't know.
- For God's sake!</i>

86
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,958
Yes!

87
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,375
Yes!

88
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,500
Gay sex is the best in the world,
and do you know why?

89
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,500
It's obvious.

90
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,291
Because there are no women.

91
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,083
You aren't homosexual,
you're misogynistic.

92
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,416
- How were you not born in a cauldron?
- No, ma'am.

93
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,333
Don't mistake misogyny with biology.
They're facts. It's very simple.

94
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,250
We, men, need to get rid of our poison.

95
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,125
Every few hours, we need to boom boom.

96
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,416
Later, we reject the body
that we spilled it onto.

97
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,892
It doesn't matter which body,
we can't help but to reject it.

98
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,166
Then, we say, <i>"Ciao."</i>

99
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,958
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

100
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,666
- Beautiful.
- Homosexual sex.

101
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,666
Sex between women is also homosexual.

102
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,666
Boom, boom, <i>ciao. </i>Two men meet
and they relieve each other.

103
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,541
Boom, boom, <i>ciao. </i>They don't even know
each other's names. Wonderful.

104
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,208
Do you know what's wonderful?

105
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,000
The fantastic fucks women can enjoy.

106
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,125
And we can do it ten times
in succession...

107
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,375
- Or more.
- And multiple orgasms.

108
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,250
We can cum for hours, not in five seconds.

109
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,476
I'm not saying that God didn't give you
the possibility of feeling pleasure,

110
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,916
saying that would be misogynistic.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,625
I am simply saying you don't need it.

112
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,833
- In that case...
- It's not as organic a need

113
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,958
as it is for men. Let me explain myself.

114
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,583
The world is full of saunas
where men meet and relieve each other.

115
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,375
Public parks, public toilets,
where we find each other and do the deed.

116
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,875
It's seminal altruism.

117
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,416
Where are those saunas for women?

118
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,416
- We don't need them.
- You don't?

119
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,000
- Of course not.
- They don't exist.

120
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:19,291
Where are the public toilets
where you rub your tits? They don't exist.

121
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,918
I'm going to tell you why,
and it's controversial.

122
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:27,125
That's because female sex
is conditioned by procreation.

123
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:34,291
In some way or another, you're looking
for a man to exchange genes.

124
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,916
To form a family, which is revolting.

125
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,541
You have too many things in your head.

126
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,958
We have only one. Ejaculate.

127
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,041
That's why we do: boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

128
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,458
Boom, boom, <i>ciao. </i>Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

129
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,958
Gay sex!

130
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,458
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

131
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,666
Look, your theory is fucking shit,
but the rhythm is catchy.

132
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,583
No.

133
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,625
- Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>
- I'm out of here.

134
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,500
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

135
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,125
- Professor!
- Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

136
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,767
- Come on, Professor.
- Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

137
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,958
Professor!

138
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,375
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

139
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,458
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

140
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,125
- Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>
- Let your hair down, Professor!

141
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,208
- Let your hair down, Professor!
- Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

142
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,500
Boom, boom, <i>ciao.</i>

143
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,958
<i>Boom, boom, </i>ciao.

144
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,500
Good night.

145
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,416
I can leave, if you want. No problem.

146
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,666
Okay.

147
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,666
We have to be practical, Helsinki.

148
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,750
You were good. You're a titan.
That's true, I can say that.

149
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,875
But we're professionals.

150
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,625
Not like the rest of the idiots
in this gang, right?

151
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,708
Right.

152
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,583
Can you imagine going in there
carrying an emotional backpack?

153
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,125
It's absurd, don't you think?
We pumped out our poison.

154
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,875
We did the boom, boom. And now...

155
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:06,958
Now, <i>ciao.</i>

156
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,375
No backpack.

157
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,625
Well, now we're blood brothers.

158
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,250
Brothers, pals, something like that.
Aren't we?

159
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,916
Yes, brothers.

160
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,625
What's wrong?

161
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,416
It's better I sleep here.

162
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,666
Tomorrow is a big day.

163
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,070
He fucked you and kicked you out.

164
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,708
What a disgusting asshole!

165
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,708
- Between men, that's the way.
- You're not like that.

166
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,166
I've traveled the world with you,
and you're a teddy bear, darling.

167
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,750
And if you could spend the next 12 hours
cuddling him, you'd prefer that.

168
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,333
We're colleagues. Brothers.

169
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,541
You're not his brother!

170
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,541
Helsinki!

171
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,416
You have to love yourself more.

172
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,583
And get over that disrespectful asshole.

173
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:35,166
The next time he tells you, "Boom, boom,"
you tell him, <i>"Ciao."</i>

174
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,541
And that he can stick his boom-boom
up his ass.

175
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,875
Okay.

176
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,375
Helsi.

177
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,208
Are you in love?

178
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,416
Brothers.

179
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,583
Damn.

180
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,541
<i>There are weird days.</i>

181
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,750
<i>You should be in an important meeting,</i>

182
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,500
<i>but a while ago, you were clinically dead
and dressed as a diver.</i>

183
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,693
<i>You're still wearing the neoprene,</i>

184
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,291
<i>and you really don't know
if you're dead or alive.</i>

185
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,541
<i>You feel as if you had the biggest
hangover in the world, and you wonder...</i>

186
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>"Is this hell?</i>

187
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,833
<i>What did I do wrong?"
You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

188
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,625
<i>Well, the same as everyone else.</i>

189
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,208
<i>Being in the wrong place...</i>

190
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,416
<i>at the worst time of all.</i>

191
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,875
Governor?

192
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,416
Governor?

193
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,791
Governor?

194
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,041
Governor!

195
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,750
Your heart almost exploded.

196
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,750
We injected enough Diazepam in you
for a whole family. Please lie down.

197
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,708
I'm perfectly fine.

198
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,041
Easy, easy.

199
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,666
Be careful.

200
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,208
Be careful.

201
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,916
If you're feeling fine,

202
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,333
come with me. I'm going to show you
what a beauty we've built.

203
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,125
Come, Governor. Look.

204
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,583
Look. What do you smell? Smell!

205
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,583
What's the smell?

206
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:32,291
That's it! There's no smell.
Industrial extractors.

207
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,458
The gases go through the machine
and they get liquefied.

208
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,625
Then, it goes to the vault.

209
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,125
Atmospheric contamination, zero.

210
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,666
But be careful tomorrow,
because there will be way too much CO2.

211
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,083
Here...

212
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,625
We're melting 52 ingots per hour.

213
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,500
We've already reached cruising speed.

214
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Those are state assets.

215
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,708
And every single drop is there.

216
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,500
We already melted 1600 kilos.
Isn't that right?

217
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,458
How many days have I been unconscious?

218
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,166
Four hours.

219
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,750
Come here, Mr. Mario.
This is the best part.

220
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,208
Look at that.

221
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,583
Look, Mr. Mario. This is the best part.

222
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,666
Come, come.

223
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,916
Look how it spills out.

224
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,333
Look how it spills out. There!
So beautiful!

225
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,750
So beautiful!

226
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,291
Good evening, Governor. Chorizo?

227
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,791
Here, we turn the melted gold into grains.

228
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,458
Pips of gold, like rice grains.

229
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,750
We do everything with bubbles.

230
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,291
It's addictive.

231
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,416
Look at these!

232
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,333
Golden seeds, Governor.

233
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,833
Miss, what you're doing here
will bring countless consequences.

234
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,166
<i>That's the lesson: Nothing is free.</i>

235
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,333
<i>Everything we do has consequences.</i>

236
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,291
<i>Almost a million people surround
the Bank of Spain.</i>

237
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,833
<i>The government is under a lot of pressure.</i>

238
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,500
<i>And the big question, Sara Solomando,</i>

239
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,541
<i>what was in those boxes to make
the police and the army stop the assault?</i>

240
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,875
<i>For now, Cristina, all our questions
have been answered with silence.</i>

241
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,916
<i>Since the assault was aborted,
many official cars have arrived,</i>

242
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,083
from the highest ranks.

243
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,625
Among them, the Minister of the Interior,
the State Secretary of Foreign Affairs

244
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,708
<i>and the Chief of the Defense Staff.</i>

245
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,250
<i>and the crowd was not happy
to see any of them.</i>

246
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,625
<i>The consequences have begun to arrive.</i>

247
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,208
<i>The Minister of the Interior,
the Chief of the Defense Staff,</i>

248
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,791
<i>all of them came to the command center</i>

249
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,625
<i>during the four hours
the governor had been unconscious.</i>

250
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,916
The Prime Minister wants the crowd
to be dispersed immediately.

251
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,208
Tell him that if we disperse
the crowd with water cannons,

252
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,691
tomorrow we won't have
one million people out there, but two.

253
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,125
The European Union
is demanding information.

254
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,148
They want to know if the contents
in the boxes implicate them.

255
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,166
Of course it implicates them,
but they can't know that.

256
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,125
Understood?

257
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,708
Your job is to reduce the diplomatic
pressure so I can do my job.

258
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,166
They already think there must be
something quite big.

259
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,916
They saw how the Spanish forces stopped
an assault against seven delinquents.

260
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,208
<i>Colonel Tamayo had tried it,</i>

261
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,958
<i>but as in a game of chess,</i>

262
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,166
<i>the Professor and Berlin's plan
had changed everything.</i>

263
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,541
<i>One move</i>

264
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,791
<i>and now it was them
who were under the threat of a checkmate</i>

265
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,541
<i>against the king and the rest
of the government's institutions.</i>

266
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,541
<i>The contents of those 24 boxes
took less than an hour to get to Pakistan.</i>

267
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,250
<i>Our legion of hackers opened
a secure and undetectable email account</i>

268
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,208
<i>through an opaque satellite.</i>

269
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,916
<i>If we published that information,
they would be dead.</i>

270
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,375
<i>And they knew it.</i>

271
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,666
What's the real size of the leak?

272
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Colonel?

273
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,666
Minister.

274
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,875
The size of the leak...

275
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,083
Europe causing a war in Libya
because of personal interests.

276
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,708
Payments to Morocco in exchange
for leaving immigrants in the desert.

277
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,583
The confidential agreement to look away
from the Mediterranean.

278
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,208
Seventy-four shipwrecks that could've
been avoided, hundreds drowned.

279
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,041
Even if it sounds old, all the details

280
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,333
about the creation of a terrorist group
in the south of France. Do you want more?

281
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,833
The contents of those boxes condemn
this government and the previous ones.

282
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,125
The shit is going to land on Spain,
the European Union, and NATO.

283
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,333
And what's worse...

284
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,750
we'd be bringing ourselves down.
You, you, you and me.

285
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:21,458
Are we willing to end up in the court?
Is that what the prime minister wants?

286
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,291
Is there any prime minister in Europe
who wants to go to jail?

287
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,166
That's the size of the fucking leak.

288
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,291
We can't negotiate with that man.

289
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,291
If he has the secrets,
he will always be a threat.

290
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,125
So?

291
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,000
What do you propose?

292
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,291
We can only do one thing.

293
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,791
You know it well.

294
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:15,583
Good evening, I'm Alicia Sierra,
for those who don't know me.

295
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,583
And I'm going to be in charge
of the robbery's negotiations.

296
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,166
Let the party begins.

297
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,958
I want three little things.
I know you can do it.

298
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:31,500
I want to know how much gasoline they have
to feed the emergency generators.

299
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,083
Second,

300
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,416
bring in the underground teams

301
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,340
so they can tell me exactly
what's under there.

302
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,208
Tunnels, galleries, sewers.

303
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,125
Okay? And third,

304
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,541
Antoñanzas.

305
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,041
Antoñanzas?

306
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,083
Inspector?

307
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:55,958
Okay. Donuts, licorice, lollipops,
and that melon-shaped gum.

308
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,875
My hormones are all over the place

309
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,878
and I need to seem like a sweet,
empathetic woman

310
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,708
when I talk to that fucking Professor.
How's that sound?

311
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,208
Everything's peachy.
I leave you in charge.

312
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,541
Okay. Come on.

313
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:14,833
Martínez.

314
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,708
Inspector, we're trying
to triangulate the calls.

315
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,958
Inspector.

316
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,375
<i>What country was he detained in?
Why was he brought in a secret plane?</i>

317
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,791
The pregnant woman who tortures.

318
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,708
Even the monkeys from Madagascar
are going to know about me.

319
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,416
He fell like a rag doll.

320
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,041
Go and get me some chewing gum.

321
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,500
ALLEGED ILLEGAL INTERROGATION

322
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,833
I look fat.

323
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,291
I look fat.

324
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:48,750
Yesterday, we were discussing how to
buy time if we're arrested here, in Spain.

325
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:52,416
But what happens
if we're able to rob the Royal Mint,

326
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,083
escape with the money,
and then, after some time,

327
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,666
Interpol arrests us in a foreign country?

328
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:02,125
In all likelihood,
they will hold us in that country to...

329
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:07,041
well, to make use of what they call
enhanced interrogation techniques.

330
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Torture.

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,958
The only good news is that

332
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,750
at a certain time,
we can use it to our advantage.

333
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,791
Using torture to our advantage? Cool.
How come I didn't think of that?

334
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,333
Even if they sidestep the law,

335
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:23,256
even if they sidestep the laws
guaranteeing our rights, sooner or later,

336
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:28,166
they have to bring us back to Spain,
and that means transfers, vans.

337
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:32,083
That's the moment in which
you have to look completely destroyed,

338
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,726
because there's always someone looking.

339
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:37,291
And if the people see and feel
that brutality...

340
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,916
that's when we have
our chance to negotiate.

341
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,458
Did you come from the bathroom?

342
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,458
Yes.

343
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:52,250
Did you go to deposit your solid detritus
at 12:00 p.m. in the shared bathroom?

344
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,750
To shit? Yes. Is there any problem?

345
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,125
That's the bathroom we all use,
what if I have to go now?

346
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,458
Then light a match, for fuck's sake.

347
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:05,541
Or cover your nose with that finger
you always have up your ass

348
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,791
and that makes you be so standoffish.
You have options.

349
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,083
Do you know what smell is?
Smells are particles.

350
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,583
Particles that were in the grime
of your intestines,

351
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:18,083
placidly flying around and they got out...

352
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,625
with your detritus, through your anus,
laying waste to everything!

353
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,500
And now I have to accept it
going into my nose?

354
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,041
Then, cover your fucking nose.

355
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,375
What, you don't shit?

356
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:32,458
Every day, religiously, like a watch,
but in the wee hours of the morning.

357
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:35,875
First, because of privacy,
but especially, out of respect...

358
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,375
- Respect, you say?
- Out of respect.

359
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,916
I don't think anyone has to inhale
the particles of my shit.

360
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,250
Let's not get too refined.

361
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,253
If we start with the taboo
against taking a dump,

362
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,166
we'll end up calling each other "mister."

363
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,291
- I like to be called "mister."
- What a surprise.

364
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,375
Look.

365
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,750
I know I am not
an elegant man like you, mister.

366
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,333
I know I don't know
as many things as you do, mister.

367
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:05,958
And I only know how to open holes where
not even God would dare to open them.

368
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,666
But most importantly,

369
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:12,083
I would risk my life for my people,
if it were necessary.

370
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,333
And the question is...

371
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,375
are you part of my team or not?

372
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,708
The question is
if I would risk my life for you.

373
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,000
That's the question.

374
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:31,333
The answer is that, despite your habits
learned in a shit-hole boarding school

375
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,583
and your fondness for crosswords,
if we go into the Mint together...

376
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,125
we'll get out together.

377
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,291
So, are we all friends again? Yes?

378
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,166
Great.

379
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,958
What we were talking about
is very important.

380
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:08,666
We all run the risk of being arrested.

381
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,333
Let's see.

382
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:21,541
Palermo?
Can you see anything with that eye?

383
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,791
I see your Russian Orthodox beard,
fucking Serbian.

384
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,916
Or is it Jeremiah Johnson's beard?

385
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,400
What I don't see is the fucking mule.
Where did you leave it?

386
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,458
I can see fine, fatty.

387
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:34,583
Let's see the other eye.

388
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:50,083
Don't worry. Your eye needs to heal.
It will be better tomorrow.

389
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,708
Let's put the patch on.

390
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,666
I'm going to grab a cane.

391
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,041
Palermo, are you there?

392
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,940
Eagle eye! I'm listening, Professor.

393
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Is Tokyo there?

394
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,125
Yes, she's here.

395
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Professor.

396
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,125
Tokyo...

397
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,500
Rio is in Spain.

398
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,083
Thank you.

399
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,541
I hope I'll be able to hug you...

400
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,125
<i>and thank you in person very soon.</i>

401
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,208
Of course you will.

402
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:17,000
<i>Tokyo, we still have to do the most
difficult part, but we'll get it done.</i>

403
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,916
We'll get it done.

404
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:33,958
<i>All actions,</i>

405
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,916
<i>all of them,</i>

406
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,250
<i>have consequences.</i>

407
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,041
<i>And the police...</i>

408
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:39,958
Colonel!

409
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,541
<i>...in the darkest time,</i>

410
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,291
<i>were going to see a light.</i>

411
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,416
- We're starting to triangulate the signal.
- Like a mobile phone?

412
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,166
It isn't as precise, by a long shot.

413
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,166
UIT has receivers everywhere in Spain.

414
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,250
The signal turns up in Galicia,
Alicante and even the rest of Europe.

415
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,083
But it emits more intensively
from the south of the peninsula.

416
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:00,791
- I think they're transmitting from there.
- How precise is this?

417
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,041
This is the radius.

418
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,916
He's running the robbery from the beach?
On holiday with his cousin Rosita?

419
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,833
Come on!

420
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:14,583
It doesn't make sense for him to be close.
He did this in the previous robbery, sir.

421
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,500
He will take for granted that we'll search
every building in the area.

422
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,500
So they went to Portugal,
Andalusia, Morocco?

423
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,208
Every place is safer than Madrid.

424
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,666
He only needs a phone and a radio.

425
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,291
Colonel, he knows our protocols.

426
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:32,286
And there aren't any about investigating
a robbery with hostages 400 miles away

427
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,750
from the crime scene.

428
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,708
What happens if you go there?

429
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,375
- Well, the area is still very wide.
- Fuck that, Angel!

430
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:43,208
- We need to narrow it down.
- Go there, right now!

431
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,375
And absolute discretion.

432
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,500
I would rather have you there

433
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,625
than a couple of Civil Guards
from a small town

434
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,125
that would only scare them away.

435
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,333
Martínez! Come here!

436
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,416
Yes.

437
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,125
You're going to work with him.

438
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,250
Study this signal exclusively.
Only this one.

439
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,583
Okay.

440
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,041
And this stays between us.
Don't tell anyone.

441
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,250
I would love to do a trip like this
with you some weekend.

442
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,708
I mean, without having to rob anything.

443
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,333
Yes, it could be our honeymoon.

444
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,625
Yes.

445
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,958
Well, for that we would need
to marry first.

446
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,541
Well, I'm already living with your mother.
Marrying you wouldn't be an issue.

447
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:43,625
Excuse me?

448
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,208
- What the fuck was that?
- Excuse me?

449
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:51,958
Marrying you wouldn't be an issue?
Are you fucking kidding with that?

450
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,666
You're just put it out there
and then puss out?

451
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,250
- It was just a comment.
- Forget it.

452
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,208
Forget it, because you're making it worse.

453
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,291
Call Marseille.

454
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,541
Yes.

455
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,625
Hey...

456
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,916
if you want to marry me,

457
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,041
ask for my hand properly.

458
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,916
Look for a place to pull over.

459
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,458
PRIETO

460
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,208
Inspector. It's him.

461
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,958
Professor.

462
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,583
Inspector Sierra? What a joy!
I was looking forward to talking with you.

463
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,791
Yes, I know you like to negotiate
with policewomen.

464
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,750
Aren't you going to ask me
what I'm wearing?

465
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,791
I imagine maternity clothes.

466
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,208
Oh, how old-fashioned you are!

467
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Are you one of those men
who wear undershirts?

468
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,458
Actually, I am, but...

469
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,833
Inspector, the classics never die.
Don't you think?

470
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,125
Alas, you can look like Pablo Escobar
with an undershirt

471
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,958
or like Marlon Brando
in <i>A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

472
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,416
Touché.

473
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,875
Tell me, then.

474
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,250
Have you ever recorded yourself
making love?

475
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,166
Let me think...

476
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,666
No, the truth is I haven't.

477
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:57,416
I guess I've always had qualms about it
because I'm a shy man.

478
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,125
In that case, I can help you.

479
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,166
Raquel!

480
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,950
You are listening, aren't you?

481
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,833
Raquel?

482
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,541
Hello, Alicia. Long time no see.

483
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,875
A long time, yes.

484
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,375
I'm surprised your Professor is too shy
to ask you to record yourselves

485
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,666
<i>having sex.</i>

486
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,791
<i>You did it in the second year of Academy.</i>

487
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,666
With Hortigosa. Fuck!

488
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,541
Alicia, you disappoint me.

489
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,958
<i>Listen.</i>

490
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,641
I'm going to tell you what you're doing.

491
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,208
You're trying to take control
of the conversation

492
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:39,583
with a friendly disposition, and then
you will drop a bomb to try to divide us.

493
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,750
Negotiations 101.

494
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,541
Not at all.
I was only entertaining myself.

495
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,458
I'm dropping the bomb now.

496
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:54,250
You've been classified as terrorists,
so I got the CIA, Interpol,

497
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,291
<i>and fucking everyone searching
for your mother and your daughter.</i>

498
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,500
<i>I don't know where they are,</i>

499
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,958
but I'm guessing you didn't run away
to Norway,

500
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,833
but to an idyllic country
with a poor, inefficient police force.

501
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,958
South Asia, for example.

502
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,000
That's what I would do.

503
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,958
Do you know what's bad
about those countries, Raquel?

504
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,958
You tell me, Alicia.

505
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,000
The jails.

506
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,208
<i>They're disgusting.</i>

507
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,125
<i>Overcrowding, infections...</i>

508
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,041
<i>drugs and killings.</i>

509
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,333
<i>All kinds of things,
and your mother is there!</i>

510
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,791
With her age and how confused she is.
And Paula?

511
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,625
Little Paula?

512
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,291
<i>I can delay an extradition
for a long time,</i>

513
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,750
<i>I can't imagine her there,
crying every night</i>

514
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,000
in an orphanage in Jakarta.
Damn, poor girl.

515
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,666
<i>Congratulations, Raquel. Great job.
You won a wimp.</i>

516
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,250
I'm sure he's one of those who only want
sex once a month, and you lost a family.

517
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,458
If you hand over the Professor,
I will leave them alone.

518
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,083
Why did you tell her that?

519
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:17,041
Because this is a card game,
and I went all-in.

520
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,083
And now they will be fucked for a while.
And that's what the game is about.

521
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:22,875
Screwing someone.

522
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,000
Calm down.

523
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,041
- It was a bluff.
- You called and you lost control.

524
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,500
You took my control away.

525
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,750
She was playing you.
She manipulated you.

526
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:57,666
Me?

527
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,416
- And you were smiling like a puppet!
- She manipulated you!

528
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,875
She hung up
and we didn't even play our cards.

529
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,208
She went after you
because you're the weak link.

530
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:42,833
Hey, mutt!

531
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:44,708
Bring me water.

532
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:45,791
What did you call me?

533
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,625
Mutt.

534
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:54,500
But I can also call you doner kebab,
gypsy or melon seller.

535
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:59,666
Do you want to go nose-to-nose with me
and piss me off?

536
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,750
I don't.

537
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:04,708
I don't even want to think of the number
of asses that nose has been in.

538
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,250
You're Gandía. Aren't you?

539
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,458
Is it just me or is there
a lot of negativity in the air?

540
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,208
Very bad vibes.

541
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,708
Take me to him, I want to talk to him.

542
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,083
Leave us alone.

543
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,208
He's sitting in front of you.

544
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,333
I smell sulfur.

545
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,166
I don't see very well, but...

546
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,750
I'm developing other senses.

547
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,375
And my intuition tells me
that you don't respect us.

548
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,583
It's what jerks with masks deserve.

549
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,208
They don't command respect.

550
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,625
A logical thought coming
from someone of your position,

551
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,541
but you're wrong about me.

552
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,333
You watched too much TV.
Do you think we're Robin Hood?

553
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,458
That we're adorable teddy bears
with Dalí masks?

554
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:32,166
What I think is that you're a <i>sudaca,</i>
one-eyed, faggot son of a bitch.

555
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,416
<i>Sudaca.</i>

556
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,166
Yes, I'm <i>sudaca.</i> That's true.

557
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,500
But I'm from the German school. Berlin's.

558
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,833
Don't move!

559
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,791
I love <i>piñatas.</i>

560
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:52,958
Don't move!

561
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,208
Son of a bitch!

562
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,958
- Palermo!
- Don't move! Don't move!

563
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:01,500
I am the <i>sudaca </i>that's going to repatriate
the gold you plundered, asshole.

564
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,166
Denver, stop him!

565
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,750
Palermo! Denver, stop him!

566
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:10,833
Gold bathed in American blood!
Satanic, ritualistic!

567
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,666
- Fucking reptile!
- Stop!

568
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,750
Better kill me. If not, I'm going
to rip your intestines out of your ass

569
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,250
- with a pair of pliers.
- I'm going to kill him!

570
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,041
Son of a bitch! Come here!

571
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,125
I'm going to kill you!

572
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,583
Nobody move!

573
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:27,000
Come here and hit me harder!
Hit me harder! Son of a bitch!

574
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:30,625
Son of a bitch! Come here!

575
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:35,083
You've put us on the same fucking level
as the Taliban.

576
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,291
What were you trying to prove?

577
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,750
Authority?

578
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,583
Beating up a guy that's tied down?

579
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,625
You only proved
that you're a piece of shit!

580
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:48,583
Then untie him and I'll beat him up with
just one hand! That fucker, bring him!

581
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,958
This fucking psycho
is who the Professor put in charge?

582
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:55,916
No, no, no. Listen to me, Palermo.
Here we have a plan and we have rules.

583
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,791
The Professor's rules.

584
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:59,541
And he's the one in charge.

585
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:04,791
Where the fuck is the Professor?
Where is Mr. Professor? He's never here!

586
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,083
Raise your hand if you have
the scepter of command!

587
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,500
I have the scepter of command!
I'm the one in charge!

588
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,708
Easy, easy.

589
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:25,208
I'm going to explain something to you
about the rules,

590
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,291
the son of a thousand bitches

591
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:35,000
who dares to insult any member
of the team, I will break his skull.

592
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,208
And you, mutt, you will stay silent.
Did you hear me?

593
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,458
Unless you want to open your mouth
to thank me

594
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,125
because I defended you,
for example. What do you say?

595
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:53,625
I don't need a piece of crap like you
to defend me.

596
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:57,625
Don't you realize that in the same way
you've beaten up a defenseless guy,

597
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,250
I could grab my rifle, crack your skull,
leave you fucked...

598
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,333
and take charge.

599
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,208
Really?

600
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,541
Helsinki, tie her up.

601
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:15,500
Tie up her hands and feet, and take her
to the forge for mutiny. Right now.

602
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,625
Don't even think about it. Helsi, Helsi!

603
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,125
- Nairobi.
- Helsi.

604
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,208
"Helsi?"

605
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,541
"Oh, Helsi." Sorry.

606
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:33,083
I think you're addressing him from
your emotional backpack. Am I right?

607
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:39,083
Do you really think
you can be Helsinki's woman?

608
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:47,208
What, Nairobi?
Following an impossible love? Why is that?

609
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:52,958
Are you lying to yourself?
Or do you want to play mommy?

610
00:43:56,375 --> 00:44:01,458
I regret to inform you the only role
you can assume now is the faggot's friend.

611
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,291
You're the fucking fag hag.
I'm sorry. Helsinki loves me.

612
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,625
I'm sorry.

613
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:11,458
Let me tell you something that you need
to know, because you're old enough.

614
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,583
In the relationships of love,
we have the lover and the beloved.

615
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:21,875
The lover lives the relationship
with passion, devotion, and romanticism.

616
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,291
The beloved...

617
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,791
simply enjoys being worshiped.

618
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,220
I'm not saying being a lover
is a bad thing.

619
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,875
Don't get me wrong, please.

620
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,125
But do you know what?

621
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,750
Lovers suffer a lot, dear.

622
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,875
Whereas, I have my fun.

623
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,708
The only yield I get is sex.

624
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:45,845
It's the fucking law of love, Nairobi.
I'm sorry. It's the way it is.

625
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:56,166
The only miserable one
in this whole story...

626
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
is you.

627
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:03,250
With your speech about love,
and "Boom, boom,<i> ciao."</i> Wow.

628
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:08,583
That's because...
you are too coward to admit the truth.

629
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,875
The only truth is the reality.

630
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:17,458
And I'm going to explain it to you.
Look. You love fatty.

631
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,583
Fatty loves me.

632
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,541
And I don't love anyone.
And that's precisely why...

633
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,458
you hate me.

634
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,333
You don't love anyone?

635
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,166
Of course you don't, darling.

636
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,833
You don't have the balls for it.

637
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,833
To love you need courage.

638
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,041
I have courage. Look.

639
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,625
Helsi.

640
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:50,583
I love you. I love you so much...

641
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,750
that I would have a family with you.

642
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,583
See? This is bravery.

643
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,666
I feel it and I say it.

644
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:06,708
And that...

645
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,500
you don't know how to do.

646
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:11,291
How long has it been?

647
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:15,208
Ten years? You were in love
with Berlin for ten years?

648
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,750
And you never dared to tell him.

649
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:25,208
Of course. You worshiped him
and followed him like a dog.

650
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:27,666
And that's it.

651
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:30,875
Now what?

652
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,875
Nothing is possible now.

653
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,541
He's dead.

654
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,500
And you're empty.

655
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:46,166
The only thing you can do is hide
behind that damn speech. Boom, boom,<i> ciao.</i>

656
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,333
Because you know.

657
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:53,958
You've been left
in the lurch forever, friend.

658
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,791
Let's get back to work.
