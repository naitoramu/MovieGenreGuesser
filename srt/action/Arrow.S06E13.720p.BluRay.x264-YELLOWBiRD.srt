1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,330
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,835
You would be remiss in forgetting
the thermobaric explosive that remains

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,006
in my possession.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,209
What do you want?

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,714
Vengeance for my son.

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,135
- What'd you find?
- Video of his son's murder.

7
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,137
This is fabricated. It didn't happen.

8
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,391
Whoever planned this
knew exactly how Cayden would react.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,187
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

10
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,263
Do you trust me?

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,814
I need you here for a
rather important assignment.

12
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,861
- What's that?
- Rooting out a traitor.

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,036
- Baby, please wake up.
- He's gone, D.

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,375
We're clear.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,753
All right. Keep moving.

16
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,801
I guess Cayden James and friends
knew we were coming.

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,760
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

18
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,471
<i>Once I learned of Mr. Sobel's treachery,</i>

19
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,430
<i>I had to assume
this location was compromised.</i>

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,147
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

21
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,985
<i>I didn't appreciate your alliance
with him.</i>

22
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,610
<i>Made me think we no longer have
an understanding.</i>

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,034
- You need to know something.
<i>- Many things, I'm sure.</i>

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,114
<i>But I doubt very much that
you're the man to teach them to me.</i>

25
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,995
We almost have proof
that I didn't kill your son.

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,997
<i>A desperate gambit.</i>

27
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,124
Cayden, give me more time.

28
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,915
<i>Time, I'm afraid,</i>

29
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,668
<i>is a commodity you and your city</i>

30
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,214
<i>have run out of.</i>

31
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,889
<i>Mr. Sobel's betrayal convinced me
that there's little good</i>

32
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,887
<i>in delaying matters further.</i>

33
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,388
<i>Accordingly,</i>

34
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,475
<i>I will be detonating
the thermobaric bomb</i>

35
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,773
<i>over Star City at midnight.</i>

36
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,729
<i>My son will find justice in the ashes
of your beloved city.</i>

37
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,162
ARROW

38
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,748
Cayden is going to detonate the bomb
in four hours.

39
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,998
Where are we with the video?

40
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,421
Well, we're running
a photographic analysis algorithm

41
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,793
to reveal the original footage.

42
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,004
- How long will that take?
- As long as it takes.

43
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,380
The algorithm Felicity and Curtis wrote

44
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,461
works wonders on a still image

45
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,091
but this is 24 fps video
we're talking about here, so...

46
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,552
Right. Cayden just told us that
we're running out of time.

47
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,179
There's something you should consider.

48
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,683
You're putting all of your chips down
on a bet that he'll spare this city

49
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,560
if he thinks you're not responsible
for his son's death.

50
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,892
That's because that's
the only play we have, Alena.

51
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,153
I'm just saying you might be
trying to reason with a man

52
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,274
who's beyond reason.

53
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,368
As you are well aware,
Arclight is now in its final phase.

54
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,492
And now it's time for us
to take our leave.

55
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,871
Words much appreciated.
But how are we to get out of city?

56
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,536
Stay close to your phones.

57
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,460
You'll be airlifted from the city
before the bomb goes off.

58
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,208
After it does,

59
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,921
your individual shares of the ransom
will be wired into offshore accounts

60
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,721
that have been set up for each of you.

61
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,052
Sounds fair.

62
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,425
Lucrative.

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,556
Indeed.

64
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,481
Thank you for helping
to see this project to fruition.

65
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,018
I don't think I need to stress

66
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,822
how personally important

67
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,735
this has been for me.

68
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,322
Thank you for all you've done

69
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,491
to get justice for my boy.

70
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,374
Mr. James.

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,052
Just as Alexander reigned destruction
on Persepolis,

72
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,637
so do I now,

73
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,350
on Averwood Pharmaceuticals.

74
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,644
$50 million

75
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,523
from illegal black market drug deals.

76
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,235
And I just made it all

77
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,413
disappear.

78
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,080
You must be our new recruit.

79
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,209
Kojo Sledgehammer, if I recall.

80
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,667
I am...
I am so stoked to be here, Mr. James.

81
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,842
This is just...

82
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,840
You are an absolute legend.

83
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,261
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

84
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,478
I'm sure we'll all do
great things together.

85
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,354
Owen.

86
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,366
See you guys tomorrow.

87
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,864
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, that was quite a game.

88
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,574
Please don't lie, okay?

89
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,125
I could see you weren't in the stands.

90
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,378
Mom told me you didn't show.

91
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,997
Where's your mother now?

92
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,301
She and Jim went to have dinner
at some fancy French restaurant.

93
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,212
Jim got a promotion.
He said he wanted to treat her.

94
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,846
That's considerate of him.

95
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,769
So sorry I missed the game, Owen.

96
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,805
I got delayed at work.

97
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,485
Is that what we're supposed to call
your weirdo hacker group?

98
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,442
The work we do is important.
It benefits people

99
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,522
all over the world.

100
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,653
Yeah. Work you won't even tell me about.

101
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,489
As I've said,
that's for your protection.

102
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,496
Look, I know I'm not
the easiest person in the world

103
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,572
to talk to.

104
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,200
But,

105
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,794
I do want to be a bigger part
of your life.

106
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,996
I truly do.

107
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,589
You can't have it both ways, Dad.

108
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,508
You can't say you want to be a part
of my life

109
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,926
and keep me out of yours.

110
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,640
When are the finals?

111
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,056
- Tomorrow night.
- I will be there.

112
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,400
I can't share with you
all the details of my work,

113
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,198
but I vow to do a better job
of sharing your life.

114
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,160
And that begins tomorrow.

115
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,328
Yes. Yes, exactly. Please.

116
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,334
Listen. We need SCPD radios linked

117
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,507
with emergency services right now, okay?

118
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,583
Now.

119
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,176
Where the hell are you?

120
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,551
Did you get my message?

121
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,631
Yeah. I'm okay. We rallied the troops
and everyone's panicking a little.

122
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,717
Gather a list of essential personnel

123
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,894
clergymen, doctors, as many people
as you can mobilize.

124
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,767
How... How are we gonna explain

125
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,598
how you have access
to the Arrow's bunker?

126
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,934
We have bigger problems right now,
Speedy. It's...

127
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,023
Besides, this is the only place
in the city I can think of

128
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,070
that can possibly withstand that blast.

129
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,028
You have eyes on...

130
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,235
- William. Of course. I've got it.
- Thank you.

131
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,700
Do you have to keep doing that?

132
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,619
Keeps me calm.

133
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,535
Do not worry.

134
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,913
Cayden James will not let
his friends die with the city.

135
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,335
You're damn right.

136
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,717
And I'm not gonna stick around
to find out.

137
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,252
Where are you going?

138
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,262
Some place I won't get blown up.

139
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,966
Two of you haven't noticed,

140
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,888
the airlift that Cayden promised,

141
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,887
it's more than a little late.

142
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,477
I hate to say it,
but I think he's right.

143
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,026
I notice that Dinah didn't show up
for work today.

144
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,775
Well, after what happened to Sobel,
you really expecting her to?

145
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,778
No. I just...
If from what Oliver told me, I...

146
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,778
I don't really think that
she's exactly just grieving.

147
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,572
You think Oliver would just... What?
Let Dinah kill her?

148
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,785
No. I...

149
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,622
I just don't think that
that's what's on his mind right now.

150
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:42,993
Right.

151
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,664
Well, you know, if it comes down
to Laurel against Dinah,

152
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,916
Laurel's not the one I'm worried about.

153
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,151
Tell me where I can find Black Siren

154
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,480
or the next bone I break is your neck.

155
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,279
Lady, if I knew
where any of those guys were going,

156
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,530
I'd be with them.

157
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,707
I guess that's one way
to not get information.

158
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,034
What are you two doing here?

159
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,494
Looking for you.

160
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,287
SCPD says you weren't in today.

161
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,296
We were wondering if you were
gonna do something stupid.

162
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,373
Guess we were wrong.

163
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,254
I'm looking for her

164
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,714
to get justice for Vincent.

165
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,343
Why do you say justice
like it's cold-blooded murder?

166
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,517
I know you're hurting, D.

167
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,348
But Felicity called.

168
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,932
We've got till midnight before James
lets his bomb do its thing.

169
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,142
As much as we feel for you,

170
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,644
that seems like the priority.

171
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,947
He's right. Now's not the time
to go off the deep end.

172
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,023
I can't let this go.

173
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,528
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:56,942
D.

175
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,113
I love you both,

176
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,281
but stay the hell out of my way.

177
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,714
We need to consider
the A.R.G.U.S. airlift option.

178
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,212
Oliver, we've already talked
about this. James will see it coming.

179
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,545
We need to consider something.

180
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,258
- Got it.
- What?

181
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,514
I've seen this. It's bogus.

182
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,936
You said you had something.

183
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,187
Yeah. The whole thing was
a massive deception.

184
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,816
Owen was never collateral damage
like Cayden was made to think.

185
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,689
He was the real target the whole time.

186
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,105
Who is that?

187
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,366
Facial recognition just picked him up
as Carl Iskoff.

188
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,442
Paid assassin.

189
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,612
- With bow and arrow?
- Bow and arrow is not his usual MO.

190
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,622
I'm guessing it was a special request
by whoever hired him

191
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,620
- to kill Cayden's son.
- All to set you up.

192
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,749
We need to have a conversation
with this Iskoff.

193
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,828
Find out who hired him.

194
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,080
He's dead.

195
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,456
What?

196
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The assassin was assassinated

197
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,376
not long after Owen Post.

198
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,882
We need to know where Cayden James is
right now.

199
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,049
Got him.

200
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm guessing Cayden doesn't care
about people knowing his location

201
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,555
now that his bomb is about to go off.

202
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,811
He's almost on the I-86.

203
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,191
He's psycho but he's smart.

204
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,484
I mean, he doesn't wanna be anywhere
near the boom

205
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,560
when the bomb goes boom.

206
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,020
We'll never catch him.

207
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,563
I have an idea.

208
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,867
We need to talk.

209
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,209
Questionable judgment, Mr. Queen.

210
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,254
If you wanted the bomb to go off
before midnight,

211
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,336
you'd be hard-pressed to come up
with a better way

212
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,295
than taking me into custody.

213
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,382
Watch this.

214
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,559
Would that be the proof
that you alluded to earlier?

215
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,803
Just play the video.

216
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,188
No. I'm not watching this again.

217
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,440
No, Cayden.

218
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,070
You're not.

219
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,448
You're watching the real video

220
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,235
for the very first time.

221
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,914
Oliver didn't kill your son.

222
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,787
Which means someone else did.

223
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,001
The assassin's name is Carl Iskoff.

224
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,505
He was instructed
to use a bow and arrow,

225
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,505
so the video could be manipulated,
and they could make it look like me.

226
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,089
It's the same tech used to out Oliver
as the Green Arrow, four months ago.

227
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,685
Someone's gone through a lot of work
to put you two on a collision course.

228
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,520
Oh, yes.

229
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,526
Someone within my organization.

230
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,859
How do you know?

231
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,984
The metadata on the forged video file

232
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,783
confirms it as the
work of the same person

233
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,202
who manipulated that photo in October.

234
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,741
You lost a man a month ago.

235
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,374
Killed by the traitorous Mr. Sobel,
but I highly doubt it was Mr. Sheck.

236
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,253
- That leaves Laurel? Diaz?
- And Anatoly?

237
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,210
I'd like to speak
to my former colleagues.

238
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,342
And that's where the two of you come in.

239
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,544
No.

240
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,051
We're not rounding
them up to be executed.

241
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,058
No, I just want a pointed conversation.

242
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,681
Bring them to me. All three. Alive.

243
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,264
Otherwise, I'll have no choice
but to stay the course.

244
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,816
I still have a very powerful bomb.

245
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,607
And I'd be perfectly happy
to take out Star City

246
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,189
right along with whoever orchestrated
the death of my son.

247
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,918
You gotta be kidding me.

248
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,461
Please tell me you're kidding me.

249
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,254
The only way to stop James
from destroying the city

250
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,707
is by delivering him these people.

251
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,167
Lead them to the slaughter, you mean.

252
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,004
- We won't let that happen.
- Right now, that's our only option.

253
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,679
You don't even know for sure
that one of them did it.

254
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,097
I mean, none of them
were working for Cayden

255
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,173
when he received the video.

256
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,934
They were working for him
when he received the doctored photo.

257
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,636
It has to be one of those people, Alena.

258
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,064
It is either Diaz,
Anatoly or Black Siren.

259
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,233
You hope. What if Cayden is lying?

260
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,439
Well, we've got
bigger problems then that.

261
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,192
I mean, what makes you think that
we can find Cayden's BFFs,

262
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,272
if he can't?

263
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,153
If they're smart,
they're out of the city by now.

264
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,109
They're smart, but so is he.

265
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,786
He grouped them together by promising
to fly them out before the blast.

266
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,911
Thank goodness for small
favors and gullible bad guys.

267
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,994
By now, they're worried that James
might not make good on that promise.

268
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,333
Raisa wanted to go
to one of the city shelters,

269
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,293
so she could be with her family.

270
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,625
What's going on? Why do we have
to leave the safe house?

271
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,710
We'll talk about it later, buddy.

272
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,591
You promised
you won't lie to me anymore.

273
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,926
Cayden James is threatening
to detonate a large bomb

274
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,010
in Star City

275
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,016
and this is the safest place for you.

276
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,764
That is the truth.

277
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,851
- Alena.
- Yeah. We're running facial recog

278
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,231
and Cayden gave us
back satellite control.

279
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,858
Our usual tricks aren't working.

280
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,941
Oliver, we need the rest of the team.

281
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,067
Agreed.

282
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,663
- Where are you going?
- Need to go look for a few people.

283
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,740
Let me come with you.

284
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,244
I need you to stay here.

285
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,953
I wanna stay with you.

286
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,914
It is too dangerous out there.

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,290
Bottom line.

288
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,759
I'll be back as soon as I can be.

289
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,009
You have any luck?

290
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,348
Did you think I would?

291
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,056
She was pretty clear about
where she stood, hoss.

292
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,353
So, basically the city
is gonna get destroyed

293
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,729
and our friend is gonna commit murder

294
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,230
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about either?

295
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,948
- Well timed, D.
- Different kinda D, Hoss.

296
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,702
Sorry, John.

297
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,495
We've gotten some
place with Cayden James.

298
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,165
He won't detonate his bomb, if we
bring back Anatoly, Diaz and Laurel.

299
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,287
Alive.

300
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,210
So, no honor amongst thieves?

301
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,916
Well, let's just say
he has a good reason

302
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,623
to think at least one of those
is responsible for his son's death.

303
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,668
We can use your help finding them.

304
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,924
If we do it,
we should go after Laurel first.

305
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,347
Dinah's after her.
If she gets to her before we do...

306
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,423
D's gonna kill her.

307
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,968
And if she does that,

308
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,519
she might be killing the whole city.

309
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,531
Vince told me
you had a to-go bag stashed.

310
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,958
Took me a little while
to figure out where.

311
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,642
You can't stop me.

312
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,062
This ends tonight.

313
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,847
You end tonight.

314
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,931
No.

315
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,730
You stay out of this.

316
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,565
I can't let you hurt her.

317
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,110
Hi, Daddy. Missed you.

318
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,196
I told you.

319
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:58,697
This ends tonight.

320
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,303
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

321
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,844
What are you doing?

322
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,179
I had her.

323
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,976
I'm saving the city.

324
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,067
I cannot believe you are working
with Cayden James.

325
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,318
It's not like that, D.

326
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,400
He wants Anatoly, Diaz and Laurel.

327
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,534
- Alive.
- Or boom goes the city.

328
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,200
Just saying, that's
a pretty good reason to not kill her,

329
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,327
besides, you know,
all the other good reasons

330
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,874
like, killing is bad.

331
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,036
I can hold off for a little while.

332
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,370
Dinah.

333
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,584
- We do not just execute people.
- No.

334
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,381
You just let them die.

335
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,259
Can we continue this later?

336
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,136
Anatoly and Diaz are still in the wind.

337
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,888
Correction.
Ricardo Diaz was in the wind.

338
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,639
Cayden's satellite just picked him up
headed south.

339
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,053
Our team can take down Diaz.

340
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,481
Okay. I'm sending you
the GPS co-ordinates now.

341
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,606
I'm staying here.

342
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,479
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

343
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,563
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

344
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,696
So, what? We're letting the foxes guard
the hen houses now?

345
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,444
Quentin, Canary,

346
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,162
you keep eyes on Black Siren.

347
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,083
Wild Dog, Terrific, you go after Diaz.

348
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,832
Overwatch, let us know when you
have eyes on Anatoly,

349
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,629
and Spartan and I will be ready to move.

350
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,001
Put me through to Cayden.

351
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,386
Mr. Queen.
Have you fulfilled my request?

352
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,216
We have Black Siren.
Where do we take her?

353
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,472
The last time I checked,
it took more than one songbird

354
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,636
to make up a trio.

355
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,642
Cayden, we don't have time for games.

356
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,395
Then I suggest you find
my former compatriots

357
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,976
as soon as you can.

358
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,534
Owen, before this night is over,
I promise to you,

359
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,666
we will render our judgment.

360
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,209
Where's my phone?

361
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,378
Ah.

362
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,881
- Are you heading out, Cayden?
- Yes, Alena.

363
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,432
Prior engagement. Must attend.

364
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,054
Well, are you sure that's a good idea?

365
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,140
Whatever do you mean?

366
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,679
Oh, uh...

367
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,766
I'm... I'm sorry. I just assumed
somebody would have told you.

368
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,273
I... I picked up some chatter
on your hacked A.R.G.U.S. responder

369
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,604
a few minutes ago about your takedown

370
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,906
of Averwood Pharmaceuticals.

371
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,446
My point being, it's just...
If A.R.G.U.S. has your scent,

372
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,404
maybe going out right now
isn't the best idea.

373
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,702
Probably not. But I'll take precautions.

374
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,829
Can't afford to break this date.

375
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,803
Leaving town?

376
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,178
You like that?

377
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,976
We got this off another pair
of doppelgangers.

378
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,726
You know, I have to say,

379
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,853
I was surprised.

380
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:18,444
Your boyfriend and his little magical
healing abilities.

381
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,569
You know, I thought it would be
harder to take him down,

382
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,650
but it wasn't.

383
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,734
What's going on?

384
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,657
I'm counting down the minutes.

385
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,697
What? Before you try
to kill my daughter again?

386
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,041
That is not your daughter.

387
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,910
That is a monster.

388
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,334
You gave your monster a second chance.

389
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,584
After he worked his ass off
to redeem himself.

390
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,796
And after he gave his life
to stop Cayden James.

391
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,303
You seriously wanna compare Vince
to Laurel? I...

392
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,968
I know. I know what she's done.

393
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,021
I'm not an idiot,

394
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,606
but no one deserves to die.

395
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,558
Not even her.

396
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,810
You're wrong.

397
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,779
And once this is all over,

398
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,195
if Cayden James doesn't kill her,

399
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,909
I sure as hell am gonna take my shot.

400
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,123
Where's my dad?

401
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,419
He said he'd be right back.

402
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,706
Um, yeah. I know.

403
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,086
And he will.

404
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,291
It's just that...

405
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,052
Things didn't really go
as he planned tonight,

406
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,596
the way any of us had planned, so...

407
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,135
Just taking a long time.

408
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,096
He's gonna be okay.

409
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,223
- Okay?
- Okay.

410
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,605
I've got eyes on Anatoly
and a few of his friends.

411
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,066
Looks like they've got themselves
a helicopter.

412
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,073
Next time I come back to City,
I hope it is ash.

413
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,246
<i>Kapushon!</i>

414
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,212
Show yourself.

415
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,640
City is about to become crater.

416
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,594
You want to put me in prison? Fine.

417
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,559
Just... Out of town, please.

418
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,690
Bomb's not going off, Anatoly.

419
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,310
Because I'm gonna deliver
Cayden James the truth.

420
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,853
You.

421
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,155
You have finally snapped.

422
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,905
Took few more years longer
than I expected.

423
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,819
You set me up.

424
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,697
Photo.

425
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,998
The doctored video.

426
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,658
I already told you.

427
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,538
That was not me.

428
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,167
Well, forgive me if I don't wanna
take you at your word.

429
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,958
Overwatch, we got him.

430
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,636
Curtis and Rene got Ricardo Diaz.
That makes us three for three.

431
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,051
William, give that to me.

432
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,220
Call James.

433
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,731
I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

434
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,517
We have all three.
Where do you want 'em?

435
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,274
<i>Meet me at the abandoned theater
on Jefferson Avenue.</i>

436
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,562
I'm on it.

437
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,572
- I'll call Curtis and Rene.
- I got Quentin.

438
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,116
I'll keep an eye on Cayden.

439
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,724
Prodigious timing, gentlemen.
It's almost midnight.

440
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,432
- Not here to play games, Cayden.
- Yet, here you are.

441
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,478
- And what of Mr. Diaz and Ms. Lance?
- They'll be here.

442
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,894
And what of this young man?

443
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,615
I don't believe your son
was invited, Oliver.

444
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,490
- What are you doing here?
- I wanna be with you. I'm scared.

445
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,947
- William, just listen to me...
- It's just like on the island.

446
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,121
Just like when my mom died.

447
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,534
I don't wanna lose you too.

448
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,669
- Please, I want to stay with you.
- Come here. Come here.

449
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,705
It's all right.

450
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,841
You stay right here.

451
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,637
It started with my son.

452
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,133
Yours should be here for the end.

453
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,386
It's a beautiful symmetry,
don't you think?

454
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,602
He has nothing to do with this.

455
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,853
I don't disagree.

456
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,027
But it appears your son has other plans.

457
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,228
Hello, William.

458
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,902
My name is Cayden James.

459
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,321
You're the guy who wants
to blow up the city.

460
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,693
I suppose.

461
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,777
It's a long story.

462
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,948
And it concerns my own son.

463
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,449
Where is he?

464
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,659
Passed away, I'm afraid.

465
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,635
<i>Cayden James.</i>

466
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,725
I was told to expect you.

467
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,769
Warned, in fact.

468
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,850
Mr. James, we're here to remand you
into custody

469
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,937
for multiple violations of federal law.

470
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,862
I strongly advise you not to resist.

471
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,617
My only son is playing in this game.

472
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,614
Could I perhaps watch it
before you take me in?

473
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,114
That's not how it works.

474
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,789
Just asking for few moments.
Little compassion here.

475
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,002
I strongly suggest
surrendering peacefully

476
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,290
to avoid a scene.

477
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,001
There's no need for that.

478
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,943
I'm gonna get a lay of the land.

479
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,745
She better be here when I get back.

480
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,368
I don't think she likes me.

481
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,829
Well, you haven't given her
much reason to, have you?

482
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,247
Fair.

483
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:16,963
She's right, you know.

484
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,513
- About what?
- I'm not like Sobel.

485
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,301
I'm not gonna change.

486
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:26,015
I'm not gonna just wake up one day
and... And be your Laurel.

487
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,020
No, no. You'll always be you.

488
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,353
But you can be better.

489
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,526
Why would I?

490
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,111
We live in an ugly world

491
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,820
and the only way to survive it is...
Is to be ugly right back.

492
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,905
- You're wrong, okay?
- Hey.

493
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,833
Has it ever occurred to you
that I like who I am?

494
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,044
That when I killed Sobel,
I actually enjoyed it?

495
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,884
And all those pictures that you
showed me of your daughter, this...

496
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,844
This... This woman
that I don't even recognize,

497
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,797
they made me sick.

498
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,347
She was soft and naive.

499
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,520
And that's why she's the one who's dead.

500
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,347
Why are you telling me this?

501
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,189
Because I don't ever wanna
find myself enjoying killing you.

502
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,146
Perimeter's secure.

503
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,823
- Let's move.
- Yeah.

504
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,497
Quite a brave young fellow
you have here, Mr. Queen.

505
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,451
Brave and foolish.

506
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,671
- Much like his father.
- Wait, wait. What's he doing here?

507
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,589
None of your concern, Mr. Lance.

508
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,126
Ah. And the rest of our guests
have arrived.

509
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:41,298
These two freaks say that you think
one of us killed your boy?

510
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,932
In point of fact, Mr. Diaz,

511
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,135
I know that one of you killed my boy.

512
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,970
I intend to find out who.

513
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,097
You believe people in masks,

514
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,771
over people you do business with?

515
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,101
I'm with the Russian.

516
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,402
I think these guys would do anything
to save their precious city.

517
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,449
I don't trust anyone's word, Mr. Diaz.

518
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,577
I put my faith in data.

519
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,199
Information.

520
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,577
Ones and zeros never lie.

521
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,664
This is digital proof that
one of you has betrayed me.

522
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,291
Come on, William.
Please just get out of there.

523
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,004
None of you know

524
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,428
what it feels like to lose a son.

525
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,598
A piece of yourself, gone.

526
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,220
It's like a phantom limb.
No. It's worse than that.

527
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,056
It's like a piece of your soul, lost.

528
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,649
As if it had never been there. No. Stop.

529
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,897
I keep reminding myself that...

530
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,563
I have not lost my son.

531
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,487
He's been taken from me.

532
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,567
Hey.

533
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,824
You're losing it.

534
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,697
Your grief,

535
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,078
it's making you crazy.

536
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,463
What if it has?

537
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,341
Just look at him. He wants to kill
everyone in this room.

538
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,845
- Just be ready to move.
- Okay. Screw this.

539
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,130
It was me.

540
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,674
I did it.

541
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,551
Surprise.

542
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,354
I'm the one who did it.

543
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,182
I killed your stupid kid.

544
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,814
- Oh, my God.
- What?

545
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,570
For the past three minutes,

546
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,069
Cayden's detonator has been emitting
a 76 GHz field.

547
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,742
- Now it's spiking.
- Okay. What does this mean?

548
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,153
It means there's something wrong
with the bomb.

549
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,082
It's a shame really. He was very cute.

550
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,913
Signal's fritzing again.
Closer Cayden gets to Laurel,

551
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,373
the bigger the frequency spikes
on the detonator.

552
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,457
No, it's not the detonator.

553
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,259
Aren't you gonna ask me why I did it?

554
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,631
No.

555
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,512
I know you're lying.

556
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,847
You're not nearly as callous
as you portray yourself to be.

557
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,645
I saw, Ms. Lance.

558
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:01,272
When I ordered you to execute
Mr. Sobel, I saw you hesitate.

559
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,066
You didn't wanna do it.

560
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,698
Oliver, you need to get Laurel
away from Cayden, right now.

561
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,872
<i>His detonator is interfering
with her power-dampening collar.</i>

562
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,588
Well, well, well.
Now this is interesting.

563
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,602
Laurel!

564
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,066
Guys, are you okay? Do you copy?

565
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,481
Overwatch, we're fine.

566
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,187
Okay, thermal imaging reads
everyone's still inside,

567
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,523
but they've gone
in different directions.

568
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,358
I'm good. Find Anatoly.

569
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,488
I've got Diaz. Go!

570
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,902
Sure thing, hoss.

571
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,951
- Knew this would happen.
- What?

572
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,661
We work with Oliver, we get in trouble.
The guy's a walking death trap.

573
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,915
Who do you think taught him about traps?

574
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,436
- Stop!
- God, you're persistent.

575
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,686
It's annoying.

576
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,630
Son of a bitch.

577
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,316
Dinah! No!

578
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,780
No!

579
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,717
Laurel! Laurel!

580
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,351
William?

581
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:45,859
William, back away, son.

582
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,361
Your son wouldn't want you to do this.

583
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,826
The person responsible
for his death is in the vicinity.

584
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,408
And I intend to drag them
to hell with me.

585
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,165
I owe it to my son.

586
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,205
Look at me.

587
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,091
You don't be afraid, all right?

588
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,798
I'm right here with you.

589
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,843
I love you very much.

590
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,508
William.

591
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,226
I had an obligation to protect my son.

592
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,650
It's a father's job
to protect your child.

593
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,692
But I failed.

594
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,615
I failed him, utterly.

595
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,031
All this time,

596
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,495
the man responsible for his death

597
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,915
was me.

598
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,888
Don't you move.

599
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,984
I can't believe he was ready
to blow up the whole city.

600
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,487
Yeah.

601
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,035
He lost his boy.

602
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,783
I don't even wanna...

603
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,948
Yeah.

604
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,578
What you did was very dangerous.

605
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,167
I know and I'm sorry.

606
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,971
I am never gonna let
anything happen to you, William.

607
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,965
Ever.

608
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,476
And I am promising you,
that I will do everything I can

609
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,554
to make sure nothing happens to me.

610
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,189
- You can't make that promise.
- I can make that promise.

611
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,601
I just did. I am. Right now.

612
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,440
Kiddo, I've been doing this a long time.

613
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,619
So trust me.

614
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,323
Okay?

615
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,492
Okay.

616
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,078
Thank you.

617
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,665
I gotta go talk to the others,
all right?

618
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay.

619
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:16,961
Where are we?

620
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,219
If by "we" you mean Anatoly,
Diaz and Laurel...

621
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,549
Completely in the wind.

622
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,680
- Again?
- Again.

623
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:27,021
Well, Quentin's walking Cayden James
to booking right now.

624
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,644
Look, I know what you're all gonna say

625
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,771
but I think finding Laurel
needs to be our first priority.

626
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,147
Don't make this personal, Dinah.

627
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,522
Or you know, more personal.

628
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,524
You heard her.

629
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,658
She is the one who had
Cayden James' son killed,

630
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,485
she was the one who set
all of this into motion.

631
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,663
- You don't know that.
- She confessed.

632
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,036
She was pushing James' buttons, D.

633
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,785
How did she manage
to blind all of you this much?

634
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,252
You're the one who's not seeing clearly,

635
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,328
if you ask me, Dinah.

636
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,663
I didn't.

637
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,249
Hey. Hey.

638
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,255
You're better than this.

639
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,678
- I guess we're leaving now.
- Yeah, we're leaving now.

640
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,769
Just to be clear, whatever happened
doesn't change anything.

641
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,560
Yeah, we're glad
we took down Cayden James,

642
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,736
but we're still doing our own thing.

643
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,237
Please try and keep Dinah in line.

644
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,196
No promises, hoss.

645
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,036
In case you haven't noticed

646
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,989
we're not having a lot of luck
with that right now.

647
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,706
Well, we saved the city again
and got Cayden James.

648
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,630
Yeah. Why doesn't that feel like we won?

649
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,141
I must say this visit
is somewhat predictable.

650
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,482
Well, I needed to look you
in the eyes, Cayden.

651
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:05,077
I need to know that
this surrender of yours

652
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,701
isn't some sort of ploy.

653
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,078
I've had bad luck with that tactic.

654
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,873
You prevented from doing
the unspeakable last night.

655
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,335
I'm sure Owen
would have been ashamed of me.

656
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,422
But then he always was.

657
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,262
These are my best guesses,

658
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,640
as to where you might find
my former allies,

659
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,103
along with the account number
to a bank in Corto Maltese

660
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,481
where I placed all the money
I embezzled from the city.

661
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,812
Thank you.

662
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,233
I would ask one thing in return,

663
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,783
permission to visit my son's grave.

664
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,657
I can arrange that.

665
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,545
Be a better father than I was, Oliver.

666
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:17,017
If this is another feeble attempt
to extract information from me,

667
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,274
I warn you, I will continue to invoke

668
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,777
my Fifth Amendment protections.

669
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,076
I'm very sorry
to have to tell you this, Mr. James,

670
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,909
but your son Owen
was found murdered last night.

671
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,994
No.

672
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,961
He's 18!

673
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,834
No!

674
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,336
Who would wanna hurt my boy?

675
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,967
I'm afraid we don't know.

676
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,596
I am truly very sorry, Cayden.

677
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,741
Hey.

678
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,660
What's your story, morning glory?

679
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,253
I used to say that to you
when you're a little girl, you know?

680
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,709
The other you.

681
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,882
- I already told you.
- I know what you told me.

682
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,631
What you told me was a lie.

683
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,054
James said it.

684
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,637
You hesitated when you killed Sobel.

685
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,518
So what if I did?

686
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,929
It means there's a piece,
maybe just a small piece

687
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:41,017
but it means that there is a piece
of my daughter in you, somewhere.

688
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,812
And I'm gonna get it out,
whatever it takes.

689
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,314
Didn't think we'd end up here.

690
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,652
SCPD custody.

691
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,191
You know, I saw this playing out
in a lot of ways.

692
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,118
But I gotta tell you

693
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,787
I wasn't expecting this.

694
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:43,121
I assume it would be foolish to think
that this is a rescue operation.

695
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,628
You're always the smartest guy
in the room.

696
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,470
You thought you always had
everybody pegged.

697
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,052
You've put everyone
in your little boxes,

698
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,428
you always understood
what they were thinking,

699
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,604
how they'd react.

700
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,772
But you're realizing now,

701
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,975
you didn't really know anything.

702
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,782
I'm afraid I don't take
your meaning, Mr. Diaz.

703
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,984
Is that so?

704
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,078
You're supposed to be the smart one.

705
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,336
You made some moves,

706
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,497
then I made some moves,

707
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,083
Queen is under indictment now.

708
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,715
His team is fractured
into million pieces.

709
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,758
And this city,

710
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,391
oh, this city,

711
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,975
it's prime for a takeover.

712
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,605
You see, guys like you
never understand these things.

713
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,146
Why destroy a city

714
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,699
when you could take it over?

715
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,581
I suppose this accounts
for your presence here.

716
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,087
The new police captain,
she's on my payroll,

717
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,167
along with a few other city officials.

718
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,262
Arclight

719
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,133
was a big help in thinning
the herd for me.

720
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,807
I suspect you're not done
thinning the herd.

721
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,486
You were always talking about
how much you missed your son.

722
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:35,692
I guess you didn't know
I'm the one who had him killed.

723
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,453
Tell your boy

724
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,248
I said hello.
