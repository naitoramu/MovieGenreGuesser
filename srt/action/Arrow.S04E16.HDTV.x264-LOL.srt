Got an ID
on your not so secret

3
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:05,218
but very crazy admirer.

4
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,074
Carrie Cutter.
She's former SCPD.

5
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,009
Love is a bullet
in the brain.

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,577
My hero!

7
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,511
I'm Cupid, stupid.

8
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,279
And if I don't help you?

9
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,981
I think I made it
abundantly clear

10
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,483
you don't have
a choice.

11
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,951
Are you working
for Damien Darhk?

12
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:21,120
I did what I had to do
to keep you safe.

13
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,355
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

14
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,723
in a court of law.

15
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,191
And who's William?

16
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,459
He's my son.

17
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,228
Oliver, we need
to talk.

18
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,863
I can't do this.

19
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,498
Felicity.

20
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,902
Oh, my God.

Whatever you're
thinking of doing,

29
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,902
you don't have to.

30
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,303
Just let us go.

31
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,404
We won't tell anyone.

32
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,906
No one. Absolutely
not, right?

33
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:19,044
Wonderful.
Agreement...

34
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:22,581
the mortar that holds
together the bricks of love.

35
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,451
So how much
do you love each other?

36
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,488
With everything that I have.

37
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,758
And the missus?

38
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,062
How much does she love
her mister?

39
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,598
More than anything
in the world.

40
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,068
How sweet...

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,670
and pathetic.

42
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,104
Wh--what?

43
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,774
Love is a bullet
to the brain...

44
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,279
or an arrow to the heart.

Please be seated.

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,159
First I'll hear the parties

49
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,594
on the question of bail.

50
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,495
Your honor,
the, uh, defendant wishes

51
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,064
to waive bail so that
the, uh, court can focus

52
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,099
its attention on our
motion to dismiss.

53
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,101
Your honor, the defendant
was apprehended

54
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,970
at the site of
a child abduction.

55
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,605
Because he
was being held captive

56
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:22,174
himself. Your honor,

57
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,609
these documents will confirm

58
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,712
my client's identity as
Kenneth Bender,

59
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:29,014
citizen of Markovia.

60
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,649
Your honor,
this is ridiculous.

61
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,351
The defendant's
name is Damien Darhk

62
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,852
According to whom? You?

63
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,754
Oliver Queen?
The media? Heh.

64
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,855
Your honor,
there's absolutely

65
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,257
no evidence whatsoever

66
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,959
to suggest that my client
is this Damien Darhk,

67
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,095
much less prove beyond
a reasonable doubt

68
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,296
that he committed
these acts

69
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,098
that Damien Darhk is
even accused of.

70
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,633
Your honor, we have
evidence,

71
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,501
and we will present it
at trial.

72
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,669
During which time what?

73
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,437
My client just rots
in jail?

74
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,505
I mean, fortunately,
he's no longer

75
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,640
in Markovia, right?

76
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,041
Because, you know,
in America, we...

77
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,976
We have preliminary
hearings to determine

78
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,511
whether the state can meet
its burden of proof.

79
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,946
Thank you, your honor.

80
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,281
Your honor--

81
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,982
You say you
have evidence, Ms. Lance?

82
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,684
Get ready to present it.

83
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,353
Mr. Darhk or Mr. Bender
or whatever

84
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,454
he's calling himself

85
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,156
is hereby remanded
to the custody

86
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,491
of the Department
of Corrections

87
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,293
to be held until disposition

88
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,395
of defendant's motion
to dismiss.

89
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,674
I worked out
a system to maximize

90
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,309
the efficiency of
the moving process.

91
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,244
The densest,
heaviest boxes are

92
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,912
put into the moving
truck first,

93
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,213
creating a solid
foundation

94
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,848
for the rest of
the boxes

95
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,483
and providing
maximum recovery time

96
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,385
during the most physical
moments of moving.

97
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,121
There's, um...

98
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,856
less chance for injury, too.

99
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,158
I hired a mover.

100
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,592
And I would never want
to step on the toes

101
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,962
of professionals,
but proper distribution

102
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,496
of the mass and density
of the boxes

103
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,065
inside the moving truck
could have

104
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,566
cost-saving effects for
the moving company

105
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,402
in the form of
improved gas mileage.

106
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,371
OK. Great.

107
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:03,575
So you're doing
great with the--

108
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,677
It's just amazing
how much progress

109
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,646
you've made in such
little time.

110
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,947
Paul must be just

111
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,682
a physical therapy
genius.

112
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,184
Yes, like a symphony
of the talents.

113
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,485
You know, with Curtis
and Paul, they're kind of

114
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,087
the perfect team.

115
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,657
You know, marrying tech--

116
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,396
Poor choice of words.
My bad. My specialty.

117
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,697
It's OK.

118
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,632
That's fine. I--
it's, you know,

119
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,202
it's not like, um,

120
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,737
I don't know what
it's like.

121
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,772
We were engaged, and now
we're not together.

122
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,108
That's what it's like.

123
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,944
Did you cancel
the venue? Please?

124
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,980
I'm--yes, I will
get around to

125
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,181
canceling the venue.

126
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,217
Great. Thank you.

127
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,753
And I will uninvite
the guests.

128
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,288
OK.

129
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,492
The movers
will swing by

130
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,493
whenever you want.

131
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,128
Just give them
a call.

132
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,430
I'll see you when
I see you.

133
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,767
So tonight, hmm?

134
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,168
Tonight?

135
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,237
Yeah. Tonight I, uh--

136
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,172
I mean, I guess we
didn't talk about it,

137
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,041
but I was a part of the team
before we were together.

138
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,242
I just assumed...

139
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,011
Oh, tonight. Like,
to--like to--

140
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,513
like every night.
Um...

141
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,848
Of course.

142
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,817
You are a part of
the team

143
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,519
forever and always.

144
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,368
Keep moving.

145
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,643
Stop here.

146
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,946
This is it.

147
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,448
Now that
you've found what

148
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,715
you're looking for,
you don't need us.

149
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,317
So we can just--

150
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,019
No. This isn't the end,
Mr. Queen.

151
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,887
It's the beginning.

152
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,689
Of what?

153
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,058
I grew up in a small
village in Africa.

154
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,427
a country whose named
has changed a dozen times

155
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,396
over the years.

156
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:08,633
One day, bandits came
to my village.

157
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:12,270
They wanted water
and gold and women.

158
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,172
Once they left with them,

159
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:18,510
the only thing remaining
of my village was ash.

160
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:23,315
My home and everyone I loved
was wiped from the earth.

161
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,051
And I was helpless
to stop it.

162
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,020
And I swore I would never
feel helpless again.

163
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,056
So killing all the people
you're holding hostage is

164
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,758
gonna help you not
feel helpless?

165
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,861
How does that make you

166
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,429
any different than
the people

167
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,131
who destroyed your
village?

168
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,367
Oh. It makes me

169
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,402
very different.

170
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,408
Let me show you.

171
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,149
How'd it go
out there tonight?

172
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,117
It was quiet.

173
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,387
Yeah. The City hasn't
had a quiet night

174
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,755
in 4 years.

175
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,023
Yeah. I can't
believe HIVE is silent

176
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,291
just because
Damien Darhk is in jail.

177
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,259
Not for long.

178
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,727
What are you
talking about?

179
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,562
The law's pesky need
for evidence.

180
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,564
The ghost who took
William also took

181
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,966
their cyanide
escape plans.

182
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,468
There's no one to testify
against Darhk.

183
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,936
What about my brother?

184
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,970
You mean the one
that was declared

185
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,239
legally dead
5 years ago? Oh...

186
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,241
should be fun
walking him into court.

187
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,309
Uh, what about us?

188
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,244
Yeah!

189
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,779
Damien kidnapped us
over the holiday.

190
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,447
- We're all witnesses.
- Actually that's good.

191
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,616
The fiancee to the City's
beloved mayoral candidate,

192
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,952
it makes
for a compelling story.

193
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,956
What's wrong?

194
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,592
Oliver and I aren't
engaged anymore, um,

195
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,295
or living together
or together together.

196
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,763
Felicity.

197
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,965
It's fine, which is
universal code

198
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,567
for "I don't want to
talk about it."

199
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,209
The pieces of
Darhk's idol. Yeah.

200
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,643
How you holding up?

201
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,646
Felicity tell you guys?

202
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,415
How are you
holding up?

203
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,317
Is this about
your son?

204
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,086
The fact that I lied
to her about him, yeah.

205
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,921
Yeah, well, you got
a kid, man,

206
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,356
that's a whole lot
to handle.

207
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,692
But don't worry.
She'll come around.

208
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,126
Give her time.

209
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,229
I mean, she wants
to stay on the team.

210
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,397
That's a good sign...

211
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,933
I think.

212
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,535
Hey, Lance
just called.

213
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,237
It's trouble.

214
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,471
HIVE?

215
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,807
Said it was an old friend.

216
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,617
Uh, you guys take five.

217
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,020
Hey. You OK?

218
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,989
You're a little--
little more grim than usual.

219
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,657
You said, "We know
who did this."

220
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,926
Look familiar?

221
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,227
Cupid!

222
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,696
She's supposed to be
in custody at ARGUS.

223
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,166
Yeah? Tell that to them.

224
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,572
What was there?

225
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,173
Left a note for us.

226
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,379
"Love is dead."

227
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:18,848
So is nobody else
gonna say it?

228
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,184
It's Cupid, stupid.

229
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,353
Well, she's changed
up her MO a little:

230
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,954
"Love is dead."

231
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:26,856
Oh! Maybe she's
not so insane after all.

232
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,858
Thought she was locked up
in some ARGUS sub-basement.

233
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,193
Yeah. Not anymore.
I just talked to Lyla.

234
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,195
Turns out Waller was
serious about prisoners

235
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,397
like Cupid working their
way off of Task Force X.

236
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,798
She's out.

237
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,933
Then we start
with her victims.

238
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,167
Did CSU ID them?

239
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:39,435
They're running
prints.

240
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:41,037
Like, seriously?

241
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,806
None of your crime tech guys
read gossip web sites?

242
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:46,409
Uh...heh heh.
Let's assume they don't.

243
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,745
This is Blaine, and
this is Shannon.

244
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,413
OK.

245
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:53,416
Really, guys? Come on.

246
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,585
It's the wedding
of the decade.

247
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:57,120
Why would Cupid
want to ice Star City's

248
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:58,421
most high profile couple?

249
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,489
Well, we figure
that out, we figure out

250
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,424
who her next targets
might be.

251
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,326
How do we know
there's gonna be a next target?

252
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:04,360
I don't think that
Carrie Cutter

253
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,561
has changed
that much.

254
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,863
We got to get to court.

255
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,197
I'm gonna stay here,

256
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:11,234
work up some leads
on Cupid.

257
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,669
It was

258
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:15,271
an Oliver Queen
campaign holiday party.

259
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,773
There was gunfire.

260
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,708
The security that we had
onsite was killed.

261
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,910
And then he walked in.

262
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,612
Let the record
reflect that

263
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:24,213
the witness is pointing
to the defendant.

264
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:27,583
And why did the defendant
walk into Oliver Queen's

265
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,818
campaign office?

266
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,453
He was the leader
of the gunmen.

267
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:31,721
He took myself,
Thea Queen,

268
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,189
and Felicity Smoak
hostage.

269
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,091
And while
you were held hostage--

270
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,459
Damien Darhk--

271
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,194
or whatever
he calls himself--

272
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:41,130
was there calling
the shots

273
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:42,765
the entire time.

274
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,802
Pass the witness.

275
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,007
This, uh, holiday party,

276
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,709
were you, uh...

277
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,210
were you there
as a guest?

278
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:55,645
No, sir.
I work security--

279
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:57,246
personal security
for Mr. Oliver Queen.

280
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:58,948
And I have been for
the past 3-plus years.

281
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,516
Even after Mr. Queen
lost his job

282
00:11:00,518 --> 00:11:02,118
as CEO of
Queen Consolidated?

283
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,886
I mean...

284
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,154
how much does he pay you,
10 cents an hour?

285
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:07,390
Objection.
Relevance?

286
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:09,792
Sustained.
Move faster, Mr. Fitzmartin.

287
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,394
Of course,
your honor. All right.

288
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:14,130
Well, let's, uh,
talk about

289
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,333
your alleged co-captain,
Thea Queen.

290
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,635
Isn't it true
that 5 months ago,

291
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,773
you helped her buy $74,000
worth of cocaine?

292
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,509
And before
you answer that,

293
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:27,810
you should know that I
have a signed affidavit

294
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,412
from Ms. Queen's dealer
right here.

295
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:30,613
Which means
nothing

296
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:31,981
because it is
irrelevant.

297
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,116
Well, it goes
to credibility,

298
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,117
your honor.

299
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,119
Oliver Queen
publicly slandered

300
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:37,754
my client by
accusing him of

301
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,822
ordering a terrorist
drone strike.

302
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,192
Now, if--if Mr. Diggle can
work for Mr. Queen for free

303
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:45,161
to help Ms. Queen buy
illegal drugs, I mean,

304
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,597
is it really that much of
a stretch to believe that

305
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,799
he'd also perjure himself in
support of Mr. Queen's

306
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,334
campaign of character
assassination?

307
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,302
You watched me swear
an oath.

308
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:56,038
And then I saw you break it.

309
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,942
No further questions,
your honor.

310
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:05,515
I don't have
a law degree,

311
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,383
but I don't think
that went well.

312
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:08,684
It could have been worse.

313
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,153
If Fitzmartin kept pulling
on those threads,

314
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:11,487
then everything that we've
done for this city

315
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:12,955
could have been exposed.

316
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,457
It'd be worth it
to put Darhk away.

317
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,958
Except it
wouldn't put him away.

318
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,860
Vigilantes don't
make good witnesses?

319
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,930
No. But they
make excellent inmates.

320
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:22,064
Yeah.

321
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,332
OK. So where does
this leave us?

322
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,168
We can't just let
Darhk walk.

323
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,836
Well, unless
they come up with

324
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,137
a witness who Fitzmartin
can't tear apart,

325
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,839
then that's what's
gonna happen.

326
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:31,641
Then put me on the stand.

327
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:32,875
I don't have
a secret identity,

328
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,910
and I could testify
about Darhk

329
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,511
and his connection to HIVE.

330
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,380
And spend the rest of
your life in jail.

331
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,681
If it's a cell next to
Darhk, it'd be worth it.

332
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,416
No. We'll find
another way.

333
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:41,717
It's Felicity.

334
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,386
Ah.

335
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,554
Put her on speaker.

336
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,788
Felicity, we have
the whole team here.

337
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,023
What's up?

338
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,224
Good news is I got
Cupid's location.

339
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,458
Good.
Where is she?

340
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,060
That's the bad news.

341
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,361
Looks like she's kidnapped
another celebrity couple--

342
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:53,596
Allison Lee
and Robert Joyce.

343
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:54,864
"Allibert."

344
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,732
Can you track the GPS
on their phones?

345
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,234
When I said I had
their location,

346
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,502
how do you think
that I got it?

347
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,571
OK, Felicity,
what's next?

348
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,939
Where are we going?

349
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,776
They're on the move,
headed towards Pennytown.

350
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:07,944
Got it.

351
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:09,445
I'd suit up with
you, but--

352
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:10,947
No. What you're doing
here is more important.

353
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,215
Get Darhk.

354
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:14,016
Get Cupid.

355
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,527
Till death do us part.

356
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:28,231
Don't worry. You won't
have to wait that long.

357
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,438
Wedding crashers.

358
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,139
Hold on tight.

359
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,025
Thea, look out!

360
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,101
She's in the center.

361
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,172
Ugh. I'm OK.

362
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,607
Stay with Speedy.

363
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,010
Let them help you.

364
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,645
I got Cupid.

365
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,173
I'd say enjoy
the afterlife,

366
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:18,708
but we both know

367
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,643
that's just
eternal nothingness.

368
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:29,218
I was in love with
the Arrow,

369
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
but you're not him,

370
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,757
although I do like
the sleeveless.

371
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,462
Got her.

372
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:59,081
Guess you didn't
have her.

373
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:07,184
Really brings
a whole new meaning

374
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:08,651
to crazy ex-girlfriends.

375
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:12,935
And you didn't even get
to enjoy the fun parts.

376
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,503
Sorry.

377
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:16,238
Well, Cutter really fell
for Floyd Lawton last year.

378
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,773
Lucky guy.

379
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,374
She was heartbroken
when he was blown up.

380
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:20,876
No, Thea's right,
though. Cutter is...

381
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:22,144
pathological.

382
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:25,080
I mean, targeting happy couples?
Come on.

383
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,015
Well, it makes sense if you look at it
from her perspective.

384
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,684
Love betrayed her.

385
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,887
And now she wants to
go to war against it.

386
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,257
And--and that's
making sense?

387
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,292
Makes sense to her.

388
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:40,562
OK...she's not just
targeting regular couples.

389
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:41,830
Yeah.

390
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,632
She's targeting
celebrity couples.

391
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:44,666
Probably to bring
attention

392
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:45,767
to her anti-love
crusade.

393
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:46,835
Lance is getting
the word out.

394
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:48,337
He assigned
a protective detail.

395
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,005
I'm gonna run
forensics on this.

396
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,573
We're gonna hit
the streets,

397
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,875
see if we can get
a line on Cutter.

398
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:55,544
OK. You want
to talk about

399
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,145
the other
obvious problem?

400
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:58,647
Yeah, the, uh,
elephant in the room.

401
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,315
Felicity and I are fine.

402
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:01,483
Yeah, well, if you were listening to
her little asides,

403
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:02,818
you would know
that was not true.

404
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,519
John--heh heh--you were
the one who told me

405
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,887
to give her time.

406
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:08,090
OK. Do you want to get
back together with her?

407
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,263
I do.

408
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:10,560
Then tell her that.

409
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:11,860
Even if you fall
on your face, Oliver,

410
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:13,328
she needs to know
where you stand.

411
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,896
She needs to know
that you are willing

412
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:16,164
to say the words.

413
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,699
I am willing to say
the words.

414
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,601
That's good.
So what's stopping you?

415
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,341
Why did you
do that?!

416
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,210
Don't. Let him die.

417
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:30,178
Reiter, you're insane.

418
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,214
The difference
between insanity

419
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:33,949
and belief lies

420
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,451
only in the number
of believers.

421
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:04,112
This is the power of
a single life.

422
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:08,250
Above us, I have dozens
under my control.

423
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:09,851
Prisoners are
gathered topside.

424
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,987
The men are in position.

425
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,955
Tell them to shoot.

426
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:21,963
Hey! Come on! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

427
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:25,600
Hey.

428
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:28,937
So how did the rest of
the day in court go?

429
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:30,806
If it went well,
I wouldn't be here

430
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:32,107
still doing this.

431
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:34,776
Listen, I was thinking,
what about

432
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,311
all the rest of the people
at the holiday party, right?

433
00:18:36,313 --> 00:18:37,746
'Cause they all saw Darhk.

434
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:38,814
Yeah. That's probably
why they're all

435
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,015
too frightened
to testify.

436
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,149
Well, you could
subpoena them.

437
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:43,652
I did that this
afternoon.

438
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:46,588
One lied,
one in jail

439
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,390
because they refused
to testify,

440
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:50,092
and one actually

441
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,127
tried pleading
the fifth.

442
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:53,695
Well, I told you
there's one guy

443
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,163
willing to take the stand.

444
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,998
Dad, I went to my boss,
and I asked him

445
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,035
to give you immunity
from prosecution.

446
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:02,003
He said he'd prefer
to be reelected.

447
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,338
I don't care about immunity.

448
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,840
But I do.

449
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:07,476
Dad, I'm not gonna let
you incriminate yourself.

450
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,844
You--you wouldn't be
doing anything.

451
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:10,679
It'd be me,
and it'd be right.

452
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:12,380
I'm the one that got
into bed with Darhk, right?

453
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:13,882
I made those decisions.

454
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,684
And I should pay the
consequences for 'em, honey.

455
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,606
And, listen, it's the only
way to bring him down.

456
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:27,195
OK. OK.

457
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:29,698
If we do this, you
will also testify

458
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
that you acted under
duress,

459
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,869
that Damien
threatened my life.

460
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:37,706
Yeah. 'Cause that way,
I get to say on record

461
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,574
how much I love
my baby girl.

462
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:41,243
OK.

463
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,914
Felicity Scissorhands.

464
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,149
We struck out

465
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:48,717
trying to find
a line on Cutter.

466
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,318
What's this?

467
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,753
I couldn't exactly fit
the entire sleeve

468
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,122
into the gas chromatograph.

469
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,658
Speak of the devil.

470
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:59,661
The sleeve contains
fibers

471
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,530
from at least 60 different types
of white silk lace.

472
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,832
White lace, like in
wedding dresses?

473
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,367
That would be
ironic.

474
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,868
And also traces
of acid-free polypropylene.

475
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,236
What do they
use that for?

476
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:09,871
Long-term storage
of fabrics.

477
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,439
Well, maybe Cutter's
holed up in a spot

478
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:12,908
where they store
wedding dresses.

479
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,409
Colao Wedding Dress
Services is the only

480
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:16,912
long-term storage
facility in the City

481
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,113
that uses polypropylene.

482
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,514
28th and Hamilton.

483
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:20,816
That's 2 blocks from
where she posed

484
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:22,584
the first 2 victims.

485
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,331
The only movement I'm
tracking in that building is

486
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,399
you guys.

487
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,501
Stay alert.

488
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,053
Got something.

489
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:09,965
She does love her
shrines, doesn't she?

490
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,234
Now we know how
she's picking her targets.

491
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,970
The first 2 couples, they
both recently got married.

492
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,805
Carter abducted
the second couple

493
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,607
after their wedding.

494
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:22,811
Yeah. But Blaine
and Shannon--"Blannon"--

495
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,679
they had a secret wedding
48 hours

496
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:25,914
before they were killed.

497
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,949
Now we have
to figure out

498
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,185
what celebrity couple in the
City's getting married next.

499
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:33,288
I think I found one
we can rule out.

500
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:38,760
So by calling off
the engagement,

501
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:40,295
we took ourselves
out of Cupid's crosshairs.

502
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:41,496
I knew there had to be

503
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:43,632
at least one
silver lining.

504
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,267
Well, she keeps on targeting
high-profile weddings.

505
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,102
So we just got to stake out
whatever the next one is.

506
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:49,170
It's a big risk to run
with an innocent couple.

507
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,805
We're not gonna take
that risk

508
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:52,874
with an innocent couple.

509
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,175
Hey.

510
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,979
We need to get married.

511
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,415
How romantic.

512
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:05,382
But it's--Felicity, it--

513
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:07,023
This is the worst idea
you've ever had.

514
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,523
Actually,
it's not the worst.

515
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:09,523
Et Tu, John?

516
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:10,791
We lost our lead on Cutter,

517
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:12,193
Felicity, and this might
draw her out.

518
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:14,495
Oh, so she can kill me.
Pass. No, thank you.

519
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:17,965
OK. Now, John and I
will have your back.

520
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,201
Oh, I guess it's too bad
I already sent out

521
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:21,702
all those un-invitations.

522
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:22,937
Clearly not if you guys
spent any time

523
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:24,205
on the gossip sites.

524
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:28,175
OK, look, these bloggers
love nothing more

525
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:30,244
than a private
secret wedding.

526
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:32,747
I leak the news saying
you guys wanted

527
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:35,049
to keep it
under radar. Uh...

528
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:37,685
it becomes the top story
on their website.

529
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:39,587
It's catnip for Cupid.

530
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:41,756
OK, look, we have
to do this quickly, OK,

531
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,691
so Cupid doesn't change
her MO

532
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:45,259
and start killing more
innocent couples.

533
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:46,260
Can we do this tomorrow?

534
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:47,361
Tomorrow will work.

535
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:48,929
The venue still has
our deposit.

536
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:50,665
They'll be able
to move up the date.

537
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:53,501
I thought you said you
were gonna cancel that.

538
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,002
I did say that I was
gonna cancel,

539
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:57,438
and I am gonna cancel,
but I haven't canceled yet

540
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,173
because when I picked up...

541
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,243
when I pick up the phone
to do that,

542
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,444
it means it's over.

543
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,379
It is over.

544
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,024
Hey, Taiana,
wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

545
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:20,261
Well, I think we
lost them.

546
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,530
Look, Reiter is not
gonna issue a kill order

547
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:25,599
if he doesn't have
that thing nearby.

548
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,802
You grabbing it,
you saved us.

549
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:29,270
If that's true,

550
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:30,504
then we should destroy
the damn thing.

551
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:31,906
No, wait--

552
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:36,077
Oliver Queen.

553
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,912
We took his radio?

554
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:39,747
I know you're still
down here, Mr. Queen.

555
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:42,817
You should have studied
those maps more closely.

556
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:44,318
The only way out of
these tunnels is

557
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,686
back the way you came,

558
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:48,132
which means going through me.

559
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:50,599
You can either return of
your own accord

560
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:54,804
or you can force me
to come find you.

561
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:57,606
But don't bother trying to
fight your way out of this.

562
00:23:57,608 --> 00:24:01,210
After all, I'm the only one
of us who has men

563
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:03,279
and guns.

564
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:09,618
Well, last August,
Darhk asked me

565
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,087
for the vacation plans

566
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,955
for the chief of
the fire department.

567
00:24:12,957 --> 00:24:14,824
Objection.

568
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,625
Darhk. Bender. Whatever
he wants to call himself.

569
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:18,160
I told him where
Chief Reynolds was staying.

570
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,329
The next day,
the place blows up.

571
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,764
Objection. Conjecture.

572
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:22,898
Something
you're free to challenge

573
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,166
on cross-examination.

574
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:25,367
Continue, Ms. Lance.

575
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:30,005
What else did you do
for the defendant?

576
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,874
He wanted
me to give him

577
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,243
access to the SCPD
computer network.

578
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,679
I did it.

579
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:38,948
He wanted me to give him

580
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,683
the departmental
patrol schedules.

581
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,251
I did that.

582
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:44,053
He wanted me to break in

583
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:46,021
to a federal server farm

584
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:49,225
to install a computer
virus. And I did that.

585
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:52,595
He wanted me to give
him information

586
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:54,230
on the City's leadership.

587
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:57,466
And I...I did that.

588
00:24:57,468 --> 00:24:59,034
And 3 days later,
the City leadership

589
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:00,236
were all dead.

590
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:02,037
You did all of
these things

591
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,506
for the defendant?

592
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:04,907
The defendant and the
organization he works for.

593
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:06,342
He called it HIVE.

594
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:08,544
Objection. Your honor,
it's hearsay.

595
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:10,379
Statement against interest,
your honor.

596
00:25:10,381 --> 00:25:11,747
Overruled.

597
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:17,353
Captain Lance, why would
you do these things?

598
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:20,756
At first, I didn't know
his intentions,

599
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,892
like with the fire chief.

600
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:24,994
But then when I confronted
Darhk about it, he told me

601
00:25:24,996 --> 00:25:27,563
that if I didn't do
everything he asked--

602
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:31,066
everything he told me
to do--

603
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:34,970
he'd have you killed.

604
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:41,811
No more questions,
your honor.

605
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:43,479
Mr. Fitzmartin, your witness.

606
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:48,517
Captain Lance,

607
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,920
have you ever
personally witnessed

608
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:53,756
my client commit
any illegal act?

609
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,758
Well, I'm pretty sure
that threatening

610
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,593
the daughter of a police captain
isn't legal, counselor.

611
00:25:57,595 --> 00:25:59,061
- Objection.
- Overruled.

612
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:01,063
You know, the fact of
the matter is,

613
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:03,332
I've seen your client in
his little hidey-hole

614
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:04,834
with his little men.

615
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:06,101
Ghosts he calls them.

616
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:07,937
And I've heard him say
repeatedly

617
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:09,872
how he wants to destroy
this city

618
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,974
and that if I didn't
help him do it,

619
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:14,243
then he'd kill my
daughter.

620
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:17,646
By saying all these
things,

621
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:20,349
I'm setting a match
to my career

622
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,952
and maybe my life.

623
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:24,787
So why would I be doing
that if everything I'm

624
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,622
saying isn't true?

625
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:42,938
In position.

626
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,573
In position.

627
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:47,176
There's no psychopaths here
other than paparazzi.

628
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,846
Tapped into
security cameras. All clear.

629
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:06,195
Everything OK?

630
00:27:06,197 --> 00:27:09,164
Yes. Yeah.

631
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:12,568
You look perfect.

632
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:16,639
I'd like to assure you,
I won't breathe a word

633
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:18,173
of what goes on here
to the press.

634
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,042
Just thrilled to be part
of your day.

635
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:21,877
- Thank you.
- Can we get this over with?

636
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:25,381
Can't wait to be
married to this guy.

637
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:27,616
In that case,

638
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:28,918
I know you've written
your own vows.

639
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,419
Felicity...

640
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,054
The vows.

641
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:33,088
Yeah.

642
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,592
OK, um...

643
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:41,830
Oliver, you have many
qualities...

644
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,833
many astonishing
qualities.

645
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:46,735
And I, for one,
cannot wait to move on

646
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:49,004
to the next chapter.

647
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:52,141
All right.
Uh, Oliver?

648
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:54,610
Felicity...

649
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:59,648
before I met you,
I had a plan.

650
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,984
I had a way that I was
gonna be.

651
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:07,222
But then you walked
into my life.

652
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:12,227
Or, I--I...showed up
at your cubicle and...

653
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:16,031
you changed everything.

654
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:20,102
I was in darkness.

655
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:24,873
But with your kindness,

656
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,676
your generosity,
your compassion,

657
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:31,847
your intelligence,
your wit, and your trust...

658
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:36,051
you brought me into
the light.

659
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:40,723
You let me know...

660
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:42,658
that I deserved it.

661
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:47,563
You were that light.

662
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:52,668
And I don't know if I still
deserve that trust...

663
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:55,871
if I deserve you.

664
00:28:57,808 --> 00:28:59,608
I probably don't.

665
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:05,280
But whatever has happened,
whatever will happen,

666
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:08,417
the way that you
make me feel is

667
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,486
the best part of my life.

668
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:15,758
You can ask me to say
that I don't love you...

669
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,766
that I will never lie
to you again.

670
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:27,603
You are my always.

671
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:31,507
And I just want the chance
to be yours.

672
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,642
Oliver.

673
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:36,979
Hello, lovers.

674
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:38,447
Run.

675
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:42,217
We have eyes on?

676
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:43,485
Copy that. I'm here.

677
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:45,320
Yeah, we got that.
Hold tight.

678
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:47,256
Your little speech,

679
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:48,957
it was only off
by a little.

680
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,726
You see, she isn't
the best thing

681
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:51,960
in your life.

682
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,363
Because that means
you love her.

683
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:57,132
And love means you're soft.

684
00:29:57,134 --> 00:30:00,702
And soft
means death.

685
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,037
Here. Let me show you.

686
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:10,946
Oh. Sorry. I didn't
check your gift registry.

687
00:30:13,784 --> 00:30:17,186
Was an explosion that
would bring down

688
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:19,354
this whole building
on your list?

689
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:33,243
Your engagement,
that horrible shooting,

690
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,913
your miracle recovery--

691
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:38,148
it was all just
a fairy tale.

692
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,484
Camelot in Star City.

693
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:41,785
Thank you.

694
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:43,720
But once Camelot dies,

695
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:45,889
everyone will know
my truth--

696
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:50,861
that love is a bullet
to the brain.

697
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:53,230
No.
No, it's not.

698
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,038
Kevlar under
the tux.

699
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,440
My bodyguard
insisted.

700
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:06,643
What was his plan
for C4?

701
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:08,245
That's a damn good question.

702
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:10,147
You know, you don't
have to do this.

703
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:11,281
I do.

704
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:18,655
The 2 words that start
every marriage: "I do."

705
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:21,258
True love.
People need to see.

706
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,494
They need to know
what a joke that is.

707
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:24,895
It's not.

708
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:29,666
I have loved
2 men in my life

709
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:31,835
with all my soul.

710
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:34,838
They're both dead now.

711
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:40,344
No matter what, love
always ends in death.

712
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:42,513
That's why it's in
the vows.

713
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:44,948
I'm just cutting out
the middleman.

714
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:50,521
Love is death.

715
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:52,256
It's not.

716
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,258
You saw all those
people outside, right?

717
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:58,595
They're out there
because love is real,

718
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:04,001
because
love is life itself.

719
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:05,969
And if I die tonight...

720
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:10,874
it'll be OK

721
00:32:10,876 --> 00:32:13,310
because I was one
of those people

722
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,279
lucky enough to have
experienced it.

723
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:18,148
From the moment he
walked into my life,

724
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,883
everything changed.

725
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:22,352
I became a person that
I didn't even know

726
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:24,187
I was capable of
becoming.

727
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:27,190
I became the very best
version of myself.

728
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:31,028
That would never
have been possible

729
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,696
without our love.

730
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:36,366
Our love gives my life
meaning.

731
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:38,402
It gives
my life purpose.

732
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:41,204
And it...

733
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:43,006
brings us more joy

734
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,409
than you can ever take
away from us.

735
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:49,746
And it's worth
living for.

736
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:52,349
All of it.

737
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:55,552
You really know how
to make a girl

738
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:57,354
believe in love again.

739
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:31,822
You all right?

740
00:33:31,824 --> 00:33:33,557
Yeah.

741
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:51,648
Thanks for giving
the rest of us hope.

742
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:57,720
You OK?

743
00:33:57,722 --> 00:33:59,155
Uh, yeah.

744
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:04,394
About what you said
in there to Cutter,

745
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:07,630
maybe we could meet up
and talk about it tonight

746
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:09,098
or...

747
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,034
No, not tonight.

748
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:12,535
I think we're both
exhausted

749
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:15,405
from whatever
that was.

750
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:16,906
Tomorrow.

751
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:20,210
Hey, guys, Laurel
just texted.

752
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:22,245
I guess Judge Sakow
is holding court late.

753
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,413
And she's making
her decision.

754
00:34:23,415 --> 00:34:25,448
Well, I should
probably change.

755
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,616
This outfit is

756
00:34:26,618 --> 00:34:28,585
a bit of
a focus puller.

757
00:34:31,223 --> 00:34:33,122
Not for nothing, Oliver,
but I heard what, uh,

758
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:34,757
Felicity said in there.

759
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:36,526
Nobody likes an "I told
you so," John.

760
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:39,929
I'm just saying,
she needs some time.

761
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:54,444
Watch it. It could
be a trap.

762
00:34:57,082 --> 00:35:00,016
They just left it behind.
Why would they do that?

763
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,057
Drop the weapon.

764
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:13,129
Maybe you should
radio Reiter.

765
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:14,297
Why?

766
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,132
Now we have guns, too.

767
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:21,437
The standard of proof for
a preliminary hearing is

768
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:23,940
much less severe than one
for a trial.

769
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:25,842
Even so, the evidence
against the defendant

770
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:27,443
is exceedingly thin.

771
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:30,947
There is no forensic
or circumstantial evidence

772
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:33,750
that points
to the defendant's guilt.

773
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:38,655
But I found Quentin Lance's
testimony to be

774
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:40,323
particularly compelling.

775
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:42,358
His credibility is bolstered
by his status

776
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,427
as a police captain.

777
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:46,195
But the fact that he was
willing to incriminate

778
00:35:46,197 --> 00:35:49,565
himself to see justice done
makes his testimony

779
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,134
especially believable.

780
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:54,337
On the strength of it,
I am denying

781
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,372
the defense's motion
to dismiss

782
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:58,508
and bounding the defendant
over for trial.

783
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,677
Mr. Darhk will be held
without bail

784
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,578
or possibility of release.

785
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,733
All right.
Next step, convicting

786
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:25,568
this son of a bitch.

787
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,103
Next step. Right.

788
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,638
Are we OK?

789
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,340
I wasn't exactly pulling
punches on the stand.

790
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:32,175
No, I'm glad you did.
Because of that,

791
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:33,843
Darhk's defense is
blown to shreds.

792
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:35,712
He's gonna spend
the rest of his life behind bars.

793
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,047
Hey, Quentin, you have
a minute?

794
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:39,549
Yeah.

795
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:41,584
Lieutenant Pike, if I
could just talk to you before--

796
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:42,885
It's all right, sweetheart.

797
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:44,787
We both know
this was coming. Frank?

798
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:46,389
You're being suspended

799
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:48,191
pending an IAB
investigation.

800
00:36:48,193 --> 00:36:49,759
I'm gonna need your badge
and your weapon.

801
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:51,527
Yeah.

802
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55,865
Sorry about
this, Quentin.

803
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,401
I'm sure your union rep
will make it clear

804
00:36:58,403 --> 00:37:00,336
to IAB that you were
acting under duress.

805
00:37:00,338 --> 00:37:03,239
Yeah, I'm good either way,
Frank. Truly.

806
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:09,579
It's a temporary
setback.

807
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:11,681
I'll represent you
in front of IAB.

808
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:14,250
You just focus on
nailing Darhk to a cross,

809
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,318
all right?

810
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,887
I'm proud of you, baby.

811
00:37:20,925 --> 00:37:22,859
We have the results
of the high-profile

812
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:25,261
preliminary hearing against
purported Markovia...

813
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,262
Hi.

814
00:37:26,264 --> 00:37:27,797
- Kenneth Bender...
- Hi.

815
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:29,432
also known
as Damien Darhk.

816
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:30,600
Darhk had previously
been implicated...

817
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:31,834
I thought you'd be
asleep by now.

818
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:34,303
Oh, I can't sleep.

819
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:36,506
What are you doing here?

820
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:38,808
I just came to pick up a few
things. You know.

821
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,810
In other news,
Star City's favorite couple,

822
00:37:40,812 --> 00:37:42,445
Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak,
had an unexpected crasher...

823
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:44,080
That's not
exactly how I pictured

824
00:37:44,082 --> 00:37:45,281
our wedding day.

825
00:37:45,283 --> 00:37:46,649
I don't know.
Being kidnapped by

826
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:48,051
psychotic criminals
has sort of been

827
00:37:48,053 --> 00:37:49,819
the theme of our
relationship.

828
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:51,054
...at
the private ceremony at

829
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:52,622
the Hochman Hotel.
Armed with explo...

830
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:00,797
Um, I want you
to know that...

831
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:05,902
what I said today during
the ceremony...

832
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:09,672
well, I meant every
single word of it.

833
00:38:09,674 --> 00:38:11,808
I love you...

834
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:19,682
with everything
in me.

835
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:22,485
But what I said
doesn't apply to us.

836
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:25,822
I can't be with you.
I can't marry you.

837
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:29,192
Yes, you can.

838
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:32,662
Yes, you can because
that's what both of us want.

839
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:35,331
You know, things
can be different.

840
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,999
I could be different.

841
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:42,705
And I am promising you,
I'm swearing to you,

842
00:38:42,707 --> 00:38:45,641
there will be no more lies.

843
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,813
You know, no matter
how much you love me,

844
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:52,381
there's always gonna be
a part of you

845
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:53,850
that defaults to the man

846
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:56,552
who was on the island
alone...

847
00:38:57,622 --> 00:39:01,491
who came back to
save the city alone.

848
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,694
And sooner than we both
think, you're going to

849
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:06,896
be stuck
in a situation

850
00:39:06,898 --> 00:39:09,132
where you have to
make a decision that

851
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:12,101
requires you to hide
things from me again.

852
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:13,703
See, you can't know that.

853
00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:17,173
I do know that,
and you know that.

854
00:39:17,175 --> 00:39:18,674
That's this life.

855
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:23,479
I'm sorry.

856
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:25,848
You know, 5 months ago,
I convinced you

857
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,750
that we could have
it all,

858
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:30,119
we could come here
to this job

859
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:31,354
and have each other.

860
00:39:31,356 --> 00:39:32,889
I was wrong.

861
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,725
And then I thought
that we could just

862
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:36,893
go back to the way
things were

863
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:38,561
before we left
for Ivy Town.

864
00:39:38,563 --> 00:39:41,464
But, God, that was
as crazy as Cupid is.

865
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:46,802
So what does that mean?

866
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,842
It means that it is,
um, too hard

867
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:54,377
to be here with you
every night

868
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:55,678
and not be with you.

869
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,180
That's not fair
to either of us.

870
00:39:57,182 --> 00:39:59,182
You told me how you
worked some tech magic

871
00:39:59,184 --> 00:40:01,150
to return all the money
that Adam Hunt swindled

872
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:02,718
out of people. You...

873
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,886
you don't need me.

874
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:05,721
You'll be fine.

875
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:11,928
You don't give up.

876
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,829
You know, that's what
makes you a hero.

877
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:18,734
But there's
no fixing this.

878
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:22,572
We have to let
each other go.

879
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:31,447
I want you to keep
it for good this time,

880
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:32,949
please.

881
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,455
I don't want
to let you go.

882
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:43,793
I don't want to let
you go.

883
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:47,163
But I'm already
gone.

885
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:18,446
Greg!
Move your head.
