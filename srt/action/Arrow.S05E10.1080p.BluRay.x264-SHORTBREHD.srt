1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,254
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,549
<i>Four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne.</i>

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,967
You told me that Claybourne
didn't have any kids.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,348
There's no record of the kid's name.
He'd be about 30 today.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,646
Just old enough to put on
a hood and a mask.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,441
Old enough to want revenge on the man
who murdered his father.

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,103
Evelyn? Why?

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,864
You're a fraud.
This city needs to be saved from you.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,070
<i>He'!-</i>

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,571
<i>Johnny, I need you
to come to the Safe House.</i>

11
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,953
<i>- Something's wrong with J.J.
- Lyla?</i>

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,742
Did you find Billy?

13
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,121
<i>I didn't know it was Billy,
I couldn't have known.</i>

14
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,623
Hi, Ollie.

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,755
I saw you die.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:51,560
I was saved. I saw this white light and...

17
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,477
It's... It's just like they say.

18
00:00:55,806 --> 00:01:00,437
This angel, she reached out to me,
but she wasn't an angel.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,068
She was my sister.

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,403
What?

21
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,867
Sara, she had me teleported
to the <i>Waverider.</i>

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,996
They have this technology
that fixed the embolism.

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,997
I was there.

24
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,046
Everyone was there.

25
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,833
Nobody saw a white light,
and you didn't go anywhere.

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,676
That's because she hadn't done it yet.

27
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,550
Ollie...

28
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,257
Ollie, I asked her.

29
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,434
I asked her to bring me to your present.

30
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,726
She gave me the same gift that I gave her.

31
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,986
She gave me a second chance.

32
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,689
It's a miracle.

33
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,740
Laurel?

34
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,533
Hi, Felicity.

35
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,211
Laurel? Oh, my God!

36
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,206
on, my God!

37
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,208
It's a miracle.

38
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,048
Oliver said the exact same thing.

39
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,059
I thought Sara and the Legends
were against changing history.

40
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,059
Sara said that they figured out a way
to bring me back without causing a, uh...

41
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,686
An Aberration?

42
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,237
Yes, that.

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,197
Are you okay?

44
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,900
Fine.

45
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,237
Yeah, I just wished the Legends
could bring back everybody we wanted.

46
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,741
What happened? What did I miss?

47
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,455
We'll talk about it later.

48
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,456
The important thing is
that you're back from the past.

49
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,791
Which they brought you back
from months later,

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,717
and they just dropped you here.

51
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,381
So weird.

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,889
Time travel, am I right? Wow.

53
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,551
Do you guys want coffee?

54
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,137
I am gonna get a decaf,
probably, 'cause...

55
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,856
It's nice to see some things
haven't changed.

56
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,355
Ugh. I have to call my dad.

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,858
He's gonna kill me for coming here first.

58
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,905
Laurel, after you...

59
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,413
Your dad left with Donna
and it didn't go well.

60
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,616
- He's drinking again.
- He's in rehab.

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,375
But, he's getting better.
He's getting the help that he needs.

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,963
Wow. Nine months.

63
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,087
I guess I have a lot of catching up to do.

64
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,297
Which is why I'm going to
tell everyone to come to the party.

65
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,550
What party?

66
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,472
The party that we're gonna throw
for Laurel tomorrow night.

67
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,803
That sounds great.

68
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,561
I mean, I would love to see everyone.
Thea and John...

69
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,354
Oh, my... John! Oh...

70
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,140
I came here to tell you
and I totally forgot.

71
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,685
What's going on with John?

72
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,612
I can't believe she's back.

73
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,986
I walked into the bunker,
and she was just there.

74
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,655
Like nothing had happened.
Like it was some kind of gift.

75
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,781
How much does she know
about what's happened?

76
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,454
We're easing her in.

77
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,081
There's a lot to process. The recruits...

78
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,374
Prometheus.

79
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,001
The fact that you killed his dad.

80
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,386
Felicity and Lyla are working on
finding his mother.

81
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,091
What happened with the dude
who trained the two of you?

82
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,184
Well, she doesn't stay
in one spot for very long.

83
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,349
But, I'm working on finding her.

84
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,520
In the meantime, we need to work
on a way of getting you out of here.

85
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,352
Yeah, well, we did that, remember?

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,687
And here I am, right back on the inside.

87
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,073
- Well, John...
- No, man. No more running.

88
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,285
It's time I faced this head on,
and fight these trumped-up charges.

89
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,869
That's an improvement from last time.

90
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,158
Roger that.

91
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,582
I'm gonna show Walker that he picked
the wrong soldier to screw with.

92
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,201
We need to have some kind of plan.

93
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,377
I'm gonna need one hell of a lawyer.

94
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,038
I might know a guy.

95
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,261
My captains warned me
that you would be a risk.

96
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,433
An American Bratva?

97
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,396
But I thought that you could be useful.

98
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,232
I did what you asked me to do.

99
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,572
I tried to blow up Kovar's casino.

100
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,617
All that you were interested in
was killing Konstantin Kovar.

101
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,619
But not for the Bratva.

102
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,580
For yourself. For a woman.

103
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,419
Kovar told me everything.

104
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,456
Kovar is a government agent.

105
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,092
And the deal that you made with him
betrays the Bratva.

106
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,049
<i>Your vendetta betrays the Bratva.</i>

107
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,717
My deal with Kovar
benefits our brotherhood.

108
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,763
And, in any case, I am Pakhan.

109
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,182
My decisions are the law.

110
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,814
And I will get obedience from you,

111
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,601
even if I have to beat it into you.

112
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,075
ls this why you joined Bratva?

113
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,658
To get to Kovar?

114
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,957
Because you had some promise to her?

115
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,832
Hmm?

116
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,839
You don't have to drop everything
and fly home, Thea.

117
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,557
I'll still be here
when the conference is over.

118
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,810
And the way Oliver describes it,

119
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,105
you're the one that's doing all the
heavy lifting at the mayor's office.

120
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,151
I guess spontaneous resurrection
is as good as any reason for a party.

121
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,393
But...

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,781
But we haven't even buried
Detective Malone yet.

123
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,241
It feels weird to be celebrating?

124
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,194
It doesn't feel weird to you?

125
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,075
Yes, weird, yeah.

126
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,250
Weirder. I guess.

127
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,794
After the past four years it's just
hard for me to accept good news.

128
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,844
It's weird, man. She was dead.
Now she's not.

129
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,471
Well, that's time travel for you.

130
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,512
Well, I don't mean Laurel being back
is what's weird.

131
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,643
It's how you all reacted to it.
Like it's happened before.

132
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,101
It's happened before?

133
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,852
The Lance sisters have a habit
of coming back to life.

134
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,817
Wait, what?

135
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,871
Yo, Curtis. Come back inside.
We're gonna make a toast.

136
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,410
It doesn't feel right
to be gathered around like this.

137
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,707
Detective Malone is dead.
Evelyn betrayed us.

138
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,043
And Prometheus is still out there.

139
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:44,010
We should be trying to find him.
Making him pay for everything.

140
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,066
A little over a year ago,
I stood right here,

141
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,406
and I remarked that I wished
it wasn't just the dark times

142
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,820
that brought us together.

143
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,036
<i>With all of the loss
that we have suffered,</i>

144
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,200
I think it's important,
that we embrace the miracles, too.

145
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,829
And that we remember
they are still possible.

146
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,674
Welcome home, Laurel.

147
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,543
Cheers.

148
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,934
Hey.

149
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,933
"Sorry?
"God!

150
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,310
I wasn't expecting anyone here. It's late.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,313
I don't sleep much. Or at all.

152
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,698
Side-effect of wearing haunted rags,
I guess.

153
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,284
So, I figured I'd train. What's that?

154
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,947
- It's nothing.
- It's my Qmail.

155
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,119
You know, my Face-Chat, Snapbook stuff.

156
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,451
All the kids are doing these
new, crazy social media things...

157
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,913
- You're running a DNA analysis.
- Yeah, lam. On Laurel's glass.

158
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,965
That... What, you took from the party?

159
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,298
Oh, if by "party" you mean
my brilliant ruse to collect her DNA,

160
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,929
then, yes, you are correct.

161
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,135
- Wow.
- Yeah.

162
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,717
You know, there's looking a gift horse
in the mouth and then there's...

163
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,976
Being driven by paranoid delusions

164
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,645
to run comparisons on genetic base pairs?

165
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,146
- Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.
- Yeah?

166
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,186
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,647
- Well?
- DNA matches.

168
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,480
- Okay, so, we can relax, Shapeshifter.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,815
Ooh, what about an evil twin?

170
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,486
Oh. No.

171
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,699
Okay, I was joking.

172
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,036
No. No, no, no, no, no.
She actually has an evil twin.

173
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,993
- Seriously?
- Yeah. She's locked up in S.T.A.R. Labs.

174
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,581
I'll explain later.
Right now we have to call Cisco...

175
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,676
Finally!
It's about time someone figured it out.

176
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,852
You know, I am so sick and tired
of playing this weak, vulnerable Laurel.

177
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,225
She's such a pill. It's pathetic.

178
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,236
You know, the one problem with my ability

179
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,073
is that I can never hear
my poor little victims scream.

180
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,371
Laurel!

181
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,304
Hey, are you hurt?

182
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,930
I'm gonna be okay. But...

183
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,055
That's not our Laurel.

184
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,239
So, that Laurel's from
an alternate reality?

185
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,904
Technically, she's from
a parallel universe.

186
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,243
We're on Earth-1.

187
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,696
The lookalike Laurel
is from another Earth, Earth-2.

188
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,248
Over there, we all have doppelganger
versions of ourselves

189
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,159
who could be very similar
or incredibly different

190
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,744
based on an infinite amount of variables.

191
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,704
I'd love to see what I'm like
on Earth-2.

192
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,919
Oh, God! What if I'm straight?

193
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,167
Okay. One thing I don't get...

194
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,545
Well, you know,
there's a list of things I don't get,

195
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,471
but the top is, this fake Laurel
seemed to know, like, everything.

196
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,424
- How's that possible?
- Prometheus.

197
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,723
Cisco just sent this over.
It is from three days ago.

198
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,430
<i>Nobody knew
because no alarms were tripped.</i>

199
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,060
It's like he's a dybbuk.

200
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,357
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

201
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,310
- One question.
- Just one?

202
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,442
Prometheus breaks into S.T.A.R. Labs,
gets not-Laurel,

203
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,865
Henry-Higgins her into coming off
as real-Laurel.

204
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,485
That's a lot of hoops.
Why not just kill you?

205
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,698
He told me he doesn't want to.

206
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,955
He's proving to me
that I will destroy myself

207
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,327
and everyone close to me.

208
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,325
Well, he's gonna be disappointed,

209
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,911
because we are gonna put Black Siren
back in her cage.

210
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,296
"Black Siren"?

211
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,923
Every meta gets a nickname.

212
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,124
Let's hit the streets.

213
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,510
She is not leaving the city
until this is over.

214
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,794
What are you gonna do?

215
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,802
John needs my help as mayor.
I will be on my cell.

216
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,812
Let's see if I understand.

217
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,605
You carried this girl with you

218
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,275
through all of your trials
and tribulations on some island.

219
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,152
- Lian Yu
- Yes.

220
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,193
And yet, when you get off this island,

221
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,115
you do not return home.

222
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,822
No.

223
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:19,657
Instead, you come to a country
where you know just one person,

224
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,831
you join my organization,
pass all of our tests,

225
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:29,508
and all of this so you can avenge
the death of a different woman?

226
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,544
Woman in that photo's name is Laurel.

227
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,758
And I didn't return home

228
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,350
because after everything
I've been through,

229
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,270
everything I've done,

230
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,855
she wouldn't recognize me.

231
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,145
Now I see.

232
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,689
You think that you've been made
into a monster?

233
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,990
Better a monster than a sell-out.

234
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,988
How much did Kovar pay you
to betray your brothers?

235
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,721
Your failure is unacceptable.

236
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,093
You should have let me kill them

237
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,471
instead of some stupid role-playing idea.

238
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,192
It is not your place
to question my agenda.

239
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:34,068
Your freedom, your life is contingent
on following my orders.

240
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,987
Do you understand?

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,493
Hey, thanks for coming in.

242
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,621
No problem.
I wanted to talk with you as well.

243
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,748
Okay. Uh, the file that I sent you...

244
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,457
John Diggle is my former bodyguard.
And current friend.

245
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,170
And facing a court-martial
for espionage, murder,

246
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,794
escaping a federal prison,
and attempted theft of a WMD.

247
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,091
He's innocent.

248
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,592
So why did he escape a federal prison?

249
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,423
Because he's innocent.

250
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,266
The man who framed him
is a three-star General.

251
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,097
John did not think that he would
get a fair trial in the court system.

252
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,931
Which is where you come in.

253
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,481
Oliver, I'm a city prosecutor,
not a military defense attorney.

254
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,106
That's why I thought of you.

255
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,613
John needs someone outside
of the military infrastructure.

256
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,150
This is the only way
for justice to get done.

257
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,118
- He doesn't even know me.
- John Diggle is a good man.

258
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,531
He's better than the both of us
put together.

259
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,286
Getting the Judge Advocates

260
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,793
to even authorize me
to pro hac in would be a miracle.

261
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,495
Sounds like a "yes."

262
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,164
Eh, more like a, God, help me.
And your friend.

263
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,299
Hey, I will owe you one.

264
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,797
This is worth more than one.

265
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:43,304
Um, actually, hey... As if we don't have
enough on our plate,

266
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,389
have you heard about the circumstances

267
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,848
surrounding the death of Detective Malone?

268
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,555
No.

269
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,517
He was wearing Prometheus' outfit
when he was killed.

270
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,729
His mouth was taped shut,
a sword taped into his hand.

271
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,738
There was a wireless speaker
found on the scene.

272
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,196
What are you saying?

273
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,327
That it looks like Malone was set up.

274
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,702
That it looks like the Green Arrow
was manipulated into killing him.

275
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,284
By Prometheus.

276
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,915
I made sure the cops who caught the scene
won't say anything,

277
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,251
and I'm handling the coroner.
I just wanted to let you know.

278
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,379
Yeah, that you're gonna cover this up?

279
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,834
If the city finds out

280
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,171
that a member of the Anti-Crime Unit
was Prometheus,

281
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,471
there's gonna be panic.

282
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,516
If the Green Arrow killed a member
of the Anti-Crime Unit,

283
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,185
there's gonna be panic.

284
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,270
- Either way.
- Gotta keep this quiet.

285
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,773
It's the only way to see justice done.

286
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,738
This is Mayor Queen.

287
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,573
Oliver, it's me. Laurel.

288
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,204
Don't you say her name.

289
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,996
I'm sorry. What I did was unforgivable.

290
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,497
But, but he made me do it. Prometheus.

291
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,171
What do you mean, he made you?

292
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,750
He threatened to kill me.
You have to help me. Please.

293
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,710
Can you meet?

294
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,382
Where?

295
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,881
The Black Canary statue.
I'll be there soon.

296
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,303
Wait...

297
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,180
<i>Any sign of Black Siren?</i>

298
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,817
Not yet. But everyone's
gonna stand down and do not engage...

299
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,022
Yeah, we get it.

300
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,357
Yeah, well, I say take her down.

301
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,562
Overwatch.

302
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,865
You heard the boss.
This is an eyes-only operation for you.

303
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,157
I have eyes on.

304
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,073
Boys, I just put you
on a separate channel.

305
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,237
Uh, why?

306
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,498
So, if Black Siren looks like
she's about to double-cross,

307
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,748
and trust me, she will,

308
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,330
you have it on my authority
to light her up.

309
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,120
Thank you for meeting me.

310
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,749
You don't believe me.
Prometheus threatened to kill me.

311
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,210
You're a very convincing liar.

312
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,670
I deserve that.

313
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,467
According to S.T.A.R. Labs,

314
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,429
you'd help Prometheus
even if he wasn't threatening anyone.

315
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,093
That's what they think.

316
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,302
What do you think?

317
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,522
I can help you track him.

318
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,770
Take her out.

319
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,340
I told you not to engage.

320
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,971
We know, it's just...

321
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,886
She, um, spooked us.

322
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,717
You guys are terrible liars.

323
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,973
I told them to move on her.

324
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,682
Since when are they taking orders
from you?

325
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,317
I don't know. But I kind of like it.

326
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,862
- She had something in her hand.
- She had her phone in her hand.

327
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,943
Well, it didn't look like her phone,

328
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,444
and I don't trust her,
so I told them to move.

329
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,901
I had the situation under control.

330
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,786
She told me that
Prometheus forced her to do this.

331
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,079
Now whether or not that is true,

332
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,782
she was going to give us
valuable intel on him.

333
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,367
She's playing you, Oliver.

334
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,077
I understand that you're
suspicious of her.

335
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,754
And I know this Laurel
is from another Earth,

336
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,424
that this is not our Laurel.
But we don't know why.

337
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,418
We don't.

338
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,853
I told you. Blinders.

339
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,478
<i>HEY. Wu good'?</i>

340
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,110
Why wouldn't <i>I</i> be?

341
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,446
I just got my ass kicked
for the bazillionth time.

342
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,697
So, basically, I'm trading a cell
in Central City

343
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,199
for a cell in Starling City.

344
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,705
Actually, on this Earth,
we call it "Star City."

345
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,213
I'm sorry about the cell.

346
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,799
I told you
that Prometheus was going to kill me.

347
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,960
And that is why I did what I did.

348
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,677
Your history on Earth-2
would suggest you had other reasons.

349
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,054
- You don't trust me?
- Can you blame me?

350
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,138
No. Because on my world,
you've been dead for 10 years now.

351
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,815
<i>I moved to Central City for</i> a <i>fresh start.</i>

352
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,934
That's where this happened.

353
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,649
And from then,
it was just one bad choice after another.

354
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,400
And I guess
once you let the darkness inside,

355
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,826
it never comes out.

356
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,538
And now I am trapped
in a parallel dimension,

357
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,911
telling my sob story

358
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,244
to the doppelganger of the man that...
That I loved.

359
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,871
So stop running.

360
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,924
Face the darkness.

361
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,926
How does that work?

362
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,756
First, you need to tell me
everything that you know about Prometheus.

363
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,256
<i>Everything.</i>

364
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,346
And then we keep you safe.

365
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,016
And you're willing to do that, why?

366
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,356
Why, because I look like someone
you used to know?

367
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,646
Someone once told me that a circumstance

368
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,196
could make something poison or nectar.

369
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,280
What they meant was
that we get to choose what we are.

370
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,956
<i>We get to choose who we are.</i>

371
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,742
So tell me...

372
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,455
Who are you?

373
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,586
Hey, yo, hold up!

374
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,925
I'll walk with you. Hopping the L-line.

375
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,132
- You taking the subway?
- No, I'm just gonna walk.

376
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,842
BY Yourself?

377
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,561
You do have a tendency
to get your ass kicked.

378
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,139
Did you just come all the way
out here just to insult me?

379
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,391
I'm just going home,
but that was merely a product of...

380
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,813
I'll see you tomorrow, Rene.

381
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,815
Damn, you soft!

382
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,646
I thought you had some wit, man.

383
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,232
What, the Black Siren kicked that
out of you, too?

384
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,737
Not now, man. Not now.

385
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,198
What, did I hurt your feelings?

386
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,446
Just let me be, man.

387
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,415
What's your damage, hoss?

388
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,743
I mean, ever since the party,
you've been off.

389
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,995
You're supposed
to be the happy one, remember?

390
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,168
Like what? Like this?

391
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,833
What the hell's gotten into you?

392
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,218
I've been stabbed, shot at, put in a coma,

393
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,219
had magic powers used on me,

394
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,422
superpowers used against me, and for what?

395
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,550
What difference does it make?

396
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,851
All it's done is cost me my blood,
my sweat...

397
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,358
And my Paul.

398
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,686
It cost me Paul.

399
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,861
That's your husband, right?

400
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,285
Was. He left me.

401
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,700
'Cause of you being Mr. Terrific?

402
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,291
Because of me trying.

403
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,086
But I'm never gonna make it,
because I don't have what it takes.

404
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,213
So now I don't have anything.

405
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,850
Hey, keep your wrist straight.
Just so you don't jam it.

406
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,523
Mmm.

407
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,444
- I spoke to Laurel.
- When did she become Laurel?

408
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,499
She's not Laurel. Not Laurel Laurel.
She's not our Laurel, okay? Not...

409
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:09,208
Okay, Felicity, I can't pretend
to understand parallel worlds.

410
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,085
But if I'm gonna believe in them,

411
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,798
and I kind of have to now,
then I need to believe

412
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,754
that differences
are caused by circumstances.

413
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,222
So why can't we change
this Laurel's circumstances?

414
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,517
You think that you can save her.

415
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,149
- After she's thrown in with Prometheus...
- Under duress.

416
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,269
I just...

417
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,323
I think I can reach her.

418
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,276
When did you find the time
to get a PhD in psychology?

419
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,819
I'm a quick study.

420
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,958
My name's Adrian Chase,
Star City District Attorney.

421
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:52,122
John Diggle. Convict.
You here to add to my charges?

422
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,253
Not exactly. I'm representing you.

423
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:00,805
Your friend Oliver's persuasive.
Plus, he's my boss.

424
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,051
General Walker,
the guy who wants you out of the picture,

425
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,477
- you know who his boss is?
- The President.

426
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,975
So you can imagine how difficult
this is about to be.

427
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,655
Mr. Chase, MP officers are here to remand
the prisoner into their custody.

428
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,199
Wait, I thought
I was supposed to stay here for now.

429
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,572
You're under their jurisdiction.
The trial...

430
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,076
The trial? Man, there won't be a trial.

431
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,327
As soon as I'm out of here,

432
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,412
Walker will concoct some reason
to put a bullet in my head.

433
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,251
Sergeant Diggle.

434
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,006
Good to see you again.

435
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,211
Have Sergeant Diggle cleared out of here
and ready for transport ASAP.

436
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,930
We got a long ride back
to Langham ahead of us.

437
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:15,088
So tell me,
what happened between you and Oliver?

438
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,835
Did he find someone else?
Or were you not tall enough?

439
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:27,050
Do you have a sister?
Because I hear he loves sisters.

440
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,890
Oliver seems to think that
because you look like Laurel,

441
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,395
that you could become her.

442
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,315
And what do you think?

443
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,440
I think...

444
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,493
You should get used to living in cages.

445
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,532
There's a part of him
that blames himself for Laurel's death.

446
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,539
It's who he is.

447
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,667
So when he looks at you,

448
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,300
he doesn't just see Laurel.

449
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,679
He sees his shot at redemption.

450
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:11,264
Wow, it must be really frustrating
that he doesn't listen to you.

451
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,685
No, I'm used to it.

452
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,416
How'd she escape?

453
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,877
The power went off
and the dampener along with it.

454
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,717
And Goldilocks huffed and puffed
and blew the door down.

455
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,802
That's not exactly how her power works.

456
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,963
Was there something wrong
with Cisco's specs?

457
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,345
Because didn't we just replicate
the Pipeline's security system?

458
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,598
We did. I let her go.

459
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,597
- What?
- Damn, blondie.

460
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,399
I'm sorry. But, everyone, just relax.
I put tracking nanites in her water,

461
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,228
- the same ones we used to find Malcolm.
- Well, that makes everything better.

462
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,981
Isn't that exactly how you used Anarky
to find Darhk last year?

463
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:11,324
- Could we have the room please?
- Seriously? This is getting good.

464
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,656
Rene, Rory, come on, guys.

465
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,838
You could've been hurt.

466
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,260
What ever happened to
"if we change her circumstances"?

467
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:33,016
You risked your life to get a line
on Prometheus because of Billy.

468
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,766
Well, now that you're killing again,
I thought why not put it to use?

469
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,059
You know,
we're gonna get justice for Billy.

470
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,062
But first,
we need to take care of your ex.

471
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,018
Who's not even your ex.

472
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,045
<i>There's a part of him
that blames himself for Laurel's death.</i>

473
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,539
<i>It's who he is.</i>

474
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:09,345
<i>So when he looks at you,
he sees more than just Laurel.</i>

475
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,181
<i>He sees his shot at redemption.</i>

476
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,938
It's like I said,
you know me better than almost anyone.

477
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,820
I failed Laurel before.

478
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,825
I can't fail her again.

479
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,782
I don't have to
remind you that this isn't her.

480
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,660
I know.

481
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,752
Our Laurel's gone.

482
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,123
She's the last chance that I have.

483
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,584
Okay?

484
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,261
Billy is my responsibility.

485
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,602
And we will get justice for him.

486
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,390
I'll let you know
when the trackers metabolize and go live.

487
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,704
You've been here for just few months
and already you think you know everything.

488
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,540
Did it not occur to you
that I could be playing Kovar?

489
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,540
- I don't believe that.
- Of course, you don't.

490
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,338
Because you don't understand

491
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,386
that circumstances are
what makes a thing poison or nectar.

492
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,719
You believe
your fool's errand to kill Kovar

493
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:41,555
because you think that you are responsible
for this darkness that's inside of you.

494
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:47,526
Like a baby blaming himself for being
left out in the cold by his mother.

495
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,228
If it weren't for that island,

496
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,075
you would be
that harmless American douchebag

497
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,573
that you pretended to be
in Kovar's casino.

498
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,208
So I guess I'm just supposed to
listen to you instead?

499
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,840
I can give you family.

500
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14,094
One that does not see a monster,
but a brother.

501
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,884
All I'm asking in return
is your obedience.

502
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,394
- Or else?
- Hmm.

503
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,439
Or else...

504
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,201
You don't leave this room alive.

505
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,578
So Mom and Dad
are going 12 rounds upstairs.

506
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,204
They're just having a discussion.

507
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,921
Look, I know that I took the teasing
too far earlier.

508
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,089
I can be an acquired taste,

509
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,262
but I'm sorry to hear about Paul
and that I made you feel worse about it.

510
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,472
Thanks.

511
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,521
- That's really big of you.
- So what are you doing down here?

512
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:14,071
Well, since the Black Siren's cry works on
a more powerful frequency than Laurel's,

513
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,315
these are useless.

514
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,403
So, I was trying to see if there was a way
to make the dampener portable

515
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,580
- so the next time we go up against her...
- You can take her powers away.

516
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,286
That's awesome.

517
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,998
Yeah, well, ideas are one thing,
executing them is another.

518
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,872
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

519
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,050
That maybe instead of beating yourself up
about what you can't do,

520
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,093
take a moment
and appreciate what you can do.

521
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,800
'Cause it's pretty bad-ass.

522
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,480
General Walker. Sorry, General,

523
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,650
but I cannot let you take John Diggle
without the proper paperwork turned in.

524
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,778
- Excuse me?
- Forms I-55 and W-67.

525
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,906
And the completed transfer assignment
signed by the Langham warden.

526
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,610
Never seen a D.A. get involved in military
matters. And on the defense side.

527
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,821
I'm expanding my practice.

528
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,418
Anything else?

529
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,302
It's not common for someone of your rank

530
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,968
to personally supervise
a prisoner transfer.

531
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,599
I make exceptions for traitors
and terrorists.

532
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,517
I'll need a district judge
to ratify the transfer papers.

533
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,477
That could take a few hours,
maybe even a few days.

534
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,945
Do you have the Attorney General
on speed dial? I do.

535
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,661
And she owes me a favor.
I can have you disbarred in 15 seconds.

536
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,702
I expect the prisoner to be
in my custody in 24 hours. Am I clear?

537
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,623
Mmm-hmm.

538
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,049
Tracker's live.

539
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,089
- Where is she?
- The nanites just metabolized.

540
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,008
I'm triangulating them
with a keyhole satellite feed.

541
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,763
Remind me to upgrade our Internet
tomorrow. Got it.

542
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,770
1400 block, Brand Boulevard.
Pulling up keyhole now.

543
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,518
I think I have something that'll help.

544
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,979
A mobile version of the dampener
from S.T.A.R. Labs.

545
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,151
- "Think"?
- I might need some more time with it.

546
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,483
The circuitry is pretty complex
and I'm feeling a lot of pressure...

547
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,940
Felicity can come with and help you.

548
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,571
Hold up. I'm not getting a good enough
reading off the thermal imaging.

549
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,701
There's no way to tell if Black Siren
is actually with

550
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,157
Prometheus, and the whole point of doing
this is to catch that son of a... bitch.

551
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,367
We need to wait until we get
visual confirmation of Prometheus.

552
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,787
We are not waiting for anything.
We're gonna bring her in right now.

553
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,872
Get on board with this. Suit up!

554
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,715
This is private property.
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

555
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,308
I'm just waiting for a friend.

556
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,721
She's here. Create a perimeter. Go!

557
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,188
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

558
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,649
Kidding. I think people in Florida
heard that. We need to hurry.

559
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,866
- She was crazy. She could scream.
- Run away and call the police.

560
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,048
Don't move, Trinity.

561
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,754
Oh.

562
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,008
I thought you'd be someone else.
Disappointing.

563
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,433
- This should do it.
- Are you sure?

564
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:38,938
No, but we're out of time.

565
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,110
Prometheus.

566
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,306
Diazepam. That should slow you down.

567
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,705
Diazepam.
You could say I have a tolerance.

568
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,416
But you shouldn't be worrying about me
right now.

569
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,711
Ah, Felicity.

570
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:45,001
I'm so sorry, but I think it's about time
that I kill you.

571
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,048
Felicity or me!

572
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,345
Laurel!

573
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,898
Don't do this.

574
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,192
There's no coming back for you.

575
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,982
If you kill Felicity,

576
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,696
then you're killing that part of yourself
that existed before you lost your family.

577
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,832
If you end this now,
we can find that person again,

578
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,043
together.

579
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,961
She was never there.

580
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,069
You really need to shut your damn mouth.

581
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,408
', Pumpkin.

582
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,544
Hey. Kept my wrist straight.

583
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,385
You turn me over, I'll be dead before you
get back to your office.

584
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,934
I believe you.

585
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,269
You know, when I woke up,
I didn't think that I'd be pissing off

586
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,149
one of the most powerful men
in the military.

587
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,899
Hit me.

588
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,276
What?

589
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,610
Hit me.

590
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,916
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your prisoner just decked me.

591
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,628
- Unsatisfied with your legal counsel?
- Who knows?

592
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,298
But we are in Starling County,

593
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,138
and the County Code Section 47.15

594
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,313
specifically states
that the District Attorney, me,

595
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,224
can supersede transfers
to other jurisdictions

596
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,812
if the suspect commits a secondary crime
within my jurisdiction.

597
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,741
Attacking a city official
is a very serious offense, Mr. Diggle.

598
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,573
I think I'm gonna have to
prosecute this one myself.

599
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,031
It could take a while.

600
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,496
Fine. I'll be back with a writ
signed by the President.

601
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,583
Can't wait.
I've always wanted her autograph.

602
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,932
You know how people say,
"I hate to say I told you so"?

603
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,518
I don't hate it. I freakin' love it.

604
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,774
You really weren't kidding
about that acquired-taste thing.

605
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,647
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel with you.

606
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,782
It's cool. I can take it.

607
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,036
You were right, Rene.
I need to start embracing

608
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,948
what I can do for the team,
instead of what I can't.

609
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,042
That's what I'm talking about.
More tinkering and less fighting.

610
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,211
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it "tinkering".

611
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,006
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yeah, what's up?

612
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,835
You put your hands on me like that
one more time, and I'll kick your ass.

613
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,849
Oh. Good talk.

614
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,729
God! This is why I usually leave
the punching to you guys.

615
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,438
- It was a memorable punch.
- Mmm-hmm.

616
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:37,320
Yeah, well, typing is going to be a bit of
a challenge in the next couple of days.

617
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,614
Serves me right.
Because I let Black Siren go,

618
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,536
one of those guards could have
gotten killed.

619
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,034
We almost got Prometheus.

620
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,288
Your plan worked. He was there.

621
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,798
No, if it worked,
we'd be putting cuffs on him right now.

622
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,295
We'll get there.

623
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,961
We'll get him.

624
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,393
I'm sorry she wasn't her.

625
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,686
I know.

626
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,850
I'm sorry about Billy. He was a good man.

627
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:13,977
Like you.

628
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,025
So I'm guessing that Laurel is
on her way back to Central City then?

629
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,279
Secure lockup at A.R.G.U.S.
I'm keeping her close

630
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:28,125
because if there is anything left
of the real Laurel in there,

631
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,788
I'm gonna find it.

632
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,255
You know what?

633
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,502
I could really get used to
this new found optimism of yours.

634
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,099
I'm done asking. Follow me or die.

635
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,567
Find out what's happening.

636
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,317
Hello, Mr. Queen. My name is Talia.

637
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,648
I've been looking for you.

638
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,532
This doesn't feel right.
They're just taking it away like this.

639
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,748
We should build a new one.

640
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,255
- I think we can do better.
- Yeah? What are you thinking?

641
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,007
I haven't kept my promise to Laurel.

642
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,506
You're gonna train a new Black Canary?

643
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,260
I think that somewhere out there, there is
a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy.

644
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,928
Now all we've gotta do is find her.

645
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,689
You boys want another round?

646
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,569
No. I was thinkin' of ordering
somethin' that's not on the menu, huh?

647
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,400
Where you goin', baby?

648
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,111
<i>Seriously, could you two be
any more of a cliche'?</i>

649
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:34,243
Don't worry, sweetheart.
There's plenty of me to go around.

650
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,542
I thought people like you
only existed in the movies.

651
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,751
You know, two guys trying to
overcompensate for their lack of manhood

652
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,757
by taking it out on a defenseless woman.

653
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,920
What are you gonna do about it?

654
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,813
That.
