Which begs the question--
why aren't you arresting him?

We sent in an ESU team

the night Anna died.

charged us,

I've been going
about this all wrong.

343
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:02,028
When I started
the Atom project,

344
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,798
it was all about
avenging Anna.

345
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,434
But what it has become about

346
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:12,071
is...protecting
the people I care for.

to use that thing?

other weapons here.

- Roy!

I thought we were on the same
page with this.

354
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:35,695
That was before Brick
kidnapped three aldermen.

355

Laurel said she knows
where they are.

356
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,565
We put their location through Felicity's
surveillance program

357
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,901
but Brick keeps moving them.
We can still track them,

but the window's closing.

is going to work.

And why does
he want to kill you?

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,580
Promise, promise,
I will not crash it.

645
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:25,215
I've got to be honest;

646
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:26,817
I'd feel a little
more confident

647
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,685
in your aeronautic
abilities if you knew,

648
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:32,055
for instance, that helicopters don't
actually have keys.

649
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:34,224
They don't have keys?

650
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:34,974
No.

651
00:32:34,998 --> 00:32:36,227
Is it on the roof?

652
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:38,028
Yeah, it's
on the roof.

653
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,930
Thank you!

654
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:43,099
I'm going to hold you
to the no crash promise.

655
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:46,336
You do realize it's been
five years since

656
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,937
I've flown one
of these things, right?

657
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:49,272
It's like riding
a bicycle, I hope.

658
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:50,774
Do you have
Brick's location?

659
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:53,043
According to the last signal
from the pacemaker,

660
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:56,046
Brick has the aldermen
in a warehouse at 16th and Kent.

661
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:57,647
Not for long,
he doesn't.

662
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:11,894
Man on walkie talkie: We got a chopper
outside. Take a look.

663
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:14,766
Roger that.
Checking it now.

664
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:54,071
I guess we're even now.

665
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,907
Follow the hallway
20 yards.

666
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,277
Turn left.

667
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,779
Aldermen!

668
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,550
Come on!
Don't worry!

669
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:07,218
We're going to get
you out of here.

670
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,886
Let's go.

671
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:11,422
Go. Go!

672
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:23,968
Dig, I'm going to need you
to find me a way out of here.

673
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,603
Copy that.

674
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,472
I still don't like
hitting women.

675
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:32,376
But I could make
an exception for you.

676
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:35,346
Black Canary:
So come and get me.

677
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:40,084
You're getting warmer.

678
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:45,322
I will keep
this city safe.

679
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,458
By killing anyone
that doesn't do what you say?

680
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,660
Something like that.

681
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:51,295
Warmer...

682
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,497
Warmer...

683
00:34:53,499 --> 00:34:56,100
We're not going to let you--

684
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,267
[Groaning]

685
00:35:29,938 --> 00:35:32,706
Well, it's--it's done.

686
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,441
Bodies will not be found.

687
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:37,611
Ok, Maseo, I get you wanting
to go back before,

688
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,313
but that was before.

689
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:42,382
When Ra's finds out that
you betrayed the League...

690
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,789
Maseo!

691
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:52,025
Why the hell
did you do that?!

692
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,960
I didn't. You did.

693
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:57,364
In a successful
attempt to escape.

694
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:03,303
Or you could just come back
to Starling City with me.

695
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:10,010
[Speaking Japanese]

696
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,208
[Clears throat] Can I talk to you
for a minute?

697
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,844
If you're going
to bluff with a fake virus sample,

698
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,346
let me in on it.

699
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:49,382
- I wasn't bluffing.
- What does that mean?

700
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:52,652
That--that the Alpha we
stole from the military was a fake?

701
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:55,054
That Amanda Waller knew
I would try something like this.

702
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,925
She must have switched out
the vial before I took it.

703
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,427
Maseo! You were
willing to risk

704
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,229
letting hundreds,

705
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:05,398
maybe thousands
of people die?

706
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,634
For my wife...yes.

707
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:12,371
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for my family.

708
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:23,783
Thank you.

709
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,785
You saved my life.

710
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,729
Dad?

711
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:41,400
[Chuckles]

712
00:37:41,402 --> 00:37:44,370
Both aldermen are back
with their families.

713
00:37:44,372 --> 00:37:47,506
Nice job.
For all the good it did.

714
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:48,774
What does that mean?

715
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,643
Mayor Castle caved.

716
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,611
She's pulling SCPD
out of the Glades.

717
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:56,282
But why? Brick doesn't have
the aldermen anymore.

718
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:57,750
No, but what he does have
is the home address

719
00:37:57,752 --> 00:37:59,585
of every city council member
and their family,

720
00:37:59,587 --> 00:38:01,286
and the means to hurt them.

721
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:03,522
Played that card
15 minutes ago.

722
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:06,125
Hey, sweetie, sweetheart, hey,

723
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:09,294
how about we, uh, cry over
each other's shoulders?

724
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:11,730
Over dinner,
at the Chinese place you love.

725
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:15,133
I can't.
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,837
What's going on
with you, sweetheart?

727
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,739
Why are you trying
to avoid me?

728
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:22,875
I'll explain
everything.

729
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:25,010
Just...not tonight.

730
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,345
You ok?

731
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:30,148
I'm fine, daddy.
I'm fine.

732
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,373
Are you ready to leave?

733
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,008
No.

734
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,677
I'm not leaving.

735
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:02,947
Is this supposed to make up
for me missing your adolescence,

736
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:06,217
this routine of listening
and then disobeying me?

737
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,286
Just hear me out.

738
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,288
You told me that
we were in danger.

739
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,024
You even told me
who was after us.

740
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:15,527
But what
you didn't tell me

741
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:17,862
is why.

742
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:19,664
Yes, I did.

743
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,266
Because Ra's al Ghul
wants us dead.

744
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:23,701
That's pretty much the case
anywhere we go.

745
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,171
So why run?

746
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,675
Why not stay
and fight?

747
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:33,044
Seven months ago,

748
00:39:33,046 --> 00:39:35,413
I asked you
to teach me.

749
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,582
To teach me how
to not be afraid

750
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:41,119
and how to not
get hurt.

751
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:44,188
So why are you
asking me to be afraid now?

752
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,557
I am not asking you.
I am telling you.

753
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,526
You should be very afraid.

754
00:39:48,528 --> 00:39:51,996
Well, I'm not. 'Cause my father
taught me not to be.

755
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,664
You taught me how
to stand my ground

756
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:56,567
and how to not give
an inch in a battle.

757
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:57,935
I'm not afraid
of this man

758
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,871
and you shouldn't
be, either.

759
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:02,940
He should be
afraid of us.

760
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,810
Then we'll stay.

761
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:18,956
Your helicopter

762
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,424
is back on the roof.

763
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:22,093
I didn't crash it.

764
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:23,627
Turns out...

765
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,496
It actually had keys.

766
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:27,131
And this.

767
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:36,307
The reason you couldn't
get the Nanite chip to function

768
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,942
is because what you
actually need...

769
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:43,414
is a quantum
processor.

770
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:46,984
The design is elegant.

771
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,420
Hmm.

772
00:40:49,422 --> 00:40:52,923
Thought you weren't going to help me
on my suicide mission.

773
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,260
Well, that's the thing.

774
00:40:57,362 --> 00:40:59,530
With my help,
you might not end up dead.

775
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:05,903
Hey.

776
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:08,071
I thought you knew
about this whole neighborhood

777
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:10,440
turning into a scene
from "The Purge."

778
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:12,075
We didn't even
open tonight.

779
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:14,978
I forgot my music files here
and I've got another gig.

780
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,648
Cheating on me with
another club manager.

781
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,816
Well, I heard a rumor
you were leaving town.

782
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:23,086
Happy to say that
those rumors are false.

783
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:25,922
That's good news.
For both of us.

784
00:41:25,924 --> 00:41:27,958
Don't get so ahead
of yourself.

785
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,726
My hard drive's up there.

786
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,695
