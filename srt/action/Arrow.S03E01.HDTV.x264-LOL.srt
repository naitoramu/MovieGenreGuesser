00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,564
You're just a low level
street dealer, a pill pusher.

162
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,733
Oh, those pills I push?

163
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:36,985
Are known as Vertigo.

164
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:40,071
In the wake
of the count,

165
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:43,241
I tinkered some
with his formula,

166
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:47,946
introduced an additive produced
by certain mushrooms.

167
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:51,216
My Vertigo
reveals the face

168
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:53,251
of your greatest fear.

[Growls]

170
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,895
As I was saying...

171
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:06,982
Lack of leadership.
I nominate myself.

172
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,401
Any objections?

173
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:15,106
Our course of action
is straight as an arrow.

174
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,526
Gentlemen...

175
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,811
We're going
to kill him.

176
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:22,047
Hey, hey!
How was work?

177
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:25,884
"It" is not work. It is a soul crushing
exercise in misery

178
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,036
that offers health and dental.
Suffice it to say,

179
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:30,922
I am highly motivated to help convince
the board to sell you back the company.

180
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:34,392
Unfortunately, you don't really have the
qualifications to run Queen Consolidated,

181
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:37,262
but what you do have
is passion.

182
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:39,831
You care about the company
and the people that work there.

183
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,566
That's what you have
to get across to them.

184
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,134
You got to speak
from the heart.

185
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:46,304
Felicity...

186
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:48,974
Would you like to go out to
dinner with me?

187
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:51,476
- I'm being serious here, Oliver.
- So am I.

188
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:54,312
I don't want to read...
Too much into this,

189
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:56,231
but are you asking me
out on a date?

190
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:59,534
Like an actual date?
Like a...Date-date?

191
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:01,987
Su--I mean, the implication
being with dinner

192
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:03,321
- that you...
- Usually I'm the one

193
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,624
talking in sentence fragments.

[Chuckles]

195

Would you like to go
to dinner with me?

196
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:16,301
Yes.

197
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,099
Oliver: Go.

198
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:24,279
Kelvin Nico just knocked
over a liquor store.

199

Nico's in Steelgrave's crew.

200
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,866
Send his photo to Roy.

201
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,035
- Get me Felicity.
- You got it.

202
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,154
Felicity: I can't
talk right now.

203
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,589
I'm at work.

204
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,926
Could I ask you guys
just to wait one moment?

205
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,629
Someone's calling
for tech support.

206
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:43,315
Oh, you are going to get me
so incredibly fired.

207
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:46,318
Okay, I am hacked into
the city's database. I am running

Oliver: Do you like Italian?

209
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:50,438
- What?
- For tonight.

210
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
You like Italian, right?
Everyone likes Italian.

211
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,526
Oliver, you're in the middle
of a high speed chase.

212
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,495
I'm multitasking.

213
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,030
I got him.
He's in the sewer.

214
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,916
I'm picking up his cell phone
underneath. He's at the corner

215
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,367
of Grand and Ames.

216
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:05,537
And yes, I love Italian.

217
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,291
Detective Lance-- Captain Lance--
is also in pursuit.

You are welcome.
I have to go.

219

The Arrow:
Detective...Thank you.

220
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,898
- You had it handled.
- For what you said today.

221
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,950
I wish I could do more.

222
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,236
You've already done
more than enough. I've got to go.

223
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,487
Some place
I have to be.

224
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,823
You got a hot date
or something?

Amanda: So this morning
makes how many

226

escape attempts
in the last five months?

227
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,548
Nine.

228
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,583
What we have here is a failure
to reach an understanding.

[Exhales]
Go to hell.

230

So this is my reward
from saving you from drowning

231
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:58,723
in that freighter
off the coast of Lian Yu?

Yeah.

233
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,260
Why'd you do that?

234
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,262
That's need
to know.

235

Suffice it to say, I have need
of a man of your capacity.

236
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:12,404
I don't care.

237
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:15,607
I don't care about anything
except going home.

238
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,692
And you should know that.

239
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:20,078
You should know
that I will never stop

240
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,913
trying to escape.

241
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,448
And you should know that it's
extremely easy to kill someone

the world already
thinks is dead.

another way, then.

Hi. Thank you for waiting.

Ah, no problem.
I just want to buy this.

This is a satellite frequency
communicator TX40.

Yeah, I'm trying to breach
a Tor-secured firewall

250
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,059
and I need
something to help me

251
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,194
piggyback off
a keyhole hexagon satellite, so...

252
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:55,647
I did that once.

WI-Fi signal,

crowd-sourced stealth processing.

Huh.

Formerly of Queen
Consolidated.

Do you mind if I ask you something--
why are you here?

259
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:09,377
How do you know who I am?

260
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,246
I know a guy
who might be interested

261
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,914
in hiring someone
with your expertise.

262
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,884
I'm not actually...looking
for a new job right now.

God help me.

264
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,670
But I can help you buy this.

265
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,839
Unless I can't.
I mean, I shouldn't.

266
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,140
You shouldn't buy this.

267
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:23,675
OK. Clearly
you don't understand

268
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,343
how this whole
sales thing works.

269
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:27,562
The next gen model, the TX50,
comes out in a few months.

270
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,681
I got to touch one last year.
Pure bliss.

271
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,816
And if you want to breach
Tor-level security,

272
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:33,985
you should really
deploy a remote administration tool.

273

Here's the URL.

Happy hacking.

276
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:41,159
I certainly hope so.

277
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,165
False alarm.

278
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,001
Are you sure?
These contractions...

279

Just Braxton-Hicks. You're not
even four centimeters dilated.

I feel like an M1-A1.

It's a tank.
Think a big, big tank.

You did the right
thing coming in.

You don't want
your husband--

284
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,297
- Boyfriend.
- Ex-husband.

285
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,299
To be delivering the baby on the side
of the freeway.

286
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,684
You can
get dressed now.

00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,686
All right.

Are you OK?

Yeah, yeah, I'm not
the one that's nine months pregnant.

00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,141
You look a little scared.

291
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,193
Honey, please, I've thrown down
with the Taliban,

292

Malcolm Merlyn,
and a host

293
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:18,863
of Mirakuru-powered
human weapons.

294
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,032
I'm terrified.

Hi. [Chuckles]

[Chuckles]

300
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,085
- What?
- Nothing.

301
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,754
- I'm just--
- Nervous?

302
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:17,005
Yeah.

00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,007
Line forms behind me.

304
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,092
Scotch. Neat.

305
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,627
Just the water
for me, thanks.

306
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,262
Are you--are you sure?

307
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,097
The booze might sort of
help with the whole--

308
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:29,517
the alcohol is not going to mix well with
the three benzos I took.

309
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,462
Am I being crazy?

310
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,713
I mean, what do we have
to be nervous about?

311
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,109
Well, we've already
exhausted every topic

312
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,145
that one would normally talk about
on a first date

313
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,479
and a second date
and a third date,

314
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,314
and every date,
actually,

315
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:46,317
and I've already
seen you shirtless.

316
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,903
Multiple times.

317
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,156
Shirtless,
all the time.

318
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,158
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

319

The five years that
I was away...

322
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:08,072
I wasn't always on Lian Yu.

a lot recently about...

00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,795
The choices
that I had to make.

329
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:35,200
Those years sound like they were full
of a whole lot of suck.

330

I'm sorry.

331

I'm just a little
out of my element.

The entire time
that I was gone,

333
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,763
I could never...

334
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:51,799
completely trust someone.

335
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,170
And when that
goes on for so long,

really care about?

00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:02,753
And I need you.

483
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:05,038
And I just spoke
to Ned Foster.

484
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,923
He said the board is primed.

485
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,542
You just have to go
in there and wow them.

486
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:11,261
Which I am pretty sure
is a business term.

487
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:12,879
I'm afraid we have a situation.

488
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:15,215
Apparently there's another
bidder for the company.

489
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:16,883
Really? Who?

490
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:19,269
Ray Palmer.

491
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:22,389
Nice to meet you.
Love your company.

492
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:24,891
Nice to see you again,
Miss Smoak.

493
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,727
You two know each other?

494
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:29,362
So sorry I am late.
Heh, traffic was terrible.

495
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:31,565
Which is why I took
my helicopter.

496
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,734
I parked on your roof.
I hope that's OK.

497
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:35,569
You guys validate, right?

498
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:39,206
Oh, frack.

499
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,408
Two years ago,
the people of Starling City

500
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,326
thought I was dead.

501
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,712
I came back.

502
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:48,415
And so can
Queen Consolidated.

503
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,001
With Starling National
Bank's new investment,

504
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:55,088
we can take QC out of receivership
and into the future.

505
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:59,142
I mean,
this company's my family.

506
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:04,898
And as my mother
always said...

507
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,485
There is nothing more important
to me than family.

508
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,937
Thank you.

511

Thank you all
for coming out today.

I promise to be brief,
if not a little entertaining.

515

Ahh. Oh, that's one
of my new smart watches.

516
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:37,764
I'm very proud of those.

it works for you?

518
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:44,471
Yeah, good. Anyway.
Science. Numbers.

519
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:50,110
These numbers show
QC's performance

520
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:51,978
under Mr. Queen's
management.

521
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,147
I'm using that term
extremely, b-t-w.

522
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:55,799
Also b-t-w,
these numbers

523
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,651
aren't sanitized
for Wall Street.

524
00:26:57,653 --> 00:26:58,819
This is raw
information

525
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:00,320
from your company's
own servers.

526
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,239
How did he get into
our computers?

527
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,541
Something tells me he deployed
a remote administration tool.

528
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:06,409
But the truth is,

529
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:09,830
this company's woes are a symptom of
a much larger problem.

530
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:13,166
And that problem
is Starling City.

531
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,502
Queen Consolidated
can't hope to survive

532
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:18,672
if the city
it's located in is dying.

533
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:22,008
Guess what? It is.

534
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,678
Nobody wants
to live here anymore.

535
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,396
[Chuckles] And after
two terrorist attacks,

536
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:28,064
who can blame them?

537
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:31,518
This city
still needs saving.

538
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,521
And that is my vision
for this company.

539
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,023
To not only see it
rise from the ashes,

540
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:40,744
but to take this city with it
to that new horizon.

541
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,747
And that new day has a name.

542
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:48,535
[Applause]

543
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:53,089
Oliver!

544
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,624
I'm sorry.

545
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:56,877
I really thought
it was going to go our way.

546
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,846
So did I. But maybe the company's
better off with Dr. Palmer.

547
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:01,848
I couldn't make time
for QC last year,

548
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,717
and trying to get the company back now,
it's selfish.

549
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,886
That's something
that the old me would have done.

550
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:08,054
And if the past 12 hours
have reminded me of anything,

551
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:10,857
it's that two years ago, I made
the decision to put Oliver Queen aside

552
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:14,144
and be the Arrow.
It's not a choice I get to unmake.

553
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:15,612
Last night at the restaurant,
you didn't feel that way.

554
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:17,030
Look what happened,
Felicity.

555
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:19,566
Oliver! The explosion
wasn't your fault.

556
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:21,701
When Werner hit me
with the Vertigo dart,

557
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,737
he told me
that his formula,

558
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:26,957
it shows us
our worst fear.

559
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:29,492
And I saw myself.

560
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,879
You don't really think
you're afraid of yourself, do you?

561
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,464
I think I'm scared
of what would happen

562
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,716
if I let myself
be Oliver Queen.

563
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:45,970
What did we find out?

564
00:28:45,972 --> 00:28:47,305
You know how we've got
the number of crime bosses

565
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:48,856
in Starling City
down to three?

566
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:50,975
Well, this new guy, Werner,
he wants to make it zero.

567
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:52,777

the competition.

568
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:56,147

Shintawa Shimosawa.

569
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:58,366
What are their
locations?

570
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:01,069
I'm not getting anything
off of last known addresses.

571
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:02,987
Werner could be
moving these guys right now.

572
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:04,622
I'm going as fast as I can!
It's not like these guys

573
00:29:04,624 --> 00:29:07,158
walk around with little GPSs
attached to them.

574
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,693
Unless they do.

575
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:10,328
Petrov, Costa, Shimosawa,

576
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,664

or out on bail.

The heavyweight title fight's tonight.

for crime bosses.

581

to take down one man.

I don't know what
that's supposed to earn me,

but it earns me at least the right
to make my own choices.
