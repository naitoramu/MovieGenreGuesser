1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,254
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,888
- Lyla.
- We need to talk about John.

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,761
<i>He's back in the country.
And he's in prison.</i>

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,016
<i>We are gonna break him out.</i>

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,176
Hey, John.

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,811
I'm not saying you shouldn't do
your penance.

7
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>But do it as Spartan.</i>

8
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,107
Church is planning something.
Something big.

9
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,391
You're talking about the Trust.

10
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,936
At least we definitely know
where Church is now.

11
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,103
We gotta put him down.

12
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,564
Go. Do not die.

13
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,526
- Get him to safety.
- But...

14
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,864
Go!

15
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,956
Don't kill him. He may have his uses.

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,208
We are not gonna write off Rene.

17
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,211
We're gonna find him.
We're gonna bring him back.

18
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,371
<i>Wherever he is.</i>

19
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,510
The Trust goes
to the Brace, 04 in 72.

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,475
How you feeling, my friend?

21
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,609
You can keep
going with the foreplay,

22
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,645
but I'm never giving you what you want.

23
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,565
<i>You remind me of this other guy
I once tortured.</i>

24
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,406
Maybe bigger,
a little more muscle on the frame.

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,331
Look, I was conversing
with this son of a bitch

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:21,670
just like you and I have been
conversing for the past...

27
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,752
What, 20 hours or so?

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,012
<i>My knuckles hurt.</i>

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,175
Even with the brass. I needed a shower.

30
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,343
My lady was waiting for me.

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,231
And this guy
would just not give me what I needed.

32
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:38,895
Not unlike you.

33
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,024
So I said to myself, "Tobias,

34
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,233
"make this guy feel pain
like nobody who's ever lived."

35
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,194
And then it clicked.

36
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,290
It's not the pain that breaks people.

37
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,868
<i>It's fear.</i>

38
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,830
Fear of that pain.

39
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,919
Of what that pain brings.

40
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,048
Of what happens next.

41
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,511
You not gonna finish your story?

42
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,883
Huh?

43
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
Oh.

44
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,933
I got what I wanted from that guy.

45
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,611
So you might wanna think about that
the next time I ask you a question.

46
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,697
Tobias Church. Where is he?

47
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,071
Don't know. Even if I did,

48
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,410
whatever you're gonna do to me,
he's worse.

49
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,119
How sure are you about that?

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,832
Ahh!

51
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,586
Hey, you're a lot cuter
than the green guy.

52
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:53,178
Aww, you're kind of cute, too, in a
"I feel sorry for you" kind of way.

53
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,010
- Where's Church?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

54
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,519
The green guy.

55
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,729
Where is Church?

56
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,063
Look out!

57
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,692
You Okay?

58
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,194
I'm better than this schmuck.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,284
Church. Address. Now.

60
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,241
I heard he's somewhere northwest of here,
maybe by the water.

61
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,701
Half the city's on the water.

62
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,084
I swear, that's all I know.

63
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,089
Come on.

64
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,300
How's it going?

65
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,728
I would punch this monitor
if I didn't know how much it cost.

66
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,980
Also, it'd probably really hurt.

67
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,640
Can you get off your feet, please?

68
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,563
Oliver told me that you were back to work

69
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,569
a week after you were shot
by the Clock King.

70
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,813
Shot in the shoulder.
Not a knife in the back.

71
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,152
I don't need you to remind me.

72
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,066
I have excruciating agony to do that.

73
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,280
Who's that?

74
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,535
Hmm? Telemarketer.

75
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,452
Tell me you've had better luck
than I have had.

76
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,996
We might have narrowed it down
to the northwest part of the city.

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,045
Yeah, so now we're looking for a needle
in a slightly smaller haystack.

78
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,507
I'll run an algorithm cross-referencing
traffic cams with probable locations.

79
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,218
Wow. This place just got really crowded.

80
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,507
<i>He'!-</i>

81
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,348
Do people just walk into
your secret base of operations?

82
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,511
- Yes.
- Yes.

83
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,396
- This is...
- Spartan.

84
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,602
I'm guessing.

85
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,392
You guys must the new kids on the block.

86
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,936
We're more like the Backstreet Boys.

87
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,858
It was funny in my head.

88
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,023
This is Rory Regan and Evelyn Sharp.

89
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,864
John Diggle. And you are missing a man.

90
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,027
<i>Rene Ramirez.</i>

91
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,038
Lyla called in A.R.G.U.S. for the search.
Unfortunately, she's turned up nothing.

92
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,244
It's going around.

93
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,459
We are going to find Rene,
and we're not gonna give up hope

94
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,619
while we're doing it.

95
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,793
I have an early meeting at City Hall,
I will check in with everybody soon.

96
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,679
Is it just my imagination,
or did Oliver just seem...

97
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,099
Optimistic. That's not usually a word
I'd associate with his demeanor.

98
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,805
- Thank you.
- Rene?

99
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,609
<i>- Slow.
- What about the ACU?</i>

100
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,279
Too many cops on Church's dime
keeping him five steps ahead.

101
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,403
And with Conahan gone
and Church's assault on the ACU,

102
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,067
I'm thinking we gotta bring
more men into the fold.

103
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,827
Well, do we have enough guys
that we can trust?

104
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,239
Pike says that a bunch of his men
have volunteered since the attack on ACU.

105
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,873
So, if you want, I can vet 'em,
and I could,

106
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,124
you know,
make sure there's no bad apples.

107
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,580
Please. Let's get that done.

108
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,920
Look, I know
this is one of the last things

109
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,124
you wanna be dealing with right now,
but the re-zoning vote is in a few days.

110
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,253
Allowing us to expand
low-income housing in Orchid Bay?

111
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,420
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,180
Okay, well, we need
a four-fifths majority vote

113
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,099
from City Council in order to pass
the ordinance and...

114
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,259
Who are the hold-outs?

115
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,936
Only one that really matters.
Councilman Kullens.

116
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,439
Yeah, he is decidedly anti-residential.

117
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,100
I was gonna say,
he's the most stubborn man in the city

118
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,816
compared to you, but that works.

119
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,237
Let's get into it.

120
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,279
Anatoly, what is this?

121
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,288
It is time, my friend.

122
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,180
English will suffice, Viktor.

123
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,720
Fine.

124
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,180
What does Bratva mean to you,
Oliver Queen?

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,932
Brotherhood.

126
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,851
<i>Brotherhood is family.</i>

127
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,769
Who are yours?

128
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,233
My father is dead.

129
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,816
- My mother and sister...
- Both dead.

130
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,737
Bratva only know their brothers.

131
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,869
Do you know what I mean by this?

132
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,161
I have no family.

133
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,290
I have no home. I have no name.

134
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,199
We're at the latest probable, Overwatch,
but it's another dead end.

135
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,864
Try not to use that phrase.

136
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,616
Look.

137
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,706
- Is that...
- Blood? Looks like.

138
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,746
Scratch that. We think this is where
Rene was being held.

139
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,039
- "Was"?
<i>- Blood's still fresh.</i>

140
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,253
They must've just moved him.

141
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,378
KH-Ten shows a panel van moving
from that location 40 minutes ago.

142
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,590
Can you track it?

143
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,548
I have been able to every other time
somebody asked me that question.

144
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,141
- Got it.
- Where?

145
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,223
This is a little awkward,

146
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,892
but Oliver made me promise that if we got
our location on Rene,

147
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,557
I would only share it with him.

148
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,559
That's actually not surprising at all.

149
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,863
Lest I forget.

150
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,402
So you can pay the ferry.

151
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,362
Why, man?

152
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,120
'Cause you pissed me off.

153
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,577
NO. Why this city?

154
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,534
<i>Why come here?</i>

155
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,999
And why are you asking me that now?

156
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,540
'Cause, if I'm gonna die tonight,
it'd be nice to know why.

157
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,428
From what I heard, you were popping
in Blüdhaven, in Hub City.

158
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,672
<i>Why you messing with us?</i>

159
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,602
For your water access.

160
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,642
Seriously.

161
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,188
Through Star City's docks

162
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:42,239
I can move thousands of tons of heroin,
Slam, Vertigo.

163
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,781
I'm working on the biggest
consolidation of drug enterprises

164
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,703
anybody has ever seen.

165
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,705
Only thing I'm waiting for

166
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,787
is for Green Arrow
to get out of the picture.

167
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,455
Little man,
that grave ain't gonna dig itself.

168
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,716
So how about you do the digging yourself?

169
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,177
Oh, you think I'm afraid
to get my hands dirty, huh?

170
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,197
Hey, you okay?

171
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,784
I thought Church would put up
more of a fight.

172
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,166
Probably realized he didn't have to.

173
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,004
What do you mean?

174
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,125
I was hurting so bad

175
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,339
it got so I couldn't even see straight.

176
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,220
I barely even remember telling him...

177
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,513
Telling him what?

178
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,509
Who you are.

179
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,346
He knows you're Oliver Queen.

180
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,358
I should've been out there
with you tonight, Oliver.

181
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,740
Digg, you said you needed time.
Don't be afraid to take it.

182
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,034
And tonight
would not have made any difference.

183
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,739
Church didn't want to fight.
He wanted to run.

184
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,700
That's because he knows killing the Mayor
is a lot easier

185
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,121
than killing the Green Arrow.

186
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,825
What? We were all thinking it.

187
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,126
I told Rene to stand down and recover.

188
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,379
Evelyn and Rory are going to watch
Thea and Quentin

189
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,758
in case Church tries to get at me
through them. How's Curtis doing?

190
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,125
He says he wants to get back at it.

191
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,507
Then let's get him on Lyla and J.J.

192
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,339
Good. I'll have Felicity's back.

193
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,885
Oliver, I know you have a security detail,

194
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,891
but you might as well have a bulls-eye
painted on your head.

195
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,142
I can't disappear again.

196
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,848
I'm still dealing with the
fallout from not being around

197
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,012
when the ACU was attacked.

198
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,183
And there is actually a re-zoning vote
that needs my attention.

199
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,443
What? Wait. Doesn't a vote
take a backseat to finding Church

200
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,148
before he tells every criminal in the city
who you are?

201
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,904
I have security, I'll be fine.

202
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,034
Have you ever... Has he ever actually
said that and it turned out to be true?

203
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,902
You agree with her?

204
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,781
Well, I know I said I thought it was
a good idea for us to start a new team,

205
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,915
but what do we have?
A Laurel Lance wannabe,

206
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,040
a weird rag-guy, a lunatic and Curtis.

207
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,791
Curtis just wasn't who I pictured.

208
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,047
They have potential.

209
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,459
One of them got themselves captured
and gave up your name.

210
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,593
- And I'd like you to debrief him.
- Debrief him?

211
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,254
Church told Rene
that he's planning something.

212
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,139
Something big enough
to involve five cities.

213
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,096
So Church just gave up his master plan?

214
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,306
He thought Rene was gonna be dead
five minutes later.

215
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,438
Church is trying to consolidate
the drug trade through Star City,

216
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,147
but he was waiting for the Green Arrow
to be gone before he made his move.

217
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,277
Okay. Well, if that's true,

218
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,063
I think I know a way we can turn
this to our advantage.

219
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm all ears.

220
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,570
Oliver, I know a guy.
Very specific skill set.

221
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,656
I think he could be here in 24 hours.

222
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:35,987
Did you get my message?

223
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,156
Yeah. Quentin and I
can take care of ourselves.

224
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,542
Still doesn't hurt to have a shadow.
Is Councilman Kullens in there?

225
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,544
Yes. He is waiting in your office
with Susan Williams.

226
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,624
Thank you very much, fellas.
I didn't agree to an interview.

227
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,043
Yeah, well, she's shadowing him
for some type of profile.

228
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,508
And I already tried to get her kicked out,

229
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,139
but he was adamant
about having her in there.

230
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,345
Any advice?

231
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,930
Don't screw it up.

232
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,398
Councilman Kullens, hi.

233
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,942
Miss Williams,
it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

234
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,687
Really? Have you watched any of my pieces?

235
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,115
I have, and I think you're off the mark.
In certain instances.

236
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,274
Is that on the record?

237
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,284
If you wanna get an actual quote,
Miss Williams,

238
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,286
you can go through
all the proper channels.

239
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,994
This meeting is strictly
about the re-zoning ordinance.

240
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,535
Yes. Councilman, as you know,
I ran on a platform of unity,

241
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,669
but it is difficult
for a city to be united

242
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,627
when so much of the zoning within it
remains exclusionary.

243
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,339
We need to open it up.
Allow for more affordable housing,

244
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,676
give the people the chance
to start over and rebuild.

245
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,929
The second the money starts rolling in,
those families get squeezed out.

246
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,347
By crony capitalists.

247
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,557
That's not going to happen here.

248
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,892
Hard to believe,
considering your family's history.

249
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,807
I'm sorry, Councilman. I don't follow.

250
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,817
Well, the type of re-zoning
you're proposing

251
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,853
happened downtown 25 years ago.

252
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,024
But instead of affordable housing,
we got sky-rises.

253
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,407
One of them became
the offices of Queen Consolidated.

254
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,156
Is that true, Mr. Mayor?

255
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,497
I'll consider that a "no comment."

256
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,205
I can tell, you have good intentions.

257
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,873
But politics is the art of the real.

258
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,843
I'm sorry. I'm not changing my vote.

259
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,892
Okay, maybe
you should just put an arrow in him.

260
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,400
<i>That was a bit more than I expected
to get done on my lunch break.</i>

261
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,528
Is this a normal Wednesday
afternoon for you?

262
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,531
Well, I had to make up for last night.
I hate canceling last minute.

263
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,656
I got a feeling I'm gonna be
the one canceling on you for a change.

264
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,079
I got a promotion.

265
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,119
I signed on with the ACU.

266
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,409
Oliver's Anti-Crime Unit?

267
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,753
This isn't gonna be weird, right?

268
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,790
- Hmm?
- Me reporting to your ex-fiancé?

269
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,917
Yeah, what could possibly
be weird about that?

270
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,089
- Felicity?
- Mmm-hmm.

271
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,300
Does Mayor Queen
know that we're seeing each other?

272
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,256
It really doesn't help if you call him
"Mayor Queen."

273
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,424
Felicity...

274
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,102
Definitely. Yeah, he's definitely...

275
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,391
Definitely aware of you.

276
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,607
Love what you've
done with the place.

277
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,520
It's not much, man, but it's home.

278
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,200
And it's safe, especially
now that Felicity's teched up the place.

279
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,525
Thanks for coming out.

280
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,239
No problem, man.
Let's just get this over with.

281
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,779
But I gotta tell you.

282
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,414
There's nothing you could tell me
that I haven't already told myself.

283
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,499
I'm torn apart over this.

284
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,160
Is that what you think this is? A lecture?

285
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,288
What I deserve is a beat-down.

286
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,796
When's the last time
you looked in the mirror?

287
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,963
But maybe something good
can come out of this, man.

288
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,297
Like, I don't know,
maybe you saw something,

289
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,891
heard something
that can help us bring down Church.

290
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,389
I already told Oliver
everything I remember, man.

291
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,598
I know,

292
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,230
but traumatic events have a way
of doing funny things to the memory.

293
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,397
And if you think what you went through
was not traumatic, again I say, mirror.

294
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,981
My dad taught me how to take a beating.

295
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,647
I know, Rene. You're tough.
I get that, man.

296
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,279
But this isn't about being tough, okay?
It's about...

297
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,618
Look, man, I've been where you are, okay?

298
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,703
And I know it's not easy,
but if we talk about this

299
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,284
and go through it step by step...

300
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,085
Look, I said I don't know.

301
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,248
I should be out there trying to fix this.
Not in here with you, playing therapist.

302
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,342
- Oliver says stay put.
- And I'm staying put.

303
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,922
But I don't remember anything.

304
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,686
<i>CHURCH". Yeah, yeah, sure.</i>

305
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,644
Just make sure the AmerTek gear
gets to the Brace.

306
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,184
I want everybody locked and loaded.

307
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,193
No, he's not gonna be a problem.

308
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,696
The Green Arrow'll be dead by then.

309
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,656
Louis, I'm gonna need to hit you back.

310
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,041
You like this place?
I'm getting a penthouse built.

311
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,997
Gonna let me see the whole city.

312
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,504
I told you to stay away
from the Green Arrow.

313
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,257
I don't work for you.
And the Green Arrow found me.

314
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,210
You kidnapped his protégé.

315
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,050
A serendipitous encounter.

316
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,555
And your last.

317
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,396
After getting threatened by a freak,
I hired one of my own.

318
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,775
This was your second warning.
There won't be a third.

319
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,197
I thought you hired me
to kill the Green Arrow.

320
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,655
Nope. You're gonna kill the Mayor.

321
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,418
What is Susan Williams
doing in your office?

322
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,872
I agreed to an off-camera interview.

323
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,839
Okay, come here.

324
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,597
Okay. So, did you go out last night
as the Green Arrow and get hit

325
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,052
really hard, in the head?

326
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,683
Susan Williams is in our lives.

327
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,560
Thea, if we don't make her an ally,
then she's gonna remain an enemy.

328
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,141
Okay, but she's poison.

329
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,807
Well, it turns out that if you ingest
small amounts of poison over time,

330
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,520
you can develop an immunity.

331
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:01,942
Good morning.

332
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,397
When I got your call last night

333
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,237
I thought someone in my office
was playing a prank on me.

334
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,322
Well, I thought
Thea made a good point yesterday

335
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,533
when she suggested
that you go through the proper channels.

336
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,368
- Hmm.
- Please.

337
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,169
The interview I had in mind
was going to be on camera.

338
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,004
Baby steps. May I ask you a question?

339
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,007
I don't think you understand
how this interview thing works.

340
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,470
Have your attacks
on my administration been

341
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,256
personal or are they just good ratings?

342
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,225
Don't see why they can't be both.
Why are you asking?

343
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,100
Because I'm trying to figure out how hard
I'm gonna have to work to win you over.

344
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,233
You seem like a nice guy.
But you're not a real politician.

345
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,865
I am underqualified.

346
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:50,654
Vastly. And the city,
my home, is suffering because of it.

347
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,659
I appreciate
the fact that I haven't earned your trust.

348
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,502
Yet. But, Susan,

349
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,255
as someone who professes
to care about Star City,

350
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,917
I think that you owe
it to the people of Star City

351
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,756
to give me an opportunity
to earn that trust.

352
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,420
And I promise you

353
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,511
I can't do that
if I'm spending all of my energy

354
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,017
dodging all of these grenades
that you're lobbing at me.

355
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,762
So, here's my idea.

356
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,852
You give me one month with no attacks.

357
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,110
Let me show you what I can do.
And if I don't deliver,

358
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,438
it's open season.

359
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,576
One month.

360
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,668
- What's this?
- My personal cell.

361
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,044
Why would I need that?

362
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,038
I think you can figure it out.

363
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,513
To survivors of <i>Amazo.</i>

364
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,423
May we experience as much sorrow

365
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,434
as drops of wine
about to be left in glass. <i>Prochnost.</i>

366
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,802
<i>Prochnost.</i>

367
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,232
I get us more drinks.
Something stronger.

368
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,768
All right.

369
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,990
It's a party, Viktor.
Let me get you a drink.

370
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,743
You may have passed all the tests
and said all the right things,

371
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,409
but I do not believe for a second
you are Bratva.

372
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,874
Then you weren't paying attention
during the ceremony, I guess.

373
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,966
Look around you. These men are here
because government men like Kovar

374
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,922
have taken everything from them.

375
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:34,433
The Bratva is means to bring justice
for all those crimes.

376
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,260
Justice is why I'm here.

377
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,853
Yeah, some American castaway
will never understand.

378
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,110
So you can say all the words
that Anatoly feeds you.

379
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,236
But you'll never be one of us.

380
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,654
And you should know by now
what we do to outsiders.

381
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,531
Viktor, come to toast our new brother?

382
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,863
Yes. Of course.

383
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,449
Congratulations, brother.

384
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,795
What was that about?

385
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,543
That was nothing.

386
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,052
- What is this?
- Best not ask, just drink.

387
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,132
How long are you gonna be staying here,
man?

388
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,939
I'm a fugitive, Rene. I live here.

389
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,977
And until you heal up, we're roomies.

390
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,737
So, you feel much more like talking?

391
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,241
Why don't we talk about the time
you were tortured?

392
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,946
Sure.

393
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,828
It was about a year ago.

394
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,537
My brother, Andy, did it.

395
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,589
- You got tortured by your brother?
- Mmm-hmm.

396
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,167
He was working with Damien Darhk.

397
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,462
Oliver said you re-enlisted. That why?

398
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,343
Partly.

399
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,682
That also why you sidelined yourself?

400
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,925
That too.

401
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,679
- Hmm.
- So, you ex-Navy, right?

402
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,014
- Dishonorably discharged.
- Reason?

403
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,976
You know something, man,
you don't have to tell me.

404
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,527
We were transporting a prisoner,
one who had information we needed.

405
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,497
Intelligence officers
couldn't get it out of him, so...

406
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,785
I tried to do it my way.

407
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,952
You put a beating on him.

408
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,792
I've been thinking a lot
about that decision.

409
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,582
Particularly since you've been on
the other side of that beat-down, right?

410
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,047
Because I screwed up. Again.

411
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,213
That's my life, man.

412
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,929
And now you're asking me
to relive my latest and greatest.

413
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,843
That's right, Rene.

414
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,771
If you wanna help us.

415
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,274
If you wanna give us anything
that can bring down Church,

416
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,900
I'm afraid you're gonna have to.

417
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,327
Okay.

418
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,576
What do I do?

419
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,492
Councilman. Thank you for coming back.

420
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,253
I'm afraid
you're just wasting both of our times.

421
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,127
After you educated
us on Queen Consolidated,

422
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,166
Thea and I thought
we would do some of our own research.

423
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,429
Yeah, we were very curious to find out
where our family's business was located.

424
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,924
You would not believe
how surprised and delighted

425
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,093
we were to find out that
you were one of those, um...

426
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,308
What was...
What was the term the Councilman used?

427
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,972
"Crony capitalists"?

428
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,108
Right. That you were
one of those crony capitalists

429
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,395
who pushed poor people
out of those neighborhoods.

430
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,612
Hiding behind a shell company, of course.

431
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,196
The same company who owns controlling
interest in a real estate developer.

432
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:44,455
Who just filed for permits to redevelop
Orchid Bay for commercial uses.

433
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:49,043
Your opposition to this re-zoning,
it's not political, it's personal.

434
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,748
I get it.
You're trying to protect an investment.

435
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,955
Susan Williams
isn't shadowing you at the moment.

436
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,217
But, to me,
this feels like a story she would like.

437
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,590
So, should I call her?

438
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,797
She actually gave me her number
this morning.

439
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,725
Are you blackmailing me, Mr. Mayor?

440
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:09,810
Well, Councilman, it's like you said.
"Politics is the art of the real."

441
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,449
Well, that was fun.
You made Kullens squirm.

442
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,327
The guy's a career politician. Just need
to know where to apply the pressure.

443
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,787
How are you so sure
about all this?

444
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,788
I'm the mayor of Star City, Thea.
This is what I do.

445
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,789
Thea, get in the car!
Get in the car, get in the car!

446
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:10,158
It's my sad duty to inform you
that at 1:23 a.m.,

447
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:17,541
Mayor Oliver Queen
was pronounced dead at Starling General.

448
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,463
<i>In his too-short life,
Oliver Queen experienced great hardship.</i>

449
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,303
<i>But he came through the other side
with a passion for service,</i>

450
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:32,848
<i>committed to making Star City
a safer place for us all to call home.</i>

451
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,231
Well, he really didn't say anything
that nice about you when you were alive.

452
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,104
Probably didn't deserve it.

453
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,565
Sorry about the suit.

454
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,538
We haven't been properly introduced.

455
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,740
Heads up.

456
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,041
God!

457
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,618
Christopher Chance.

458
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,625
John referred to you as the
"Human Target."

459
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,916
Well, that works better as a job
description than it does as a nickname.

460
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,714
This is so weird.

461
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,924
You have failed this city.

462
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,509
How's Thea?

463
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,804
She's a little shaken. You know,
I didn't get a chance to tell her

464
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,348
what was gonna go down until right before.

465
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,641
She is gonna be so pissed at you.

466
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,147
And, like, the whole city.

467
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,313
They're gonna find out though, right?
I mean, you can't stay dead forever.

468
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,823
No. Just until Church makes his big move.

469
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,108
<i>That's what you're
betting on now,</i>

470
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,824
that the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen is dead.

471
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,116
That's the hope. Now we just need
to figure out what he has planned.

472
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,126
I do not understand you, Oliver.

473
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,037
You become brother,

474
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,583
but you still act like you carry
weight of world on shoulders alone.

475
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,962
That is what your brothers are for.

476
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,135
I'm just thinking about why I came here.

477
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,677
Because this best bar in town.

478
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,062
Actually, only bar.

479
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:02,487
No. No, I mean why I came here.
After Lian Yu.

480
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,987
Yes. Yes, you already told me.
Something about old promise.

481
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,152
I thought I told you,
time to move forward.

482
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,619
She has a family. I haven't...

483
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,916
I haven't spoken to them.

484
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,793
Oh, this is about woman?

485
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,713
Now I understand.

486
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,129
There is old saying in Russian.

487
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,048
Okay, maybe not Russian,
but it still works.

488
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,185
"No problem beautiful woman cannot fix."

489
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,263
Now go talk to her before I do.

490
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,118
Oliver! Where are you going?
Party just start.

491
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,403
Figure I'd get some air.

492
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,870
You sure? I think I heard
Anatoly was looking for you.

493
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,330
I'm sure. I'll be fine.

494
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,627
So, thanks for doing this.

495
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,297
Being killed is basically my job.

496
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,053
But, uh, not just for taking the bullets.

497
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,719
I heard that you got Kullens to cave.

498
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,230
Yeah. And scored you
a very pretty girl's phone number.

499
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,437
I heard that too.

500
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,565
Yeah, but the truth is, you did that.

501
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,280
I was under the impression
that I've been down here all day.

502
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,991
I don't just put on faces, Oliver.

503
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,406
I become my target.

504
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,496
And to do that, I've got to learn
everything there is to know about them.

505
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,078
More than they know about themselves.

506
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,502
- I've got to become them.
- My apologies.

507
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,414
What for? Man, you've got a great life.

508
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,754
You're the mayor.

509
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,132
But you'd still rather
be The Hood than Oliver Queen.

510
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:55,095
Oliver Queen has...
Has never really been my better half.

511
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,386
See, nobody moves forward in life
when they're hiding behind a mask.

512
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,095
Trust me.

513
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,439
You know,
it's why you're struggling as mayor.

514
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,942
And it's probably
why you won't call that girl.

515
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,564
That's not the reason.

516
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,988
Listen, I'm the last person
to give dating advice,

517
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,242
but Felicity moved on. You should too.

518
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,283
You didn't know? Sorry.

519
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:22,618
Uh, earlier today, I met with a detective
who just joined the ACU.

520
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,381
Uh, Billy Malone. He casually mentioned
that he was seeing Felicity.

521
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,333
Seemed to think that you knew.

522
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,500
Hmm.

523
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,633
<i>You're safe, Rene.
Nothing can hurt you.</i>

524
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,473
Is this gonna be one of those hippy-dippy
meditation things?

525
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,982
Eyes closed. Breathe.
Don't try to remember.

526
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,611
Just go there. Get a picture.

527
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:57,203
I was starving. My wrists hurt
like hell from the zip ties.

528
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,533
What else? Sounds? Smells?

529
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,076
Couldn't smell anything. Nose was busted.

530
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,961
<i>What about people? Who else was there?</i>

531
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,749
<i>Muscle. Los Halcones. Triad...</i>

532
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,930
<i>It's not the pain
that breaks people. It's fear.</i>

533
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,308
- But there was something else.
- What?

534
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,763
The Trust goes to the Brace, 04 in 72.

535
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,521
I know what's happening.

536
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,407
- Hey!
- Hi.

537
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,329
Um, thanks for letting me swing by.
I know it's late.

538
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,660
You do remember that this apartment
has a front door, right?

539
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,285
Uh, front doors are more for people
who haven't just faked their own death.

540
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,372
Good point. So, what's up?

541
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,508
Your message sounded cryptic.

542
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,262
Sorry. I wasn't sure
if I should say anything at all, actually.

543
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,551
That couldn't wait till tomorrow?

544
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,258
Why didn't you tell me
that you were seeing someone?

545
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,853
Well, maybe on some
crazy sub-conscious level

546
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,515
I was worried you'd show up on my balcony
in the middle of the night.

547
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,560
Sorry.
Snark probably isn't appropriate here.

548
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,857
I'm totally fine
that you're seeing someone.

549
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,905
But I'm hurt that you didn't tell me.

550
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,156
I'm sorry. I meant to, and then
every time I went to go bring it up,

551
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:24,748
I just sort of...
Like... I just chickened out.

552
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,246
Why? Were you...

553
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,336
Were you
keeping the door open for us, or...

554
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,668
No! Course not.

555
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,254
No, it's just,
you and I work together and I just...

556
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:41,049
I didn't wanna make it a thing, you know,
until it was something real.

557
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,594
Is it real?

558
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,226
I don't know.

559
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,862
It's John and Rene. They have something.

560
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,488
"The Trust goes to the Brace, 04 in 72."

561
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,651
Could that be any more obscure?

562
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,162
"04 in 72," could be the time and date.

563
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,289
4:00 a.m., 72 hours after he held Rene.

564
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,791
Yeah. That's soon.

565
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,951
And "the Brace"
is what the guys in my hood

566
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,496
used to call a private airstrip
outside Pennytown.

567
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,876
Halpin-Brace Airfield?

568
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,633
That's the one. And this "Trust"?

569
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,591
I think it's the heads of the
crime families that Church controls.

570
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,006
That's a bigger leap than
Curtis took at the Beijing Olympics.

571
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,807
When he had me dig my own grave

572
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,388
he talked about bringing this
"Trust" together.

573
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,554
That's his big play, man.

574
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,231
- 04:00 a.m.'s in 20 minutes.
- Mmm-hmm.

575
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,023
Wake up the team. We don't have much time.

576
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,113
You're all geared up.

577
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,738
Oliver didn't bust me out of prison
for me to warm the bench, right?

578
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,076
So, what's up? You ready to move out?

579
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,165
Decided not to go.

580
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,998
Last thing any of you need right now
is me screwing things up again.

581
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,414
When it comes to guilt and recrimination,
the line forms behind me.

582
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,417
I didn't think I was ready to face
what I had done.

583
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,803
But I'm wearing this suit again because
I think it's a path to redemption.

584
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,513
And it could be for you, too.

585
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,564
Good flight?

586
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,150
Everyone's very interested in hearing
what you've got planned, Tobias.

587
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,069
It's called the largest drug enterprise
on the Western Coast.

588
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,204
Shipments 24/7.

589
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:32,539
In a city where cops are afraid
or on our payroll.

590
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:37,047
And as an added bonus,
the Mayor's an alkie.

591
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,751
Sentry reports movement on the perimeter.

592
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,381
I thought you'd taken out the Green Arrow.

593
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,718
Nah, it's not him. It's the JV squad.

594
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,722
Chill out, damn it! Deal with them.

595
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,313
Spartan is such a badass.

596
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,609
The baddest.

597
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,171
You were right.
Fear of pain is what's worst.

598
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,127
You afraid yet, bitch?

599
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,128
Never.

600
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,444
I lost Church.

601
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,783
Got him. Moving southwest.

602
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,038
I've got these two. Go back up Mr. Church.

603
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,594
You guys all right?

604
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,463
Good to see you again, brother.

605
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,803
Yeah, you too. Nice helmet.

606
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,598
Target is secure. You guys all right?

607
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,861
You look like you've seen a ghost.

608
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:30,824
You survived. I guess
I'll just have to kill you again, Oliver.

609
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,659
You mind if I call you Oliver?

610
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,118
Yes, I do.

611
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,830
Get up.

612
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,203
You're done, Church.

613
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:17,374
You got much worse coming,
and you don't even know it.

614
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,917
He calls himself Prometheus,
and he's gonna end you.

615
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,554
First of all, I would like to apologize

616
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,718
for perpetrating
a deception on this scale.

617
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,230
The ACU had intel that we may
be able to catch Mr. Church,

618
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,187
but only if his plan moved forward.

619
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,563
Which would only happen if he believed
the Mayor of Star City was dead.

620
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,825
In my mind, this was a worthwhile gamble.

621
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,783
And it paid off. Mr. Church
and his underlings were apprehended

622
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,368
as well as the heads
of organized crime enterprises

623
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,752
in Blüdhaven, Hub City,
Keystone and White Holland.

624
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,298
One more piece of good news.

625
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,754
I've just received word

626
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,512
that the City Council passed an ordinance
re-zoning for low-income housing.

627
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,140
And with Church in custody,
I take it that your identity is safe?

628
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,896
Well, I hope so. Thanks for the assist.

629
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,474
And the personal insight.

630
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,643
Just part of the service.

631
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,771
Ah, speak of the devil.

632
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,815
Oh, am I the devil now?

633
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,702
That would definitely be my cue to leave.
Take care.

634
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,241
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

635
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,876
It's not like you need an invitation.

636
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,746
Yeah, no, I know. I just...

637
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,256
Just between us,
things have been a bit complicated.

638
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,628
Wait, complicated is probably not
the right word.

639
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,792
It's not the wrong word.

640
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,757
I want you to be happy.

641
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,183
And in the spirit of that,
I think that you owe it to yourself

642
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:02,562
to find out if what you have
with Billy is real.

643
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,015
And I owe it to myself

644
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,152
to embrace whatever's next
for me when I'm not...

645
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,820
- Yes.
- The...

646
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,356
Yeah.

647
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,153
It's funny,
that's what I came here to say to you.

648
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,161
We're usually on the same page.

649
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,414
About a lot of things.

650
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:29,002
All right. Uh, mmm, yes,
I will see you later.

651
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,206
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

652
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,300
- Thank you.
- You don't need to thank me.

653
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,555
Yeah.

654
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,883
I care about you.

655
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,720
And I will always care about you.

656
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,682
It's a mortal lock.

657
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,028
Viktor wanted to give you a proper gift.

658
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,452
Guessing that's not you.

659
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,878
That's a nice knife.
Maybe I keep it after I kill you.

660
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,462
This doesn't concern you.

661
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,717
Actually it does.

662
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,854
Have a nice night?

663
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,358
You can tell your boss I expect
the other half of my fee within the hour.

664
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,327
Oliver, are you okay?

665
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:45,991
I'm fine.
Anatoly, what the hell is going on?

666
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,243
Viktor clearly sent those two to kill me.

667
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,707
Then some other guy shows up
and kills them. And...

668
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,293
Yes, yes. My way
of handling Viktor problem.

669
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,924
I know he wanted you dead.

670
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,210
You didn't think
it would be a good idea to tell me that?

671
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,926
We cannot kill Viktor. He's too connected.

672
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,556
I hire special man.

673
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,177
- Come on.
- Anatoly, what did I get myself into?

674
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,729
Yeah, a most interesting question,
my friend.

675
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,362
I thought we agreed
the last time was the last time, Susan.

676
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,775
I know. But then I remembered
my money was still good,

677
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,410
and you still like
gambling a bit too much.

678
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,113
What do you have for me, Ian?

679
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,787
The guy who took the bullets for
Mayor Queen was Christopher Chance.

680
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,291
It felt like his work.

681
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,202
I think I figured out
how Queen knows him.

682
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,416
Really?

683
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,628
I went through the database
looking for details on Chance's past ops.

684
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,339
Came across this little beauty.

685
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,338
You recognize your boy?

686
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,761
That was taken five years ago.

687
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,890
When Oliver Queen was supposedly
stranded on a deserted island.

688
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,646
Heading northbound.

689
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,108
<i>Those cops riding protection
aren't on your payroll, buddy.</i>

690
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,777
Nobody's breaking you out.

691
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,162
It's not what I'm worried about.

692
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,744
You guys should've flown me
to Iron Heights.

693
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,121
Yeah, I heard you liked helicopters.

694
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,287
What's got you spooked?

695
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,512
All right.

696
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,881
Don't go out there.

697
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,553
Why? So I can protect your ass in here?

698
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,933
So you don't get killed.

699
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:20,813
I knew we'd be having this conversation.
Just hear me out.

700
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:27,072
You want the Green Arrow.
I can give him to you.

701
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,328
I can give you his name.

702
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,832
You would be the only person who knows.

703
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,416
It's Oliver Queen.

704
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,841
So, we cool?

705
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,548
Yeah, we are.
