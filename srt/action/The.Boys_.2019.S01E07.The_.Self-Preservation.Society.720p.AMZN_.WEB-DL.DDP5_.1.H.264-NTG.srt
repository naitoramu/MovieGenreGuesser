1
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:34,947
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,624
Who's been naughty?

3
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,873
- It is dead center on your brand.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,435
- Let's get a picture.
- I love pictures.

5
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:42,709
Hey.

6
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,149
Smile.

7
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,383
Another one.

8
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:05,817
Oi, gorgeous.

9
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,688
- Vodka soda, hold the soda.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,906
Drinks are free,
but the food's bloody awful.

11
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,656
Ahi tartare, for fuck's sakes.

12
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,298
Okay. Just let me shake
a few more hands,

13
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,365
and then we'll be
out of here... whoa.

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,160
Easy, tiger.
I want you on your "A" game.

15
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:21,165
- "A" game?
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,667
You know,
I like the sound of that.

17
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,918
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,499
Merry Christmas.

19
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,506
Becca.

20
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,929
New senior director,
digital marketing.

21
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,888
- Uh, yeah. How did you know?
- I have my sources.

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,680
And your nametag.

23
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,234
Yes, that, too.

24
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,898
- Uh, this is my husband, Billy.
- Great to meet you.

25
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,228
Billy Butcher.

26
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,402
Becca, you handled
my takeover, right?

27
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,242
Y-Yes, I-I did.

28
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,027
- You saw it?
- I loved it.

29
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,321
- U-Uh, wow. Thank you.
- No, thank you.

30
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,176
- What'd you take over?
- Vought's Twitter account.

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,160
- Yeah.
- Your brilliant wife here

32
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,662
did all the work.

33
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,913
She posted my photos,
she wrote my messages.

34
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,456
It was exceptional.

35
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,129
All right, so they thought
it was you up there,

36
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,838
but it was really Becca.

37
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,231
Bit deceptive, isn't it?

38
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,835
Uh, no, Billy, that's what we do

39
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,681
'cause Homelander's busy
saving lives.

40
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,716
It's okay, it's okay.
I-It... you're right.

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,390
It's a little dishonest,

42
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,098
but I'm all thumbs when
it comes to that kind of stuff,

43
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,889
so leave it to the experts.

44
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,483
Listen, I would
love to talk to you

45
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,059
about maybe quarterbacking
the rest of my social media.

46
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,105
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

47
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,688
My dad, he always said,

48
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,573
"Surround yourself with people
smarter than you."

49
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,370
Oh, my, uh, better half is, uh,

50
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,868
wanting my attention, but maybe
we could chat tomorrow.

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,179
That sounds wonderful.
Thank you.

52
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,543
Thank you.
Greet to meet you, pal.

53
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,251
Good to meet you.

54
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,671
Love that accent.

55
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,424
Hello, beautiful.

56
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,014
How the fuck does he walk around

57
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,009
in that sweaty fucking wetsuit
all day long,

58
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,431
- balls mashed up against his leg like pancakes?
- Oh, shh.

59
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,100
- What?
- You promised to behave.

60
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,179
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah?

61
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,434
Yeah.

62
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,909
Hi.

63
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,599
- Huh.
- Hmm.

64
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,981
I didn't realize you were
such a cigar aficionado.

65
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,229
I really, I just...

66
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,402
Mm. I can't get enough
of huge gross logs

67
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,573
of filterless tobacco.

68
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,959
- This is all really nice.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,093
But...

70
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,592
There is a "but" coming.

71
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,224
Okay.

72
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,601
But why did you bring me
to a hotel?

73
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,180
Hmm? And not your place?

74
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,476
Well, you know.
I mean, yeah, sure, my Dad

75
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,031
could make you
some post-coital pizza rolls.

76
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,066
I just figured this would be
slightly less humiliating.

77
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:23,282
Yeah, all right.

78
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,493
Yeah.

79
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,504
Yeah, very convincing.

80
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,787
You okay? What's going on?

81
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,713
It's just...

82
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,170
I've never seen your place,
or your job.

83
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,804
You're kind of a mystery to me.

84
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,642
T-That's hot, right?

85
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,637
Look, you got to understand
that my dad

86
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:52,271
was nothing but corny jokes
and expensive gifts,

87
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:57,191
until he was gone, and all
the money along with him.

88
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,242
I know that
that's not you, but...

89
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,080
I need to know that the hotel
is a nice thing

90
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,747
and not a red flag thing.

91
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,249
I quit my job.

92
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,421
Um, I'm sorry, I-I...

93
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,224
I really should've told you.

94
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:29,347
After Robin, programming
other people's remotes,

95
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,349
it felt kind of pointless.

96
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,653
And yeah, I mean,
you can-you can meet my dad,

97
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,109
but you're gonna
regret asking that.

98
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,910
So everything's okay?

99
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,330
It's great.

100
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,706
No red flags.

101
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,554
Hmm.

102
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,453
Now, I know this is not
as swanky as New York City,

103
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,117
but to have a hero like you in
a place like Sandusky, I mean,

104
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,788
everyone down at the local
branch is just tickled pink.

105
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,658
- Yeah.
- Now, we got Cedar Point,

106
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,286
biggest roller-coaster park
in the whole U.S. of A.

107
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,705
We're just a couple short hours
from Cleveland or Toledo.

108
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,425
And Lake Erie? Right here,

109
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,467
- if you want to swim.
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,350
Ooh. Uh...

111
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,847
There it is.

112
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,559
- What's this?
- That's your per diem.

113
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,389
You get $75 a day.

114
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,484
Grocery store,
right down the street.

115
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,109
To make my own food?

116
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,607
There's a Dairy Queen, too.

117
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,819
Like Blizzards and stuff?

118
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,238
You betcha.

119
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,816
Well...

120
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,111
I mean, what about
my crime itinerary?

121
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,485
I think the best thing's just
to, you know, get out there

122
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,801
and put some points
on the board.

123
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,405
Not much crime in Sandusky.

124
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,332
I mean, we're not a shithole
like Akron.

125
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,580
But if something comes up,
we'll call.

126
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,336
You'll call?

127
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,458
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

128
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,578
- Oh, this is killing me.
- Come on.

129
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,302
Damn.

130
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,297
Oh, no fucking way.

131
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,339
You need 3,000 calories an hour,
or you're gonna pass out.

132
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,755
I can't do this shit, man.

133
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,854
Tough shit.

134
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,639
You heard the doc.

135
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,733
Your heart is getting bigger,
balls are getting smaller,

136
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,479
your bone density's for shit.

137
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,401
That Compound V shit
is killing you.

138
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,959
Hey. Don't even say it out loud,
all right?

139
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,294
You don't know shit about it,
you understand?

140
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,318
I don't want to know.

141
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,491
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

142
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,531
Did you see my last time
out there?

143
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,405
Sioux City's got a fucking
faster runner than me.

144
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,963
Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

145
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,617
Okay? None of that shit.
We train.

146
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,035
Back to the basics.

147
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,963
Nobody gets it back at my age.

148
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,513
I'm gonna be a freak show
like Ben Johnson,

149
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,378
racing against horses.

150
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,595
At least you'll still
be breathing.

151
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,229
Shit.

152
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,477
- I got to go.
- Where?

153
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,410
- What's going on?
- I missed you guys.

154
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,908
Just wanted to see
your smiling faces.

155
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,661
Take a seat, buddy.

156
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:10,002
And, truth be known,
I felt like we were overdue

157
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,585
a little heart-to-heart.

158
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,841
A rap session,
maybe a little tough love.

159
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,144
What's that supposed to mean?

160
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,733
It means that lately,
some of you

161
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,597
have been, eh,
a little out of sorts.

162
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,979
Erratic.

163
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,074
Unreliable.

164
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,030
Downright sloppy.

165
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,032
Not you, Noir.
You've been great.

166
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,584
But the rest of you...

167
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:48,919
It is fair to say
that I am disappointed.

168
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,089
Got to keep your eye
on the ball, guys.

169
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,419
The enemies
are storming the gates.

170
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,684
I mean, we're not even The Seven
anymore, we're down to five.

171
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,178
We're dropping
like fucking flies,

172
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,561
but at least now I know why.

173
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,728
Uh...

174
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,941
Why...

175
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,073
Is this a joke?
Why is Hughie up there?

176
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,700
I don't understand.
Who is this guy?

177
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,156
This guy is Hugh Campbell.

178
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,487
He and Starlight
are going steady.

179
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:26,754
He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

180
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,498
Wait, what?

181
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,000
As well as blackmailing

182
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,961
Mesmer, Ezekiel, Popclaw

183
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,674
- and God knows who else.
- Popclaw?

184
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:39,094
No. No, no, no.
You... That-that is insane.

185
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,684
Starlight, sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

186
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,221
- but words...
- No, sir.

187
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,595
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

188
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,523
It's just, he's not...

189
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,480
I mean, why would he do that?

190
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,193
Good question.
A-Train, over to you.

191
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,204
- What?
- Oh, boy.

192
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:03,067
That little egg of yours
is still scrambled, huh?

193
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,623
How about now?

194
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,501
Oh, shit.

195
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,499
I know this guy.

196
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,144
You did smash
through his girlfriend,

197
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,538
so I should hope so.

198
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,796
Robin s-something or other.

199
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,759
I-I remember now, I-I've seen
him outside of Popclaw's place.

200
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,012
He was all in my face.

201
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,136
- You're fucking this guy?
- S... Okay, slow down.

202
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,024
I don't know what's going on,

203
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,941
but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

204
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,611
Well, that is true, actually.
That's very true.

205
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,741
He is just a man, and,

206
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,858
by the looks of it,
not much of one.

207
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,065
But... but hear me out.

208
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:48,195
W-What if he was helped? Hmm?

209
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,955
Say someone,

210
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,577
I don't know,

211
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,674
got him in to see Ezekiel

212
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,459
and got rid of the Deep.

213
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,804
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

214
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,549
Keep those hands down
by your sides, missy.

215
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,596
Sit down.

216
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,975
Now... I know

217
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,645
that you want to make
this whole Deep thing

218
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,565
an "All the single ladies"
moment.

219
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,373
Power, right?

220
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,197
But really, what you've done

221
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,253
is pulled off
every criminal's wet dream.

222
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,958
I mean, The Seven
is down by two.

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,710
I just can't help noticing
that it all started

224
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,712
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

225
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,545
which one of us is next, hmm?

226
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,092
You bitch.

227
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,255
- I didn't do anything.
- Enough!

228
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,845
We're a different fucking breed.

229
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,480
We shine with the golden light

230
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,307
of providence, but you,
you've been helping these

231
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,734
fucking mud people

232
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,982
- to go against us.
- No.

233
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,236
Shut your fucking mouth,
young lady.

234
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,451
If you were in my position...

235
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,500
...what would you do to you?

236
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,003
Homelander, that's enough.

237
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,042
You got something to add, Maeve?

238
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,339
She didn't know.

239
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,181
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

240
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,097
and her heart's beating
like a little rabbit.

241
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,347
The only thing she's guilty of
is being fucking stupid.

242
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,599
She obviously fell
for this Hugh Campbell guy

243
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,733
and he's pumping her
for information,

244
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,270
so back off, leave her alone.

245
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,363
Wow.

246
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,525
Starlight,

247
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,794
you must be something special.

248
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,616
Hmm?

249
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:57,252
I can't remember the last time
Maeve gave a shit ab...

250
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,880
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

251
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,917
really.

252
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
And if I say no?

253
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,686
Come on.

254
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,807
I got this.

255
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,574
It's you and me,

256
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,897
remember?

257
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,868
Don't say
I never do anything for you.

258
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,616
All right.

259
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,625
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

260
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,998
I just hope
you're right about her,

261
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,045
for both your sakes.

262
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,179
Class dismissed.

263
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,435
Look at this.

264
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,531
Oh, no. You don't stir,

265
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,487
you fold. Like this.

266
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,239
Now that's what
makes them spongy.

267
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,582
Here you go.

268
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,498
She wants to know
where you were.

269
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,673
That's a compelling
fucking question.

270
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,715
Hey, can we talk?

271
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,139
That's what we're doing,
innit?

272
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,927
No, I mean...

273
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,970
There ain't no secrets here,
son. Spit it out.

274
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,425
Stop being an asshole,
just talk to the guy.

275
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,266
Hughie doesn't mind.
Do you, Hughie?

276
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,904
Okay, fine. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

277
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,909
- Do what?
- This.

278
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,368
I mean, Vought,
whatever with Kimiko,

279
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,749
it's-it's awful,
and you got to stop it,

280
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,207
- but I can't.
- Right.

281
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,827
You just want to kick back,
drink a few Mai Tais,

282
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,875
and let us do all the work,
is that it?

283
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,549
You know, I managed to go
my whole life

284
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,981
without seeing someone
die horribly,

285
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,665
and now I'm up to about
a half dozen,

286
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,085
- so I think I'm good.
- Please.

287
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,433
You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

288
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,219
just like the rest of us.

289
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,523
Now, why don't you
stop pissing around

290
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,387
and tell everybody what this
is really all about?

291
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,805
- Yeah?
- Fine.

292
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,484
Annie.

293
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,653
- Fuck.
- Okay?

294
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,570
It's about Annie.

295
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,864
Fucking finally.

296
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,985
He's been sneaking off to
give her one at Lincoln Grand.

297
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,222
- You've been following me?
- Like you gave me a choice.

298
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,916
She doesn't know anything, okay?
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

299
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,100
- All right? We'll just...
- Just what?

300
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,174
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

301
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,630
Maybe pump out a few
flying babies?

302
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,420
No. I... I don't know.

303
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,593
No, you don't know
'cause you ain't thinking,

304
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,222
- except with your dick.
- You're wrong about her.

305
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,350
That bitch is fucking
playing you,

306
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,008
and you're too fucking blind
to see it.

307
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,056
Right, so better to be loyal
to a dead woman

308
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,480
who doesn't know
and doesn't care?

309
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,518
How's that working out for you?

310
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,789
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Hughie.

311
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,754
Long time no talk.

312
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,814
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

313
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,088
Who's this?

314
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,721
I thought you would
recognize my voice.

315
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,887
You spend so much time obsessing
about me, am I right?

316
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,806
- Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
- Oh. H-Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

317
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,950
Why is he here? He says you're
in some kind of trouble.

318
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,184
Dad, are you okay?

319
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,023
Oh, o-okay.

320
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,561
He's fine.
Remington Steele's almost on.

321
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,516
A-Train, listen to me.

322
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,646
Oh, shit, if he's burned,
then I'm fucked.

323
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,074
He's on fucking Medicaid.

324
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,412
He's harmless. Let him go.

325
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,527
My place is burned.
They've got me.

326
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,874
Oh, my God.

327
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,910
Get your ass over here
in 20 minutes,

328
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,123
or I'm gonna burst through him
like a fucking piñata,

329
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,674
do you understand me?
Just like I did your girlfriend.

330
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,038
- Yeah. Got it.
- And, Hughie,

331
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,554
alone. If I catch a whiff,

332
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,007
a whiff of one of your

333
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,837
- little asshole friends...
- I got it.

334
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,180
All my bank accounts are frozen
and flagged. Monique,

335
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,799
listen, when you get this,

336
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,176
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

337
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,328
- Well, I hope she was fucking worth it.
- It's not Annie.

338
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,829
- She doesn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

339
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,193
- I'm gonna fucking do her in.
- The hell you will!

340
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,520
Hey, hold on a second.
She doesn't know. It wasn't her.

341
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,936
She's never seen me before.

342
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,074
Not once, not ever.
So how did I get burned?

343
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,040
Mesmer. You fucking idiots

344
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,697
had to go to Mesmer.

345
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,365
Fuck me.

346
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,634
Thank you.

347
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,339
That was not smart,
to sleep with her.

348
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,521
- Hughie.
- Dad.

349
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,270
He's acting strange.

350
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,772
You know, real jumpy.

351
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,404
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he...

352
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,151
Right here, sport.

353
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,034
Look what I got.

354
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,994
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

355
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,995
What, did they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

356
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,497
Watch out, A-Train's coming.

357
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,960
You were a fan!

358
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,671
You were a fan, and not,
like, a dabbler, no,

359
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,882
you were super fan 99.

360
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,092
Excuse me, sir.

361
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,693
- W-What is this about?
- Shut the fuck up.

362
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,217
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

363
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,761
I came alone.

364
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,965
You let him go.

365
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,017
Alone, huh?

366
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,940
- Wow.
- Ah!

367
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,649
You really did come alone.

368
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,042
Next time... there's not gonna be
a next time, but next time...

369
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,606
have at least
a few cards up your sleeve.

370
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,493
Okay. You mean, um,
you mean, like this?

371
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:10,161
- Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
- W-What is that?

372
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,124
I don't know what that shit is.

373
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,785
Oh, you don't?

374
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,593
So you don't mind if I do this.

375
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,587
- No, fuck!
- What?

376
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,958
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

377
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,125
I have a bigger dose.

378
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,734
I have a real dose
hidden somewhere outside.

379
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,298
Let him go, I hand it over,

380
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,682
then you can do whatever
you want with me.

381
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,430
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

382
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,643
as long as you take it,
you'll be the fastest?

383
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,435
If you try anything,

384
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,156
I can catch up to dear old daddy
in a millisecond.

385
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,027
- Dad, time to go.
- Not without you.

386
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,414
I'll be right behind you.

387
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,050
I am not leaving you
with him, all right.

388
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,497
You're just a kid.
You're my kid.

389
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,786
Dad.

390
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,210
I'll be all right.

391
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,169
I got this.

392
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,963
Go.

393
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,096
All right, where is it?

394
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:14,269
You know, this shit
must be pretty good

395
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,900
if it's worth running through
a human being for.

396
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,148
Oh, my God, man,
that was an accident.

397
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,940
- Where the fuck is the V?
- That accident had a name.

398
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,364
And what about Popclaw?

399
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,072
She had a name, too.

400
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,204
Charlotte!

401
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,832
The only good thing
in my life is gone now.

402
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,370
What is this, man? I kill your
girlfriend and you kill mine?

403
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,794
I didn't kill your girlfriend.

404
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,463
You used her.

405
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,381
You put her in danger,

406
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,259
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

407
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,549
How does this not all start
with you, Hughie?

408
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,473
The only difference
between you and me

409
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:50,932
is that I made a mistake.

410
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,062
The shit that you did
was on purpose.

411
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,099
So who's worse?

412
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,363
You bitch!

413
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,858
You know, you're right.

414
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,649
It would've been stupid
to come alone.

415
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,781
Monique,
it's not safe here anymore.

416
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,025
We got to go.

417
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,576
You swore to me
and to Jesus Christ

418
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,371
that you were done
with Billy Butcher.

419
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,165
I know, I get it.
Everything Butcher touches

420
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,378
- turns to flaming hot shit.
- No, I ain't blaming him.

421
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,169
Last I checked,
you're a grown-ass man.

422
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:27,012
It's my fault, okay?

423
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,219
But we can't do this right now.

424
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,655
- You put us in danger without thinking twice, Marvin.
- Monique, just...

425
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,059
Daddy!

426
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,598
Hey, baby, come here.
Give me a hug. Oh.

427
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,689
- What have you been up to?
- I was drawing you a picture.

428
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,730
You were? Can I see?

429
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,783
Oh, my goodness,
this is beautiful.

430
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,568
Thank you, baby.

431
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,072
Janine, honey, Daddy's gonna
take us on a sleepover.

432
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,834
Can you help Mommy
pack your toys?

433
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,657
- Good girl.
- Baby, we're running late.

434
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,252
We don't have time to pack toys.

435
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,078
We got to go.

436
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,503
I knew you'd vote
your conscience, Senator.

437
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,753
Thank you.

438
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,795
Good-bye.

439
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,762
Three votes to go.

440
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,181
And the B.A. guys

441
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,483
said that the Pentagon
is shelling out

442
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,806
$35 billion on the low end.

443
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,982
- That puts us ahead of Lockheed.
- Amazing.

444
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,993
That's incredible.
Edgar must be thrilled.

445
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,857
Ugh, fuck Edgar.

446
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:34,825
We did this, you and me.
This is about us.

447
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,955
Hey, do you remember
that marketing girl?

448
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,287
Ashley?

449
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,173
Um, I'm sorry,
I-I had to fire her, she...

450
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,880
No. No, no, no.
Seven, eight years ago.

451
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:49,883
Becca.

452
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,974
Becca?

453
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,759
- Yes.
- Becca Butcher.

454
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:54,933
That's it.

455
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,061
Mm-hmm. Yeah, her.

456
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,639
What about her?

457
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,146
Well, she's missing.

458
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,358
What do you mean, missing?

459
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,069
I mean missing, as in missing,

460
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,780
presumed dead.

461
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,530
- Wow.
- Yeah.

462
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,411
I looked at her file, and
the cops think it was suicide.

463
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,579
Mm.

464
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,947
Yeah, it seems her husband...

465
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,785
Well, he got pretty riled up.

466
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,831
William Butcher.

467
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,086
Am I supposed to know his name?

468
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,930
No. Not specifically, but...

469
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:37,177
I was just wondering if you knew
what happened to her.

470
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,431
No, I just assumed
that she quit.

471
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,983
Quit?

472
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:44,687
Is there any particular reason

473
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,189
why you are asking
all of these questions?

474
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,981
No, no. I'm just... curious.

475
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,946
It's interesting, right?
I mean, it's...

476
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,867
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely sad.

477
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,986
Yeah. Yes, very.

478
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,543
You know, I was, I was
thinking that maybe, um,

479
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,710
I could get Maria to stay late
with the baby and...

480
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,260
...maybe we could
order in and...

481
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,509
catch up.
Just me and you.

482
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,774
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

483
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,942
But you go be a mommy.

484
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:40,082
I'm telling you,
you're gonna love it here.

485
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,737
You like roller coasters?

486
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,786
I'm more of a water park guy.

487
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,919
Well, Cedar Point's got both.

488
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,956
Mm-hmm.

489
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,175
You first.

490
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,600
Huh...?

491
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,889
Oh. Well, most girls
like the suit.

492
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:08,354
Well, I'm not most girls.

493
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,856
Mm. Is it true what they say?

494
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,859
Come on, baby.

495
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,451
I got you here in the flesh.

496
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,857
I gotta see it.

497
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,195
Please?

498
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:24,791
I don't, I don't look
like everyone else.

499
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,249
That's what I'm counting on.

500
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,880
All right.

501
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,310
Oh, look at those gills.

502
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:48,638
Oh, my God, that's so fucked up.

503
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:52,686
Hey, can-can...
Can we just, uh...

504
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,981
Ah... be gentle, be gentle.

505
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,145
Ow, it's tender. Oh, God.

506
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:01,704
Okay. That hurts.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

507
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,094
- Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
- Come on, it's just my pinkie.

508
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,698
No, I said it hurt.

509
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,169
All right, look,
I think maybe you should go.

510
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,919
I'm not going anywhere,

511
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,422
you little fucking freak.

512
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:20,585
Lay back.

513
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,604
I said, lay back.

514
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,556
Ah. God. Ow!

515
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,677
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

516
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,305
- Oh, yeah. You like that?
- Ow.

517
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,561
Oh, you little fucking freak.

518
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,185
Oh, you like getting
your fucking gills fingered?

519
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,862
Ow. Oh, God.

520
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,201
Ow, ow. Oh, God.

521
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,639
Having a good growler, are we?

522
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,808
How did you...?

523
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,559
I stuck a little bug on you
back at that shithole of yours.

524
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,573
'Cause, you know, fuck you.

525
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,936
No...

526
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,363
What did you expect me to do?

527
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,991
It was Homelander.

528
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,320
You got to talk to me.

529
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,195
Wait, wait. No. I can help you.

530
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,539
Becca?

531
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,338
Your wife.

532
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,343
'Cause she's missing?

533
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,595
I can help you find her.

534
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,917
Please, I have a daughter!

535
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,539
No!

536
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,816
Don't want none, fuck off.

537
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,860
I'm here about your wife.

538
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,487
I believe this was a few days

539
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,832
after you met Homelander
at that Christmas party?

540
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,418
She was alone with him
for three hours.

541
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,821
Not long after that,
Rebecca went missing

542
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,030
and has remained so ever since.

543
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,241
One way or another, Mr. Butcher,

544
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,331
I believe Homelander
was involved.

545
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,737
Homelander?

546
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,830
But he's a fucking superhero.

547
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,837
You wouldn't believe
what they get up to.

548
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,632
Who the fuck are you?

549
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,510
My name is Mallory.

550
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,596
I'm the person
who can get you payback.

551
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:56,373
Who's calling?

552
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,120
Nobody.

553
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,844
Listen, if you...

554
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,590
if you want to talk,
I suppose we...

555
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,644
No.

556
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,480
But would it kill you
to make me one of those?

557
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,027
You know, I had someone once.

558
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,907
We were gonna get away,
start a family.

559
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,947
So what happened?

560
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,794
Well...

561
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,039
Everyone always asks,

562
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,672
what's our special weakness?

563
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,091
Gamma rays?

564
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,549
Iron daggers?

565
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,140
Some ridiculous, stupid thing?

566
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,756
The truth is,

567
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:03,306
our weakness
is the same as anyone's.

568
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,352
It's people.

569
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,396
The people we care about.

570
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:13,401
So I say, cut them loose.

571
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,615
For your good and for theirs.

572
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:20,117
That way
you're really bulletproof.

573
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,686
What's up, man?

574
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,976
How'd you end up here?

575
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,191
Oh, tell me about it.

576
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,652
Me, too.

577
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,777
What's that?

578
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,822
Oh.

579
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:02,036
Wait, you can't get
in your head about that.

580
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,497
It's really not
that big of a deal.

581
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:06,708
I'm gonna get you out of here.

582
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,958
Just hang tight.

583
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,383
Excuse me, sir.

584
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:18,304
Oh, hey. Can I take one of these
lobsters back with me?

585
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,553
- You got it.
- Thanks.

586
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,774
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no.
Not that one.

587
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:29,812
This one.

588
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,265
Yeah, that's my guy.

589
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,123
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

590
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,871
Larry, please.

591
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,333
I just need a secure place
for a few nights.

592
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,253
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

593
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,292
Putain!

594
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,883
Hi, you've reached Annie.

595
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,685
- I can't come to the phone...
- Oh, damn it.

596
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,556
That's Hughie, baby.

597
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,729
- She looks like you.
- Nah.

598
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,018
She's good-looking, man.

599
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,152
Right, baby?

600
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,079
Mr. Campbell.

601
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,621
Ooh, yeah.

602
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,375
Pleasure to meet you.
Billy Butcher.

603
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,877
Oh, Hugh Campbell.

604
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,760
- You got a hell of a lad there.
- Well, yeah.

605
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,798
He's all mine.

606
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,054
Hello, hello, hello.

607
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:46,385
What have we got here, then, eh?

608
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,181
What's your name, sweetheart?

609
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,015
You can call me Uncle Billy.

610
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,060
He ain't your uncle, honey.

611
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,284
- He ain't nothing to you.
- Monique.

612
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,904
Good to see you.

613
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,253
Hi, you've reached Annie.
I can't come

614
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,289
to the phone right now...

615
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,302
What's she doing?

616
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:23,009
Uh, okay. It's okay.

617
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,011
It's okay.

618
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,865
Does the Oriental girl not talk?

619
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,429
Uh, Asian.

620
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,644
- Yeah.
- You're right. Asian.

621
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,694
And no, I don't think she does.

622
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,613
Dad, I'm really sorry.

623
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,648
I'm sorry about everything.

624
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,402
No, no, no. Don't say sorry. No.

625
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,865
Look at you,
standing up for yourself.

626
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,406
Jings.

627
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,422
Cold feet, huh?

628
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,839
What?

629
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,247
You said Raynor got cold feet.

630
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,915
Yeah, that's what I said.

631
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,473
You know what I think it is?

632
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,757
I think
Raynor's plenty interested,

633
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,351
only she didn't bring you
Homelander's head on a plate,

634
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,558
and you blew
the whole fucking thing up.

635
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,059
How am I doing so far?

636
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,230
No, mate. Way off.

637
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,859
Bullshit, Butcher.

638
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,977
You're so hot for Homelander
right now, Butcher,

639
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,315
you're not gonna let anything
get in your way,

640
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,240
even if it's
your own fucking friends, man.

641
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,740
You promised me
things would be different.

642
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,793
Matter of fact, you swore it.

643
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,786
But this is worse, man.

644
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,209
This is gonna be
Mallory's family all over again,

645
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,498
only this time
it's gonna be my family.

646
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,922
And if something happens
to them, Butcher...

647
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,598
I don't know what happened
with you and Raynor

648
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,059
or how that situation
got fucked up,

649
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,440
but just please call her.

650
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,647
Please.

651
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,663
Yeah.

652
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,829
There you go.

653
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,210
Dr. Vogelbaum.

654
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,923
Surprise.

655
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:26,384
Thought I'd drop in on you.

656
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,344
You look well.

657
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,386
How long's it been, John?

658
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,309
Long enough that
no one calls me John anymore.

659
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,440
Mm.

660
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:42,899
So, what are these? Uh... pets?

661
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,901
No, just breeding them.

662
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,613
German retrievers.

663
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,244
I try not to get
too attached to my subjects.

664
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,583
Hmm. Well, that's true.

665
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,076
Seems retirement suits you.

666
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,998
Between this
and 80-hour weeks at the lab,

667
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,634
I'll take the lab. No contest.

668
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,298
So, you ever, uh...

669
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,643
catch up with any
of the old gang from Vought?

670
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,886
Look, do you mind
if we don't do this?

671
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,892
- Do what?
- This cat and mouse bullshit.

672
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,185
You want to know
about Rebecca Butcher.

673
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,040
You went to Stillwell
about it because you knew

674
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,154
that'd tip over
the first domino.

675
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:26,862
Well, it led to me.

676
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,450
So just ask.

677
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,279
I'll be honest.

678
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,828
Well, that would be a first.

679
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,788
Eight years ago...

680
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,915
Stillwell called me with quite
an interesting challenge.

681
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,719
Rebecca Butcher
had come to her with a...

682
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,680
completely unprecedented
medical condition.

683
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,682
What condition?

684
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,360
She was pregnant.

685
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,437
With your child.

686
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,659
Pregnant?

687
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,489
Wh...

688
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,787
But I thought I couldn't.

689
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,710
So did I.

690
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,789
Apparently, nature is tenacious.

691
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,764
The fetus was developing
unnaturally fast.

692
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,967
We told her we'd deliver
the baby safely

693
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,507
at a secure location,

694
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,140
but she had to sign an NDA.

695
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,677
Couldn't tell anyone.

696
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,101
Not even her husband.

697
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,850
You can imagine the size
of the potential scandal.

698
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,556
No!

699
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,315
No! Pull it out...
Oh, my...

700
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,869
The birth was difficult.

701
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,539
The baby clawed its way
out of her.

702
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,915
The blood loss...
no one could have survived.

703
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,800
She died on the table.

704
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,048
A-And the baby?

705
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,090
Lived all of ten seconds.

706
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:17,014
Drowned in its mother's blood.

707
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,390
Was it a boy?

708
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:25,024
Does it matter?

709
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,062
Why didn't you tell me?

710
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,066
To protect you.

711
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,528
That's always job one
at Vought, isn't it?

712
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,360
Protect our
most profitable asset?

713
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,698
So why are you telling me now?

714
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,754
You don't understand.

715
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,750
The thing about
cross-breeding dogs,

716
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,752
you get the right genes,

717
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,594
you can get a perfect creation.

718
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,129
But it doesn't matter
how perfect they are.

719
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,434
It's not enough.

720
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,469
When I raise subjects
without their mothers,

721
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,892
they become violent.

722
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,600
Aggressive.

723
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,641
Downright hateful.

724
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,066
You should have been raised

725
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,106
in a home with a family
who loved you.

726
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,780
Not in a cold lab with doctors.

727
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,320
And yet, I turned out great.

728
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:21,025
When I think
what it's done to you,

729
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:24,576
and what you can now do
to everyone else...

730
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,552
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,672
I don't want
your fucking apology.

732
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,625
All this is my fault.

733
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,385
What do you want?

734
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,888
What?

735
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,062
What do you want... forgiveness?

736
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,102
Now?

737
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,901
After you raised me
like a fucking lab rat?

738
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,987
No.

739
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,994
Too little, too late.

740
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,329
I don't want anything
from you, John.

741
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,629
I'm just an old man,
thinking about his mistakes.

742
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,638
I'm the world's greatest
superhero.

743
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,642
You're my greatest failure.

744
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,902
Hi. You've reached Annie.

745
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,901
I can't come
to the phone right now, but...

746
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,622
Merde!

747
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,156
Butcher.

748
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,004
- Yeah, yeah, here's a gun.
- Fucking hell.

749
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,669
Calm down.

750
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,248
Okay, come on.

751
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,720
All right, easy, lads. Easy.

752
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,016
M.M.

753
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,927
Deputy Director.

754
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,806
Your family's gonna be okay,
you have my word.

755
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,353
Thank you.

756
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,939
You called?

757
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,526
You are a human after all.

758
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,951
Well, let's not get
too carried away.

759
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,370
Thanks, man.

760
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,408
Come right this way, ma'am.

761
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,417
Monique, I'm sorry.

762
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,539
I never want to see you again,
Marvin.

763
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,800
Come here, baby.

764
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,970
Mmm.

765
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,839
Daddy loves you, okay?

766
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,886
You're gonna be safe with Mommy.

767
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,930
All right? All right.

768
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,187
Take care of yourself.

769
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,235
All right. All right.

770
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,788
- No Homelander.
- No Homelander.

771
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,290
We had a deal.
Everyone else is fair game.

772
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,503
Do you want this or not?

773
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,204
Annie, are you okay?

774
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
I have to see you.

775
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,917
I, uh...

776
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,039
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

777
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,836
You have to explain, Hughie.

778
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,839
You have
to make this make sense.

779
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,721
Just you and me.

780
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,260
You owe me that much.

781
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,766
I'm sorry.

782
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,688
I'm afraid I'm not following.

783
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,557
You and your corporation
are fucked.

784
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:22,855
Unequivocally,
unilaterally fucked.

785
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,700
How was that?
Is that clearer for you?

786
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,741
For the last half century,

787
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,953
you have been feeding
the American people the line

788
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:37,245
that your superheroes
are chosen by God.

789
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,510
I mean, I get it.

790
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,298
Jamming illegal drugs
into babies' arms...

791
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,802
I mean, that doesn't quite
have the same ring,

792
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,724
and that's not even the worst.

793
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,524
What did you do
to this one, and why?

794
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,228
I've never seen her
in my entire life.

795
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,899
Uh-huh.

796
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,107
- What do you want?
- For starters,

797
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,978
there are no superheroes
in the U.S. Armed Forces.

798
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,106
The bill's already gone down
to the floor.

799
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,323
They're gonna vote on it
any day now.

800
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,914
And you're pulling it.

801
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,488
Retooling the concept
for internal development.

802
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,704
I don't give a shit,
but the deal is dead.

803
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,115
And we're gonna go
back to status quo,

804
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,124
where we're the government
and the military,

805
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,666
and you're just assholes
running around in your capes.

806
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,211
- And if we refuse?
- Everything goes public.

807
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,045
Corruption story of the century.

808
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,511
Vought shares go to zero.

809
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,930
The civil suits,
criminal prosecution,

810
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,889
and you go bankrupt,
and your cute

811
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,480
little suit goes to a lovely
shade of orange for 15 to 30.

812
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,604
Ms. Raynor?

813
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,730
Thank you, Michaela.

814
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,993
We're done here.

815
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,701
Everything okay, I hope?

816
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,285
Someone tell me
what the hell is going on.

817
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,711
About 12 minutes ago,
Navy SEALs took out Abu Ressam

818
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,420
about 15 miles
outside of Damascus.

819
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,920
Right, as planned.
So what's the problem?

820
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:09,634
Watch.

821
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,176
We got two.

822
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,180
- Nice eye.
- Stop.

823
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,983
That's our guy. Light him up.

824
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,687
Great.

825
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:24,608
The prick behind Flight 37
is dead. What am I missing?

826
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,937
Just wait.

827
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,411
- Step inside.
- Watch this.

828
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,697
- We got movement!
- Hey! Hey! Get down!

829
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,195
- Hey!
- Get down!

830
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,166
- Get down, motherfucker!
- Don't fucking move!

831
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,576
I said get down!

832
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,085
What the fuck does that say?

833
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,207
"Naqib."

834
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,054
Hey!

835
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,839
Freeze, motherfucker!

836
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:54,143
Kill him!

837
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,034
That's not all.

838
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,001
How is that son of a bitch
still alive?

839
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,458
"Naqib" means "Captain."

840
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,384
We believe it's his...

841
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,422
Supe name.

842
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,813
Are you telling me

843
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,942
they have a Supe terrorist?

844
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,169
Look, Annie, I-I...

845
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,131
Did you kill Translucent?

846
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,006
It's-it's...
it's not that simple.

847
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,388
And you haven't been using me
to get back at A-Train?

848
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,240
Y...

849
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:36,818
You're a murderer.

850
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:38,703
We didn't have a choice.

851
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,079
- There is always a choice.
- Wait.

852
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,787
Aah. What-what are you doing?

853
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,037
- I'm taking you in.
- What... No. Annie, hold on.

854
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,119
To the cops! At least
they'll treat you better

855
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,684
- than The Seven would.
- Just listen to me.

856
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,668
Listen to me, okay?
I know this is so fucked.

857
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,960
You were the only thing, Hughie.

858
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,731
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

859
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,465
I'm still me, Annie.

860
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,887
Please. You know me.

861
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,886
I don't know you.

862
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,598
- Never did.
- If you bring me in,

863
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,309
- I'm dead before sunrise.
- No.

864
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,139
Vought will want to string
you up for a long trial.

865
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,145
Lots of press.
The guy who killed Translucent.

866
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,107
This isn't about Translucent.

867
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:14,358
Okay? This is about Compound V.

868
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,241
Compound V?

869
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,702
It's this drug.

870
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,453
It, um...

871
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,865
It gives the Supes their powers.

872
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,174
Vought will do anything
to cover it up.

873
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,049
N... No. What? Wha...?

874
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,087
What are you talking about?

875
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,893
We're born like this.

876
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:44,637
I'm so sorry.

877
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:48,475
Annie. Annie.

878
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,097
Annie, watch out!

879
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,694
Fucking run, Hughie.

880
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,163
I'm so sorry.

881
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,579
Get the fuck away from her!

882
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,963
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

883
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,538
I didn't ask for your help.

884
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,423
Yeah. Looked like
you had it all under control.
