20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,160
A really quick question.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,410
Do you have a brother?

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,750
Please. No personal questions.
It's one of the first rules, so please...

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,330
So, I have a buddy.
He's... He's like a brother.

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,290
We were in the mine together,

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,160
stole together, in jail together.

26
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,370
And that's the problem, because I'm out,
and he still has five years left.

27
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,120
- Five years, Professor.
- Yes, well, it's just that...

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,160
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what I can do for your...

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,330
for your friend or your brother, whoever.

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,950
No, it's his son.

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,290
- For his son?
- Yes, Juanito. He's my godson.

32
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,290
He's also like a brother to me.

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,700
<font color="#138ce9">MOSCOW:</font> I promised him
when I got out of jail to look after him.

34
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,830
And we haven't seen him in a long time,
and we've just heard he's not doing well.

35
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,450
He's out of work, almost homeless.

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,290
And I thought it'll give him
a fresh start... if we bring him here.

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,700
You think it's better
getting him involved with a heist?

38
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,370
This heist is incredible.

What's wrong?

173
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,450
The museum is big.

174
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,370
And 60, 70 hostages
are difficult to control.

175
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,700
Those numbers could spark a rebellion.

176
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
No.

177
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,790
That would be suicide,
and under those circumstances,

178
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,550
what prevails
is the instinct to stay safe.

179

No.

Fear.

181
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,500
Fear and more fear
will allow them to make poor decisions,

182
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,000
like desperately attacking one of us
even if we're carrying M16s.

183
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,080
- What are you thinking?
- Infiltrate someone.

184

They wouldn't have any direct contact with
us except in case a rebellion breaks out.

185
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,120
And if there aren't any problems,
they'll leave like the other hostages.

186
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,870
It‘s a job that even a smoking monkey
from Ringling Brothers could do.

187
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,200
Maybe even that Juanito guy could do it.

helped him escape from his handcuffs.

- <font color="#138ce9">DENVER:</font> How do you know?
- I saw him gesturing to his thumb.

over to him the entire day.

230
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,050
- You didn't say anything?
- Because I couldn't hear them,

to break his finger.

The plan is where my loyalty lies.
I had to restore the order

It was obvious he would go after her.

my officer in command as his prisoner.

333

Listen. I'm going to give you...
one opportunity to redeem yourself.

Then I'll go back to the hostages.

What should I do?

338
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,160
First, you shut your mouth.

608
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm gonna tell you something.
You're my friend,

609
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,470
- and I respect your girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend.

610
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,540
<font color="#138ce9">DENVER:</font> Who cares?

611
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,790
Ex or not, a friend's girlfriend is like
a radioactive city. Do you understand?

612
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,830
Even after 20,000 years, it's still
contaminated land and you don't enter it,

613
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,550
not even with the blessing of her ex
or your dick in a hazmat suit.

614
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
- <font color="#138ce9">RÍO:</font> That's fucking bullshit.
- No, it's ethics.

615
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,410
It's ethics that should be sacred.

616
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,620
What were you doing
on the couch with Stockholm?

617
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,580
We just were talking.

618
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Barefoot?

619
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,660
Come on, man.

620
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,910
What difference is it
that we were barefoot?

621
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,910
<font color="#138ce9">DENVER:</font> It makes a difference, RÍO.

622
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,040
I wouldn't take my shoes off
and talk to Lisbon on a sofa.

623
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,250
It'd be weird as shit.

624
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,120
And I'd be uncomfortable.
Do you know why?

625
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
That's the territory of the Professor.

626
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,250
Look. It's your boyfriend.

627
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,330
Wanna say hi?

628
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,410
RÍO! RÍO, right?

629
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,330
RÍO! Denver!

630
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,620
Help me! I'm begging you!

631
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,410
I'm tied up in here!

632
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,250
Little friends from the gang,
please help me now!

633
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:41,370
The walls around you are made
of 70 centimeters of reinforced concrete.

634
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,950
It's like screaming on a submarine
in the middle of the sea.

635
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,290
The third card...

636
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,580
I spill blood.

637
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,750
I'm heading out for a bit.

639
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,290
I was telling her about my
post-traumatic stress, moron.

640
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,870
- Shh.
- I wasn't stealing your girlfriend.

641
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,120
Talking to her just calms me down.

642
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,790
- You calm down when you talk to Stockholm?
- Yeah.

643
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,330
She's intelligent, sympathetic.
She listens.

644
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,200
She's kind.
You could talk to her about anything.

645
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,330
You could talk to me too,

646
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,490
but you don't
because you're thinking with your dick!

647
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,290
I haven't been able to sleep for shit.

648
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,450
When I close my eyes,
I have nightmares, anxiety attacks,

649
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,160
tachycardia, sweating, man.

651
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,830
I was only able to sleep
if I knew she was next to me.

652
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,580
Do you understand what I mean?

653
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,500
You're telling me you slept with her
to my face.

654
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,290
I didn't sleep with her, Denver.

655
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,450
She was keeping me company, okay?

656
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,370
Are you my fucking friend or not?

657
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,540
- Yes, I'm your friend.
