And the student
becomes the teacher.

163
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:35,393
You have a point.

164
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:39,063
For me, normal is a world
where only the strong survive.

165
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:42,500
One without simple pleasures.

166
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,903
Thank you, Laurel.

167
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:48,439
I was alone and adrift,

168
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:51,375
and you have
shown me kindness.

169
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,446
I'm only
returning the favor.

170
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:57,348
Isn't that what
you did for Sara?

171
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,851
[Chuckles] There's
little comparison

172
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,988
between my current situation and Sara's
after her time with Oliver on Lian Yu.

173
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:08,759
What's wrong?

174
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,963
It's about Oliver.

175
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,265
There's something
that I haven't told you.

176
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:19,070
He's in Nanda Parbat.

177
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:21,739
I don't understand.

178
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:25,509
He's accepted your father's offer
to become the next Ra's.

179
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:28,646
You should have not
kept that from me.

180
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:30,014
I'm sorry,
it's just--

181
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,716
it's just that
you seemed so happy,

182
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,285
and after what
happened with your father, I...

183
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:41,158
And here comes the Cat-5 prong
into the Ethernet port!

184
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,060
Even if she knew what that was,

185
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:45,062
even if I knew what that was,

186
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:47,765
I think Sara's still a little young
for chicken cacciatore.

187
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,867
Well, my mom used
to feed me nachos from the bar

188
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:52,069
at the Grand  before I was
off the bottle,

189
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:53,108
and I turned out normal.

190
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,934
Ish.

191
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,344
John...

192
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,380
What's the house rule?

193
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:05,983
No Glocks
on the dinner table.

194
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,286
How'd it go
out there tonight?

195
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,154
Your Intel was spot-on.

196
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:12,123
Caught four Halcones
at the docks

197
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,492
trying to unload
a shipment of M16s.

198
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:18,462
Well, I'm especially proud that
you didn't get yourself killed.

199
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,831
That was my
favorite part, too.

200
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:25,102
If you're going to keep
going out into the field,

201
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,338
Do not say
"costume."

202
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,073
Ok.

203
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,375
Identity concealment.

204
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,711
Look, eventually we're going
to have to figure out

205
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,479
a new status quo,
a working one,

206
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,281
now that...

207
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,417
Ollie's gone.

208
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,889
How are you doing?

209
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:48,459
Having never been
resurrected before,

210
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,528
I don't really have anything
to compare it to.

211
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,029
I mean about Oliver.

212
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:53,277
Being gone.

213
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,301
I don't know.

214
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,436
Mornings are the worst.

215
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:02,273
I can't really...
leave the loft,

216
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:05,409
so it's nice to be able
to come here.

217
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,179
You are always welcome
in our home.

218
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:13,451
I just miss him.

219
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:16,053
The fact that he's gone
because of me--

220
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:18,656
He wouldn't want you
blaming yourself.

221
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:23,461
In the military,
they have a saying

222
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:24,795
for a soldier

223
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,164
that makes
the ultimate sacrifice.

224
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,834
Gone...

225
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,435
but never forgotten.

226
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,304
Gone, but never forgotten.

227
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:36,807
[Glass clinking]

228
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,776
[All yelling]

229
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,579
Liling's apartment
is just a few more blocks north.

230
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,618
Wallace said
there wasn't a cure.

231
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,021
[All clamoring]

232
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:52,790
Tatsu: It's United States
Army. Shrieve's men.

233
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,158
That's not a cure
they're giving those people!

234
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,394
It's the virus!

235
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:58,629
Shrieve is leaving
nothing to chance.

236
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,564
He wants to infect
as many people as possible.

237
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,932
Come on, we have
to stop him.

238
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,435
Hey! Get away from there!

239
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:07,338
[All screaming]

240
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:17,648
Tatsu, the truck!

241
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,551
[Gunfire]

242
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,666
I had him!

243
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:38,702
What do we now?

244
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:41,605
Destroy it.
All of it.

245
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:49,180
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Oliver earlier.

246
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,748
That was your right to know.

247
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,316
I just--

248
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,351
things were going
so well for you.

249
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:56,587
You seemed happy,
and I didn't want to upset you,

250
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,957
but I still shouldn't
have kept it from you.

251
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,027
Were I so inclined,
I'd question why your first instinct

252
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,596
is to always keep
matters secret.

253
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:09,133
Even after doing so
cost you a relationship with your father.

254
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:12,336
But I have much
greater concerns.

255
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:13,904
What's going on?

256
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,775
You should go.

257
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,710
No.

258
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,745
I'm not leaving.

259
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:24,682
Friends don't do that
to one another.

260
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:27,485
Now that Oliver
has ascended to his position

261
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:31,455
as heir to the Demon,
he will come for me,

262
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:35,259
with as many men
as it takes to see me dead.

263
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,932
Tonight,
Nyssa al Ghul

264
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,935
faces justice
for her betrayal.

265
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,712
[]Wait a second!
Oliver wouldn't.

266
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:54,147
I don't see how.

267
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,982
I think what
she's trying to say

268
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,684
is that Oliver would never do anything
to hurt you, Felicity.

269
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,420
And the only reason why
he joined the League

270
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,987
is to protect
the people he loves.

271
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,455
Now what you need
to understand

272
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,358
is that Oliver Queen
is dead.

273
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,758
He's a memory.

274
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,828
Apparently, the League
has some of their recruits

275
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,829
undergo a process
of reprogramming.

276
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,564
Like brainwashing?

277
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,933
Oliver never said that he was
signing on for brainwashing.

278
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:16,704
The League's ways are shrouded
in ritual and ceremony.

279
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:18,271
Oliver would not even know
what's happening to him.

280
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:21,474
I don't care!
Oliver, he is stronger than that!

281
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:23,009
I did not come here to debate.

282
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:26,012
Laurel insisted that I bring
this news to you myself,

283
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:29,282
but I can see all I'm doing
is damaging your memory of him.

284
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:33,252
Perhaps it is better for you to not think
of what Oliver has become.

285
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,688
You can have that luxury.

286
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:39,092
Wait, where
are you going?

287
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:42,095
To face him,
and if necessary, my destiny.

288
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:45,598
I will not cower in the shadows
waiting for death.

289
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,839
Great. Now what
are we supposed to do?

290
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,308
Nothing. No offense,
but Nyssa is insane.

291
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,577
Oliver
is still Oliver.

292
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,280
Nobody knows the League
better than Nyssa.

293
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:02,248
And did you see the look on her face?
She was terrified.

294
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,050
I didn't even think
that was possible.

295
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:06,085
Even if Nyssa's
right about Oliver...

296
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:07,720
Which she isn't.

297
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:09,189
Getting between her
and the League isn't an option.

298
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,723
And since when
does Ra's daughter

299
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:13,059
become someone we stick
our necks out for, Laurel?

300
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:14,927
I know you're furious with Ra's
for what he's done to Oliver.

301
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,596
We all are.

302
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:20,333
But Nyssa, she saved
my sister's life.

303
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:22,769
She gave her a home.

304
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:25,171
She's a good person.

305
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:27,807
In spite of everything that
she grew up with.

306
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,842
And the last time
I checked,

307
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,612
protecting good people,
that is what we do.

308
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:34,814
Fine.

309
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:37,684
Nyssa does seem to have an idea
where we can find Oliver and the League.

310
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:40,286
Well, then I guess we shouldn't have
let Nyssa leave alone.

311
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:41,654
No, it's fine.
I just put

312
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:44,323
a tracking device
on her.

313
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,192
This isn't
my first day.

314
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:48,728
[Beeping]

315
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:51,531
[Beeping]

316
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,706
Everybody, get back!

317
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,730
Away from the truck!

318
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:06,245
No more virus.

319
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:08,314
We have to get back to Akio.

320
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,616
Come on.

321
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,288

and then stowing them away
in her quarters.

646
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,279
She would grow to learn

647
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,982
that there is nothing
she can hide from me.

648
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,818
Her exploits of late...

649
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,326
seem to have
clouded that memory.

650
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:05,735
I will remember you
as the warrior you once were

651
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,572
and not as this shell
that stands before me.

652
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,876
All my life, I've lived
in fear of you.

653
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:16,579
But now, as I stand before
you ready to leave this earth,

654
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,015
I want you to know--

655
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,518
I am not afraid.

656
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,956
Do what needs to be
done, my heir.

657
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,858
And take with it
the satisfaction

658
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,327
that your reign
will be unchallenged.

659
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,812
I can see now,
you do not require

660
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,547
a culling to solidify
your reign.

661
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,516
You have broken
your rival, Al Sah-him.

662
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,553
Something I was
unable to do as an heir.

663
00:35:56,555 --> 00:36:00,056
Spilling her blood now
would only serve as gluttony.

664
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,829
Now, perhaps...

665
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,364
her blood could be
of another purpose.

666
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,804
As a means to unite
our families.

667
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:18,775
You as husband...

668
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,910
and you as wife.

669
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,446
I would rather die than
become his betrothed.

670
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,348
Well, your wishes
were no longer my concern

671
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,751
from the moment
you betrayed me.

672
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,789
So you will marry Al Sah-him.

673
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,292
And you will become
bride of the Demon.

674
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,874
[Siren sounding]
[Helicopter]

675
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,309
Oliver: Come on,
come on, come on!

676
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,112
[Man sobbing]

677
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,615
We need a vehicle.

678
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,819
Oliver!

679
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,493
[Starts engine]

680
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,128
Let's get out of this place.

681
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,031
It's ok.
You're safe now.

682
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,808
[Door opens]

683
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,912
Felicity: Thea?

684
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:32,415
The door was open.

685
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,919
Sorry to interrupt
your staring into nothingness.

686
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,656
He should have let me die.

687
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:42,625
That was never
an option.

688
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,531
That's why
I love him.

689
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,034
I didn't know...

690
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:54,037
about you and my brother.

691
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,707
Yeah, well...

692
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,678
It was complicated.

693
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,781
But I did love him.

694
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,851
Despite everything,
I still do.

695
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,356
I do, too.

696
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,525
How...

697
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,894
is that even possible?

698
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,764
After what he's become.

699
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,502
I don't know.

700
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,304
But I think John's right;
I think we have

701
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,206
to remember
the best parts of him,

702
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,042
and we have
to move on.

703
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,144
Are you trying
to convince me

704
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,879
or yourself?

705
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,816
Both of us.

706
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:44,053
I don't know how,
but we have to go on living.

707
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,522
That's what
Oliver...

708
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,258
Ollie would want
for you--

709
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,727
to move on.

710
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,628
To live.

711
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,932
To be with the one that you love
while you still can.

712
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:59,035
Roy is gone, so...

713
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,904
You've had a lot
on your plate,

714
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,375
and I've been trying to think
of the right time

715
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,643
to tell you this...

716
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,247
Roy's alive.

717
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,049
We faked his death.

718
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:16,052
It's a long story,
as most fake death stories are.

719
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,653
We were going to
tell you, I promise.

720
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,322
But then you were busy
being mostly dead,

721
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,867
and then Oliver
signed on to become Darth Oliver.

722
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:21,789
I don't--

723
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:23,813
He's starting...

724
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,096
A new life.

725
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,733
One that hopefully
includes you.

726
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,738
If you want it.

727
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,758
[Sighs]

728
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,710
[Sobbing]

729
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,550
When my daughter
left Nanda Parbat,

730
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:23,019
she absconded something critical
to both our futures.

731
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,754
Do you recall
the village I showed you?

732
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,290
The one where only
the dead remain?

733
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,018
It was your home.

734
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:29,493
Was.

735
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,061
And I was obligated to
unleash death upon it.

736
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,664
It has been this way
ever since there has been a Ra's.

737
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,000
You see, it is
the final act of ascension,

738
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,503
the transformation
to Demon's Head.

739
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,674
The erasure of one's former
life, former home.

740
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:47,009
Now, my predecessor,

741
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,078
he wiped away
Alexandria, Egypt,

742
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,980
with cholera
in 1609.

743
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,816
Today you will
do the same.

744
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,686
Do you recognize this?

745
00:40:56,688 --> 00:41:00,623
The Alpha and Omega
bioweapon.

746
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,558
Beginning
and the end.

747
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,961
Nyssa stole this
to prevent my heir from doing that

748
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,829
which you will
do today.

749
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,666
You will unleash this
on Starling City.

Greg!
Move your head.
