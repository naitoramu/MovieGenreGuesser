He's in love with me.

107

And you know that
because you've seen his diary,

108
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,330
or did he confess it to you in tears,
drinking away his misery?

109
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,610
I've seen how he looks at you.

110
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,580
How he smiles
at every single one of your crazy ideas.

111
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,340
He agrees with everything about your plan,

112
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,330
but he is unable to think critically,
reasonably.

113
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,870
He's in love, and that prevents him
from being objective.

114
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,330
He's completely objective.
He's an engineer.

115
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,160
He calculates complex equations,
and this might surprise you,

116
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,750
but none of those calculations
involve feelings in any kind of way.

117
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,700
You know as well as I do
the plan's disastrous.

118
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,660
The plan is so marvelous.

119
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,910
The plan has some parts,
details that are marvelous,

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
but it doesn't work as a plan.

121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,790
It does not work.

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,750
- Why did you bring me in?
- Because I want to share it with you.

123
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,380
It's the biggest heist of my life,
and I want my brother to be there.

124
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,620
You've called me to come up with the ideas
he's not providing.

125
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,540
And you...

126
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,140
You know how to get the gold out,
but not how to get the gang out.

127
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Also, you don't have any idea
how you'll spend the rest of your lives

128
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,580
with 90 tons of gold on you
without being discovered.

129
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,540
An analytical mind, even a limited one,

130
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,660
would've considered that
before anything else.

131
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750
But not you two.

132
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,660
Because you're in love with the plan,

133
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,250
and he's simply in love with you.

134
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,790
We're guided by passion, true,
but you're blinded by hatred.

135
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,040
Hatred for romanticism.

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,800
Well, maybe that's because
one of the principal themes of romanticism

137
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,200
is suicide. Andres, this plan is suicide.

138
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,660
Still being a pessimist?

139
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,510
It's not his best day,
but he'll get over it.

140
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,500
When he's stressed out,
he gets very negative.

141
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
Well...

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,370
I'm gonna head to the bathroom.

143
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,160
Would you like to accompany me, Sergio?

144
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,950
Have you ever had the privilege
of experiencing

145
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,200
masterful fellatio
from a man with great skill?

146
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,790

- Putting it out.
- Putting it out.

623
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,410
Putting it out.
Not for Spain's credibility.

624
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,750
Not to defend the honesty
of the National Intelligence Agency. No.

Okay, listen up, everyone.

We tried to get out there and deny it...

632
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,200
but that damn Professor
was waiting for us

633
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,620
with the evidence in his hands.

634
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,790
Now the only way out
is by taking the blame.

635
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,620
And who's gonna do that?

636
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,750
For the CNI, Prieto.

637
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,250
For the police, you.

638
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,790
We need you to act as a firewall
so that the institutions come out clean.

639
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,700
What do I do? What do I say?

640
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,080
You want me to tell them
I did it all by myself?

641
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
That it was...

642
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,040
a professional endeavor?

643
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,910
To see if they'd give me a medal
for police merit?

644
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,700
They've got Prieto's e-mails,
so they probably have yours.

645
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,160
You have to confess,
resign from the heist.

646
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,750
And...

647
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,540
take the blame
for all of the illegal acts.

648
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,000
Since I'm going down,

649
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,410
why don't we add stuff
and say I killed Manolete and Kennedy,

650
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,040

651
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,830
I shot the Pope.

652
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,950
Yeah, might as well go for everything, no?

about what you did for us.

655
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,700
I'll have the CNI discredit the evidence.

656
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,660
The state attorney
and the prosecution are on our side.

657
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,450
You'll be put with a judge
who's favorable to you.

658

Someone who owes us.
Someone who we have by the balls.

659
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,310
Granted, you won't get your job back,

660

but don't worry about it

you're getting paid from a reserve fund.

you will not set foot in prison.

the first ones to fall.

673

And why?

674
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,200
Because that's how we'll cripple the tent,

675
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,410
and then, we can protect
all of our people inside of the bank.

to keep control.
