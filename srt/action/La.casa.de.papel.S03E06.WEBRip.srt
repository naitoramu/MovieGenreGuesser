1
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:08,875
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,583
Sergio.

3
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,333
Did you stay up late studying again?

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,583
Come downstairs.

5
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,500
We're waiting for you to eat breakfast.

6
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,833
Tatiana is here.

7
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,041
Good morning.

8
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,708
Prince Hamlet.

9
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,375
May I introduce you to Tatiana?

10
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,750
Hello...

11
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,166
It's a pleasure.

12
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,666
Isn't she the most beautiful woman
in the world?

13
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,250
Really? I didn't know!

14
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,416
What do you do?

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,458
I'm a concert pianist.

16
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,125
Soloist of... classic piano?

17
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,958
Yes, Schumann, Chopin, Bach.

18
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,333
- She has heavenly fingers.
- For piano...

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and for robbery.

20
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,041
Excuse me.

21
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,166
She's a thief and a good one.

22
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,125
Piano and jewels are my two specialties.

23
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,250
By the way, she loves the idea
of the Bank of Spain's robbery.

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,791
She knows.

25
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,750
- She knows?
- Yes.

26
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,708
There are no secrets between us.

27
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,458
Actually, she likes it better
than yours at the Royal Mint.

28
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,916
Can we take a minute to talk...
in private?

29
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,750
Are you crazy?

30
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,833
That may be.

31
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,375
Andrés, what's going to happen

32
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,833
once they offer a million dollar reward
for any information?

33
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,125
With a job like this,
it will surely happen.

34
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,041
- Don't go there.
- What?

35
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,750
You're insinuating that the love
of my life is going to betray me.

36
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,333
I'm not insinuating it, I'm saying it.

37
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,500
But, okay, let's believe in true love...

38
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,291
- Fuck!
- Let's go inside.

39
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,708
You were saying, "Let's believe
in true love," and I say, "Of course."

40
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,708
Yes, let's assume Tatiana
won't sell you out.

41
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,041
Listen to me!

42
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,416
She's a thief.

43
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,765
What if she has to choose between
ratting you out or going to jail?

44
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,416
It's so easy to talk about love
when you've never known it.

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,375
I'm being objective, my perspective
isn't deformed by sentimentality.

46
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,583
Let me tell you something about Tatiana.

47
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,041
I've traveled around Europe opening safes
with her,

48
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,083
and you know robberies are tense affairs.
There is always conflict.

49
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,766
"You didn't place the explosives right."

50
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,583
"Where are the diamond bits?" It's normal
to blame any mistake on the other.

51
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,750
But with her, that doesn't happen.

52
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,958
It doesn't. It's like walking on clouds.

53
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,541
We've spent 14 hours in a stinky basement
to open a hole in the wall.

54
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,166
And we made love
as if there was no tomorrow.

55
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,625
Couples fight when they go to Marbella
on holiday,

56
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,541
we robbed Crédit Agricole and it felt
as if we were on our honeymoon.

57
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,208
You felt the same
the other four times you married.

58
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,666
That was a low blow.

59
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,125
Low and despicable, it doesn't do you
justice as a brother or a man.

60
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,058
- Good morning, Giovanni.
- Good morning.

61
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,458
Good morning.

62
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,101
You allow two monks to get to the kitchen,
and you have the plans on the walls!

63
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,000
Please, they call me Mr. Engineer.

64
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,763
They think we're academics, not robbers.
Why are you so pessimistic?

65
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,125
How long have you known her?
Tatiana. How long?

66
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,291
Why does it matter? Love can't be timed!

67
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,250
Love is to be lived.

68
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,583
No. You can't risk
the whole plan for a woman.

69
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,583
That's the first rule.
Andrés, the first rule:

70
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,666
"The plan can't be poisoned by
an amorous relationship. Never."

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,750
Never.

72
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,375
It's not so difficult to understand.

73
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,833
It's seven p.m. We have to make a call.

74
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,083
Can you call Palermo, please?

75
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,708
Palermo. Situation?

76
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,416
We've already done ten tons.

77
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,708
It's 10,700 kilograms turned into grains.

78
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,208
Two percent more than planned.

79
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,791
Breaking records, Professor.

80
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,250
<i>Like Usain Bolt.</i>

81
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,333
And the defenses?

82
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,208
We're still welding. We have two for now.

83
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,791
<i>Any news?</i>

84
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,708
Everything's in control here. There?

85
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,916
No complications.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Over and out.

87
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,333
Break into the bank. Don't doubt it.

88
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,041
We're evaluating risks.

89
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,958
Luis, look at me.

90
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,875
I have a pill box on my nightstand
with pills of every color.

91
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,625
I feel weird if I am not wearing pajamas.

92
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,458
For two years,
I have had erectile dysfunction

93
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,791
because of those fuckers.

94
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,250
Post-traumatic stress.

95
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,583
What you have to do is stop coming here.

96
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,250
Go with Merche to your hometown,
rest and take care of yourself.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,708
And don't turn the fucking TV on.

98
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,833
Luis, don't make the same mistake I did.

99
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,083
If you have to drop a 20-megaton bomb
on them, you do it!

100
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,583
Just do it!
Don't be afraid of the consequences!

101
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,416
That's better

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,583
than dropping small shitty bombs
every two hours.

103
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,875
Because these fuckers,

104
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,541
if you aren't forceful,
they'll shit all over you.

105
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,583
They can shit on me as long as they want,
as long as they don't reveal state secrets.

106
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,083
If we break into the bank, Alfonso,

107
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,500
we will all end up in court.

108
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,083
Or something worse.

109
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,166
What do we do then?

110
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,875
Should we sit back and watch,
as if we were tied down?

111
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,583
If they have that advantage,
we neutralize it.

112
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,583
Do people know what those secrets are?

113
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,250
No! Not even God knows.

114
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,875
Well, Intelligence knows those secrets.

115
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,541
What paper is used, what stamp.

116
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,875
Wonderful.

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,291
Let's fabricate our own secrets.

118
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,791
Let's contaminate the editorial offices
of all the newspapers and TV networks

119
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,583
in this country,
as the Professor would do.

120
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,208
Sierra, please, what you're...

121
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,166
Superintendents bought by drug dealers,
ministers accepting bribes,

122
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,375
orgies...

123
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,041
paid with the cooperation's funds. All in.

124
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,250
What the fuck are you saying?
Listen to me.

125
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,875
We can't do that,
we would destroy the system's credibility.

126
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,375
Police, politics, institutions...
Everything!

127
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,291
No! The media...

128
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,541
they'll start to verify the information.

129
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,750
And everyone will have an alibi.
Where was whatshisname? In his hometown!

130
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,125
For fuck's sake! Where else?

131
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,000
And the Minister?
In a meeting in Brussels.

132
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,708
And once the Professor, our dear shepherd,

133
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,791
publishes the real state secrets...

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,500
not even God will be able
to tell the lies from the truth.

135
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,083
We would have deactivated
the ace up their sleeve.

136
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,958
And do you know what's best of all?

137
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,000
That by the time he tries to recover,
we'll have gotten in and out of the bank.

138
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,125
That, I swear to you.

139
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,750
DAY 2

140
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,166
Are you all right?

141
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,500
My stomach hurts.

142
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,333
From being shot.

143
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,291
Here.

144
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,000
It's hard, because of the impact.

145
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,791
Poor you.

146
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,208
And I'm constipated.

147
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,791
With this situation, you can imagine.

148
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,791
Of course.

149
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,750
Can you pass me the coffee, please?

150
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,000
Come here.

151
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,291
Me?

152
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,291
Yes, you. Of course. Who else?
Stand up and come here.

153
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,208
Come with me.

154
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,333
I can t believe it!

155
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,291
Go, go!

156
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,958
What the fuck are you doing?

157
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,041
I'm sorry!

158
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,041
Did you try to flirt with that girl
by talking about poop?

159
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,958
I was just saying my tummy aches
because of the gases.

160
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,458
What an idiot!

161
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,291
Okay, okay. Listen to me.

162
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,916
Do you like that girl?

163
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,541
Yes.

164
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,875
- I like her very much.
- Very much.

165
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,833
Very much. Did you think...

166
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,708
that talking about being constipated,

167
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,416
about your fucking bowel obstruction,

168
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,625
was a good way to seduce her?

169
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,125
Listen to me. You have to...

170
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,291
From now on, you're a fucking hero.

171
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,000
A fucking hero. Nothing hurts you.

172
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,142
You are going to give her
your food ration every day.

173
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,625
Every one of them.

174
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,500
And if I get cocky,
you're going stand up to me.

175
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,250
Starting now. Stand up to me.

176
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,291
Stand up to me, fuck!

177
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,375
Yes, sir!

178
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,125
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,041
For what I did.

180
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,791
For shooting you in the vest.
I was having a tough time.

181
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,208
Don't worry, Mr. Denver.

182
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,101
I know these things happen
during robberies.

183
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,916
It isn't easy, Miguel. It isn't.

184
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,866
But let me tell you something.

185
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,875
I know...

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,583
that with my intelligence

187
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,250
and that roguish smile you have,
that tenderness,

188
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,791
you're going to win Amanda over.

189
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,250
Am I right? You are much better up close.

190
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,666
Well, I do what I can, Mr. Denver.

191
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,750
Of course.

192
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,750
Now, go to the toilet

193
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,583
and don't come out
until you're done pooping. Go.

194
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,541
Mr. Denver.

195
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,375
What's up?

196
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,833
If you're there, I can't concentrate.

197
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>We interrupt this program.
The biggest secret filtration</i>

198
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,963
<i>has just happened
in the history of our country.</i>

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,791
<i>This newspaper has had access
to more than 100 classified documents.</i>

200
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,416
<i>Spain sold cluster bombs</i>

201
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,708
<i>to Saddam Hussein six months
before Iraq's invasion.</i>

202
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,291
<i>It's one of the CNI's files.</i>

203
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:04,500
<i>A massive leak of the secrets
that were kept in the Bank of Spain.</i>

204
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,666
- All digital media.
- Those secrets are fake.

205
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,875
They're neutralizing the best bargaining
chip we have to negotiate for Rio.

206
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,958
That's not it.

207
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,791
They're knocking down our shield.
They're going in.

208
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,666
Of course, Mr. Minister.

209
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,250
Gentlemen, we have a green light
from the prime minister.

210
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,333
Formation!

211
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,041
We're going to inject gas
at an extraordinary pressure.

212
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,708
Halothane, highly narcotic.

213
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,041
In 30 minutes,
they should all be unconscious,

214
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,000
but be ready to face any kind of surprise.

215
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,416
Palermo, do you copy me?

216
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,791
<i>I'm listening, Professor.</i>

217
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,416
<i>They're going in. I need you to gather
everyone. I repeat, they're going in.</i>

218
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,750
When? What kind of attack?

219
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,541
I don't know yet. Keep in contact.

220
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,541
Marseilles.

221
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,750
They're going in.
We need to know through where.

222
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,833
Report on any kind of movement.

223
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,166
We need to get off the regional road.
Find another route.

224
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,291
In 300 meters, turn left.

225
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,791
Dirt road.

226
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,875
What's going on?

227
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,125
We passed that car 90 kilometers ago
yesterday.

228
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,267
Are you sure it's the same one?

229
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,791
M5354XX. It's the same!

230
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,041
Don't talk to me like that!

231
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,000
- Not now, please.
- Never!

232
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,875
The antenna, fuck!

233
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,333
Palermo! Palermo, do you copy?

234
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,958
It's stuck. We need to get it out.

235
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,750
Start the car!

236
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,875
No!

237
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,875
Look, Dad!

238
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,083
It's the Professor!

239
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,541
Dad! It's... the Professor! The Professor!

240
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,583
And the Inspector!

241
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,166
Yes, that's right, I'm...

242
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,125
the Professor, and she's...

243
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,708
the Inspector.

244
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,791
Lisbon.

245
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,458
No zeppelins have flown over here.

246
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,458
No.

247
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,250
What? Do you need help to get
the van out of the mud?

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Come on!

249
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,541
Come on, we can do it in a minute!

250
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,833
Come on! Come on!

251
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,416
Come on.
Wait for her to get into the van. Wait.

252
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,375
Come on, let's get into position.

253
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,583
Come on!

254
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,875
Push! Push!

255
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,791
Come on!

256
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,166
We're close!

257
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,500
Come on! Push!

258
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,041
Come on!

259
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,041
Something weird is going on.

260
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,750
I thought they were hostages.

261
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,083
Boy!

262
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,666
Weren't you a hostage?

263
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,041
They hired me, okay?

264
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,291
Now, everyone shut the fuck up!

265
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,041
Ladies and gentlemen, they're coming in.

266
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,916
And we all know what that means.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,666
I would love to have more information.
Sadly, we don't.

268
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,416
So we only have one option left.

269
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,125
To use violence as a dissuasive method.

270
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,625
What?

271
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,708
The first armored car we see,
we will fire at them,

272
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,541
so they will back down.

273
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,500
Is that what the Professor said?

274
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,333
We've lost contact with the Professor.

275
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,375
And I don't know if it's a technical
problem or something worse.

276
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,500
The thing is that we're alone.

277
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,666
And I'm in charge now.

278
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,958
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

279
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,958
We don't know how they'll enter...

280
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,166
or if they'll use armored cars.

281
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,416
Will they lower themselves from
the ceiling or come out of the sewers?

282
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,208
Tell me.

283
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,666
Where the fuck are you going
to launch those missiles?

284
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,041
Did we lose our minds or what?

285
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,833
Guys, fuck, don't.

286
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,083
Our people are out there.

287
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,916
We got in here by throwing money.

288
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,666
Not bombs.

289
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,375
That would never be one
of the Professor's strategies.

290
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,666
He would try to buy time.

291
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,041
So Miss Trigger-Happy
now proposes to buy time. Funny.

292
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,916
Do you know what I think, Tokyo?

293
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,208
What do you think?

294
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:51,166
You know that if we use the anti-tanks,
they won't give you Rio back.

295
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,500
They will burn us with napalm.

296
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,875
What the fuck is up with you?

297
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,166
Come on. Wake up! Fuck!

298
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,416
- I'm sorry.
- No.

299
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,708
We already discussed this, Tokyo.

301
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,791
Love.

302
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,166
I'm sorry for your romance,

303
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,416
but it's time to defend ourselves.

304
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,333
Bogotá.

305
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,750
This one.

306
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,625
There's no time! Hurry up!

307
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,791
- Come on.
- Yes.

308
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:35,000
Stop that nonsense, girl.
Now this is the only friend you have.

309
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,958
- Where is everyone else?
- I think...

310
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,875
This needs a little more oil.

311
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,958
No, don't shoot. Please!

312
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,375
He's from the gang, yes! He is.

313
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,666
Cincinnati is part of the gang.

314
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,625
He didn't kill me!

315
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,750
Don't kill dad!

316
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,250
- Kill policemen.
- No!

317
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,458
It's a guitar. How do you play a guitar?

318
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,625
A guitar!

319
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,166
Yes.

320
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,666
Yes. It's a guitar.

321
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,125
No.

322
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,166
Listen to me.

323
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,875
What you're thinking right now, forget it.

324
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,208
What? Do you read minds?

325
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,708
I don't need to read minds, love.

326
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,291
From the moment we came here,

327
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:43,166
you've been guilt-tripping yourself.

328
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,125
Stop that right now.

329
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,958
You were all so fucking happy.

330
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,333
Swimming in money, and now here you are.

331
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,958
It's normal to give myself a guilt-trip
sometimes, isn't it?

332
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,291
I'm going to tell you one thing.

333
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,708
And you're going to brand it
on your pretty forehead.

334
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,833
You're a free woman.

335
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,166
You're free to go to a party,
you're free to leave an island,

336
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,916
and you're free to leave
the planet if you want.

337
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,916
Understood?

338
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,000
Do you know who fucked it up first?

339
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,708
The Professor.

340
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,750
Yes. One doesn't need
to know you very well

341
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,041
to know you can't stand living
on a desert island.

342
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,000
What are you now? Bin Laden?

343
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,583
Are you? No, you're Tokyo.

344
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,541
And the second one who fucked up was Rio.

345
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,166
He bought the phones.
He couldn't help it and he called you.

346
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,083
But do you know what matters the most?

347
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,666
We aren't here to do you a favor.

348
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,833
Look at this big birthday cake.

349
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,125
We're here because
we're adrenaline junkies.

350
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,666
We're adrenaline junkies!

351
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,833
So stop looking at Cincinnati
as if he is an orphan.

352
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,166
No, stop that, and let's enjoy ourselves!

353
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,000
Because this is a party.

354
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,166
Party time, sister.

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,208
Bravo!

356
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,375
Everyone to the table!

357
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,458
What the fuck is this?

358
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,250
- Artichokes.
- Artichokes?

359
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,416
There wasn't any alfalfa left?

360
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,583
Come on, the monks gave us a lot
of vegetables, so grilled vegetables!

361
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,166
And I'm a vegan, which you always ignore.
Today's my birthday, we're eating vegan.

362
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,000
I ignore it because vegans
are the new Taliban.

363
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,250
- Come on!
- Terrorists!

364
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,500
- What?
- You won't stop until we die of boredom!

365
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,791
Boredom, why?

366
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,000
Everything that's healthy is boring.

367
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,291
Nobody invites their friends over
to eat deliciously cooked artichokes.

368
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,333
Because eating artichokes...

369
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,541
isn't fun.

370
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,916
What's fun is eating lamb with friends

371
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,375
or grilled piglet.

372
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,833
Or gathering 50 friends at a country house
and eat a cow.

373
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,958
That's fun.

374
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,625
I'm sorry for the cow,
but that brings people together.

375
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,916
Meat unites, cows unite
and artichokes...

376
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,916
divide.

377
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,583
Then, I don't know why they say,
"Eat healthy, eat a vegan pussy."

378
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
For you, I can become a vegan, love.

379
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,333
Not even with a ten-foot pole, honey.

380
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,875
Professor.

381
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,166
What probability do we have
of leaving the bank alive?

382
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,958
Right now, I would say...

383
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,958
less than 50 percent.

384
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,166
Then, I want to say something.

385
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,958
Well, I won't say it myself,
but it's practically the same.

386
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,333
<i>Missing your lips</i>

387
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,333
<i>I cried for the first time</i>

388
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,666
<i>And I cursed meeting you</i>

389
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,916
<i>Because I can't stop loving you</i>

390
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,000
<i>I wanted to make you my wife</i>

391
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,208
<i>With no love, I searched for luck</i>

392
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,583
<i>I started to use guns</i>

393
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,375
<i>And fate brought me death</i>

394
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,208
<i>María, my life, my love</i>

395
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,416
<i>I won't ever stop</i>

396
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,666
<i>Loving you</i>

397
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,000
<i>With bullets, I lost you</i>

398
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:53,083
<i>You won't ever see me again</i>

399
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,833
<i>María, my life, my love</i>

400
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,916
<i>I won't ever stop</i>

401
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,916
<i>Loving you</i>

402
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,958
What happened here, Manolo?

403
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,708
As you can see,
the van is stuck in the mud.

404
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,958
Where did you get this van?

405
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,001
I borrowed it from
my cousin Antonio, from Madrid.

406
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,375
It's...

407
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,750
the Professor's.

408
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,083
What are you saying, Perico?

409
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,375
My cousin Antonio is a teacher in Madrid.

410
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,833
Is he?

411
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,125
Juani and I are going
to Portugal in that van.

412
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,291
Seven days.

413
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,375
Please, shut up!

414
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,750
And there, we will eat cod.

415
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,875
This thing is huge.

416
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,041
This is like a house inside, isn't it?

417
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,166
Yes, like a small flat.

418
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,250
- Can I go in?
- No!

419
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:03,333
Look at your boots!
They're dirtier than a cow's ass!

420
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,916
I mean your soles.
You will stain the carpet, man.

421
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,208
Don't worry, man.

422
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Here, done.

423
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,250
A kitchen and all.

424
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,083
A fridge.

425
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,000
What a place!

426
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,291
It's very comfortable.

427
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,708
Teachers make a good living, don't they.

428
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,458
I'm going to buy one like this
once I retire.

429
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,625
- Yes?
- Yes.

430
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,208
I'll get a car to get this out of there.

431
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,708
Thanks, Paco.

432
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:08,791
At your service.

433
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,083
Push!

434
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,500
Wow! Give me a hug, Professor!

435
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,583
<i>Tell me, Marseilles.</i>

436
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:03,875
It's a tank truck.

437
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,916
They're putting tubes through
the ventilation pipes.

438
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>Anything else?</i>

439
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,500
That's all.

440
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,625
Thank you.

441
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,416
Narcotic gas. It's probably halothane.

442
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,208
I know Sierra. She's going to do what
Putin did in the Dubrovka Theater.

443
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,011
How far away are we from
the exchange point?

444
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:23,958
Twelve kilometers.

445
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,333
Hello. Is someone here?

446
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,833
Turn up the volume.

447
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,000
<i>...to prevent a death.</i>

448
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:55,208
<i>As an example, should we use
harsher interrogations techniques</i>

449
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,291
<i>on terrorists? What do you think?</i>

450
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,041
<i>Are their rights being violated?</i>

451
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:02,208
<i>The life of an innocent person
is worth more than a terrorist's.</i>

452
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:05,875
<i>Are you confirming then,
that the police practice torture?</i>

453
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,000
<i>- No, no. I'm only saying...</i>
- Son of a bitch.

454
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,916
Can I go home already?

455
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,208
No, you can't go home.

456
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,666
Your statements are risking
everyone's safety.

457
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,041
You will stay here until you learn
to keep your mouth shut.

458
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,291
Where were you
during the previous robbery?

459
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:29,791
Excuse me.

460
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,416
Because I was there.

461
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,958
Facing the terrorists,
saving the lives of 19 hostages.

462
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,291
You brought me here as an expert.

463
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,916
I may be very wrong,

464
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,375
but I think you realized
you don't know shit and this is...

465
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:46,666
over your head.

466
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,166
Do you know what your problem is?

467
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,791
Your life is shit.

468
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,583
You talk to your followers,
they applaud you,

469
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,875
and all this attention
makes you cum, right?

470
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,291
But when you get home, there's no one.

471
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,416
Your wife left you.

472
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,916
You live in an apartment
full of cardboard boxes.

473
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,333
You eat canned tuna,
and your sons don't want to see you.

474
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,708
And you're obsessed with the kidnapping

475
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:18,875
because it was the only noteworthy moment
of your life, and you miss it.

476
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,625
That's why when you see a camera,
you grab onto it like a baby to a tit.

477
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,458
You couldn't be more pitiful.

478
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,375
Canned tuna, you say?

479
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,083
Actually,

480
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,875
my life is settled.

481
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,750
I go from theater to theater,
filling every seat.

482
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:45,833
I help them to improve their lives.
My book is an international bestseller.

483
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,333
And everyone...

484
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,166
absolutely everyone

485
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,625
in this country considers me a hero.

486
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,875
Canned tuna?

487
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,083
Bold ignorance!

488
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,250
Now, if you excuse me.

489
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,416
No, friend.

490
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,375
You aren't going anywhere.

491
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,916
EMERGENCY

492
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,125
Connected.

493
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Palermo.

494
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,458
Palermo, do you copy?

495
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,000
<i>The toilet's ventilation pipes</i>

496
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,250
may be the only access
they won't control with bombs.

497
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,041
<i>They were installed
and widened 17 months ago.</i>

498
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,083
Even so, it's a narrow passage.

499
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,708
<i>It's 45 by 80 centimeters.</i>

500
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,750
<i>We will check that
the gas is taking effect.</i>

501
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,083
Halothane's concentration, 67 percent.

502
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,750
Gentlemen, we're going in.

503
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,416
This is a high-risk mission.

504
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,791
If they control it,

505
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,083
that pipe is a damn slaughterhouse.

506
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,500
<i>Halothane is a narcotic gas</i>

507
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,184
<i>that makes you fall asleep in ten seconds</i>

508
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,458
<i>when its concentration
in the air is over 50 percent.</i>

509
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:52,125
Colonel, we reached the screen.

510
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,273
It looks like there's someone there.

511
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
He's not moving.

512
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,761
<i>The police broke into the bank
the same way someone enters a nursery.</i>

513
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,666
<i>Five elite agents</i>

514
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,875
<i>and 30 clips full of bullets
to achieve a simple objective.</i>

515
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,166
<i>To slaughter us like lambs.</i>

516
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,666
<i>The truth</i>

517
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,750
<i>is that we earned it.</i>

518
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,875
We will do what Putin would do.

519
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,625
Shoot first...

520
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,875
and ask questions later.

521
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,666
We'll try to avoid that.

522
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,208
Understood?

523
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,208
But in case of doubt, we assume
there can be civilian victims.

524
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,708
Understood?

525
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,166
Yes, sir.

526
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,250
Understood?

527
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,833
Yes, sir!

528
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:41,625
Clear.

529
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,583
Clear.

530
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,791
Clear.

531
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,291
Hostage.

532
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,375
Hostage.

533
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:05,666
Hostage.

534
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Get down!

535
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,208
What the hell?!

536
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,083
On the floor! Take cover! Take cover!

537
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,375
Exit through the left, now!

538
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,458
Let's go!

539
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,083
Barricade!

540
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:55,041
<i>Surviving such an operation is impossible,</i>

541
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,583
<i>but by that time in our lives,</i>

542
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:01,625
<i>we were experts in making sure
nothing was impossible.</i>

543
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,333
Palermo.

544
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,208
10 MINUTES BEFORE

545
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,458
<i>Palermo, do you copy?</i>

546
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,666
<i>They're using narcotic gas.</i>

547
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,916
Professor. It's Tokyo.

548
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,875
Professor, all the entries are blocked.

549
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,708
Let's be sure about their entry route.

550
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,171
They'll wait for the building to be filled
with gas. We have ten minutes.

551
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,791
Change of plans.

552
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,666
Retreat!

553
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,833
<i>To confront them, we only needed oxygen.</i>

554
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,000
<i>And to neutralize them,</i>

555
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,583
<i>we only needed to block their path
so they didn't have a way out.</i>

556
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,916
Smoke!

557
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,666
How are you, Suárez?

558
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,333
Did you see the bars?
They're pretty, right?

559
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,041
It's plastic explosive RDX!

560
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,916
Exactly.

561
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,041
They're more than 40 kilograms
distributed in seven charges.

562
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,708
I imagine I don't need to explain
what would happen

563
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:32,375
if any of you dares to touch
a light beam, do I?

564
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,583
Because this is how this works,

565
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,791
the detonator is connected
to a photoelectric cell,

566
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,000
and if a charge explodes,

567
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,708
the rest of them do as well...

568
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,291
in solidarity.

569
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,208
Is your bomb expert here?

570
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:52,625
Fuck!

571
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,583
Then, I am going to recommend that you

572
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,500
calm down

573
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,416
because you're using up your oxygen,

574
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,208
and you will start breathing halothane.

575
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,458
Therefore,

576
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,458
lie back,

577
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,625
curl up

578
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,625
and kiss each other good night, boys.

579
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,666
Thirty-five minutes incommunicado.

580
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,458
We're preparing a rescue mission.

581
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:21,767
General, we can't do that. They'll riddle
them with bullets through the same hole.

582
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,416
We don't know what happened there.

583
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,166
We know we heard the Browning machine gun
and that there was return fire.

584
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,291
Then, nothing.

585
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,208
It's him.

586
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:49,208
Martínez.

587
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:55,208
<i>Professor?</i>

588
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:03,166
I guess you're wondering what happened
to Inspector Suárez and his four men.

589
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,875
What do you have to say about it?

590
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,875
That his behavior was exemplary.

591
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,791
I would describe the operation as...

592
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:12,916
commendable.

593
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,750
But how would I put it?

594
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,250
There were complications.

595
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:24,416
Don't worry, their health is
in perfect condition, of course.

596
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,291
Actually, we're sending you
a video right now so you can be sure.

597
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,708
Martínez!

598
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,458
I think it's better if you see it.

599
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,291
<i>I'm Inspector Suárez,
head of the Special Operations Team.</i>

600
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,875
<i>We're captives.</i>

601
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,083
<i>But I have to say
we're being treated well.</i>

602
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,666
<i>I beg the authorities</i>

603
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,583
<i>to order a permanent ceasefire.</i>

604
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,250
<i>Very good! Very good!</i>

605
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,916
<i>What's next?</i>

606
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:03,791
<i>Come on!</i>

607
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,500
<i>What's next? Come on!</i>

608
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,500
<i>One morning...</i>

609
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,833
<i>I woke up.</i>

610
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,000
<i>Beautiful, goodbye
Beautiful, goodbye</i>

611
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,625
<i>Beautiful, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye</i>

612
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:24,166
<i>One morning</i>

613
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,208
<i>I woke up</i>

614
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,208
<i>And I found an invader</i>

615
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,583
Very entertaining.

616
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,791
But he's sending it to us,

617
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:35,541
not to the press.

618
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,708
I deduce that the Professor wants

619
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,541
<i>to negotiate.</i>

620
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,125
I see you're a real artist.

621
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,708
I'll offer you something better.

622
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,083
I'll offer you an exit.

623
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,500
The Committee against Torture

624
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,708
of the United Nations has opened
an investigation into the Cortés case.

625
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:55,916
It's a matter of hours

626
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,916
before they send forensic doctors
to interrogate him

627
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,375
and neither you nor the presidency
want that.

628
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,375
Son of a bitch.

629
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,791
Your only solution is to hand over Rio.

630
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,916
I am not going to hand a prisoner over.

631
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,625
The police doesn't hand over thieves.

632
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,166
Yes, of course,
but there's a second reason.

633
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:21,625
Your operation made it quite obvious
that you've already decided to kill us.

634
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,666
But under custody,

635
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,458
you can't eliminate Cortés. However...

636
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,250
inside the bank, in an escape,

637
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,791
in a chase...

638
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
you can.

639
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:41,458
I'm offering the state a better situation
than the current one.

640
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:46,208
I'm saving you from
the huge international ridicule

641
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,333
of spreading the video of
your elite commando singing "Bella Ciao."

642
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,291
Hand him over.

643
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,583
We accept the exchange.

644
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:01,958
Hand him over.

645
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:16,750
I want all the hostages and GEOs.
I need to sell this as a victory.

646
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,083
I will give you 40 hostages
and your elite commando.

647
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,583
You can sell that as a victory.

648
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,291
It's eight p.m.

649
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,375
<i>No.</i>

650
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:30,625
I want light.
We'll make the exchange at eight a.m.

651
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,666
I am not going to get
40 civilians out of there

652
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,458
<i>without knowing what's going on.</i>

653
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,708
Accepted.

654
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,000
Take care of it.

655
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:49,916
Of course.

656
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,250
Martínez!

657
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,125
<i>Tokyo, they've accepted.</i>

658
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,166
Hello.

659
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,083
Did you sleep well?

660
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,750
How long have I been asleep for?

661
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,541
Fourteen hours.

662
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:35,875
I'm very sleepy.

663
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,166
You asked for something to sleep.

664
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,875
And they gave you an elephantine dose.

665
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,208
Don't you remember?

666
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,208
Right.

667
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Come on.

668
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,948
We've to get you all dolled up.
You're going to be on TV.

669
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,458
Let's go.

670
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,125
Come on.

671
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,125
Where are you taking me?

672
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,208
To school.

673
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,666
Do you want me to make you some cereal?

674
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,500
Are you really going to be a mother?

675
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,291
Will you go to your son's school
to ready the kids a story?

676
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,000
Of course.

677
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,833
And we will bring them lollipops to bother
all those sexually frustrated mothers

678
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,875
who say candy's bad for kids.

679
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,708
Alicia.

680
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,125
Your son won't love you.

681
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,791
But you will adore me.

682
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:53,833
Let's go.

683
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,970
Are you going to tell me
where we are going?

684
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,041
To school.

685
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,208
HOSTAGE SWAP AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

686
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,458
<i>And the impossible was there.</i>

687
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,208
<i>We had to make a racket,</i>

688
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,250
<i>but everything seemed insignificant to me
when I saw Rio getting out of the car.</i>

689
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,125
<i>He was alive.</i>

690
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:31,916
<i>Disoriented...</i>

691
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,875
<i>and out of sorts.</i>

692
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:37,666
<i>But he looked so handsome.</i>
