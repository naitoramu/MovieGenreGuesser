1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,159
Well, I'm... I'm conflicted
about this.

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,594
I'm not gonna lie to you.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,479
I'm a police officer,
Duly Sworn.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,951
I don't condone vigilantes
or vigilantism.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,936
Once people start taking the law
into their own hands,

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,997
you're on the road to anarchy.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,920
But there's worse things
out there than anarchy,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,515
and sometimes, as much
as I hate to admit it,

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,556
the police aren't enough
to deal with it all.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,799
Emerald Archer:

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,311
The hood and the rise of
vigilantism.

12
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,598
<i>Look, Star City is
a very dangerous place.</i>

13
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,436
If it wasn't, my brother Tommy
would still be alive,

14
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,910
my mother would still be alive.

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,318
If the police can't
protect the people,

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,960
then the people need to learn
how to protect themselves.

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,239
<i>Vigilantes?</i>

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,315
No, they're... they're hypocrites.

19
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,796
They think that they're
upholding the law,

20
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,314
but they're breaking the law.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,552
They're not heroes.
They're criminals.

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,552
The only difference
between me and them

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,836
is that I'm
smart enough to realize

24
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,310
that the only person
worth looking out for

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,880
is yourself.

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,518
I've lost a lot,
most recently my dad.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,913
<i>The world needs a protector,</i>

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,992
someone to keep it safe.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,232
And it doesn't matter
if someone's wearing a mask.

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,720
All that matters
is no one should

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,439
have to lose their family

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,438
or anyone they love.

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,992
<i>Villains
or vigilantes?</i>

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,152
<i>Criminals or heroes?</i>

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,520
<i>From Star City to Central City
to Gotham City,</i>

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,990
<i>Americans have debated
this question.</i>

37
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,800
<i>Do the ends justify the means?</i>

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,951
<i>Does the law have to be broken</i>

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,514
<i>to uphold it?</i>

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,392
- Whoa. Did you get that?
- Go! Go! Go...

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,472
Hey! Hey, you're
not supposed to be here!

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,040
<i>In December 2018,</i>

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,336
<i>the Star City police department</i>

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,238
<i>answered that question
definitively</i>

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,119
<i>when they officially deputized
Oliver Queen,</i>

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,317
<i>the vigilante known as
the Green Arrow.</i>

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,517
Drop the gun, Max!

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,399
Sin, Voice-Over: <i>I knew them
back in the day.</i>

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,514
Canary, the Arrow,
the whole crew.

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Honestly, I don't know

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,919
where I'd be right now
without them.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,550
They helped me out of
a couple pretty tight spots.

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,359
I owe them a lot.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,390
But I, uh, I saw the toll
that it took on them.

55
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,473
Like, people like
to debate about the legalities,

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,000
but for the people
wearing the masks,

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,112
it's... It's not
philosophical, it's real.

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,757
And it takes everything
from them.

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,672
<i>It absolutely
takes a toll.</i>

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,513
I have been doing this
in Star City

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,080
for a really long time,
you know?

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,356
Nearly... nearly 7 years,
but before that,

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,716
i... I was running
all around the world

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,589
<i>with a hood on, trying to make
things right, and...</i>

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,789
Now my life has...
it's never been better.

66
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,599
<i>I'm... I'm...</i>

67
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,195
<i>I don't have to wear
a mask anymore.</i>

68
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
And that really makes
all the difference.

69
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm... I'm doing what I think
I'm supposed to be doing

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,593
in the light of day.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,795
And if I could've, I would've
done it this way from the start.

72
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,792
Surprise.

73
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,998
Hey. One minute, please?

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,391
Hey. Hey. Come here.

75
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,239
Hey, buddy. Hey.

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,913
Kiddo,
how are you?

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
I think I've grown
out of "kiddo."

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
Yeah. OK.
All right.

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,630
Well,
who gave you permission to grow so tall?

80
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
My god.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,376
You must be so excited
to be done... midterms.

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,120
You finally come home
and relax, you know...

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,793
What's this?

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,076
Oh, right.
Uh, Ms. Pedowitz

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,799
is doing a documentary
on vigilantes,

86
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,473
and the SCPD
and I thought

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,392
it might be a way to, uh,

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,631
improve public opinion
on the work I'm doing.

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,880
I've
been collecting

90
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,513
interviews for years
and, frankly,

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,796
I couldn't get the funding
I needed to finish it

92
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,314
until your dad
went public.

93
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,456
Well, the timing
is perfect.

94
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,896
I mean, what with
you working with the SCPD

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,560
and, you know, um, heh,
full transparency.

96
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,320
But this isn't gonna
be in the film, right?

97
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
We can...

98
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,720
we need all of
this edited out.

99
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,036
I don't want my
son on camera.

100
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,636
Oh, uh, OK.
Guys, cut, please.

101
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,279
OK. Mark.

102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,576
<i>You know, I kind of
hate the word "vigilante."</i>

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,034
<i>It just feels like</i>

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,874
such a... Disrespectful term.

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,189
Call them what they are... heroes.

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,951
What? Oliver Queen?
No, that's ridiculous.

107
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,216
Look, first of all, Oliver Queen

108
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,879
doesn't even know Adam Hunt.

109
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,416
And even if he did, what do you
think he did...

110
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,033
slip out of his own
welcome home party

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,156
to become Robin Hood?

112
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,389
I missed tequila!

113
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,956
Ha ha!
No, look,

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,509
you don't become successful
in my line of work

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,035
without being really good
at sizing people up.

116
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,591
Trust me.
Oliver Queen is no one's hero.

117
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,078
Obviously, this particular
comment didn't age too well.

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,113
Truth is, Oliver is not
the same man he was 7 years ago.

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,238
<i>He's changed, grown</i>

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,075
not just as a hero
but as a person.

121
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,296
You really expect me
to believe you're the Arrow?

122
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,356
I am the Arrow.

123
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,035
Oliver Queen
isn't the Arrow.

124
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,716
Quentin, Voice-Over:
<i>Heh! OK, I'll bite. Why?</i>

125
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,315
Because
Starling City needs

126
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,113
what you
can't give it...

127
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,995
Hope.

128
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,117
<i>Well,
he fights for justice,</i>

129
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,395
<i>and he cares about the city,</i>

130
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,200
which is no different than
any other officer here,

131
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,600
as far as I'm concerned.

132
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,159
He just dresses in green leather

133
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,436
and runs around
with a bow and Arrow.

134
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,518
Which sounded a lot better
in my head.

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,798
Can we, uh, can we...
can we do that again?

136
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,296
There have been two murders in the
past week that strike me as odd.

137
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,800
Throats slit
on both of them.

138
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,216
We should cross-reference
the victimology

139
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,276
with any open cases.

140
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,840
Way ahead of you.

141
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,350
Uh, working for the police
is different.

142
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,160
I always thought I was
gonna work on my own,

143
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,712
or that was the plan...
"my crusade is my crusade."

144
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,360
But, you know, life doesn't
work out that way.

145
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,159
Next thing I know,
I'm leading a team.

146
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,518
I'm not...
I'm not entirely sure

147
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,353
I'm meant to be a leader.

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,232
Made a lot of mistakes.

149
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,296
Here they come.
Rolling.

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,720
Shots fired
at the parking garage

151
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,836
on nutter and winter.

152
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,196
Possible vigilante
sighting.

153
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,115
And vigilantes are still
illegal in Star City.

154
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,992
Captain Drake,
are we clear?

155
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,958
Clear. Establish
a perimeter.

156
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Is this a false report?

157
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,431
I think it's more
that we're just too late.

158
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,435
Go.

159
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,840
Rene...

160
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,000
I need a bus at
nutter and winter!

161
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,315
Officer down!

162
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,914
They respond
faster that way.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,912
Medics are on the way,
buddy. It's gonna be OK.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,673
I'm fine.
I got a vest on.

165
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,496
Just got the wind knocked out of me.
But they took...

166
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,599
Who'd they take?

167
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,036
The new Green Arrow.

168
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,713
Who's he talking about?

169
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,480
I don't know.
Just stay on them.

170
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,273
Hey, turn that off...

171
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,512
I told you to turn
those cameras off.

172
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,399
You promised me
full access.

173
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,120
Hey! Keep rolling.
Follow him.

174
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,797
What do you think
you were doing out there?

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,314
Same thing
you do.

176
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm doing good,
by the way.

177
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,675
Thank you
for asking.

178
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,910
I'm glad you're OK.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,496
I'm glad the FBI made
your immunity permanent,

180
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,796
but being a vigilante
is illegal in Star City.

181
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,394
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

182
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,234
I mean, you have a cute,
shiny new badge.

183
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,073
Thought about giving
one to anyone else?

184
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,096
First step would probably
be not being so reckless.

185
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,520
- You or me?
- Try to guess.

186
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,516
I nearly lost my job
giving Oliver a badge,

187
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,696
and Pollard is still looking
for ways to take it from him.

188
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,336
You said they took
the new Green Arrow.

189
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,591
What happened out there?

190
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,918
We were handling
a routine drug bust.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry, Rene.

192
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,296
Are you still working with
the new Green Arrow?

193
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,816
Because I'm pretty sure
we've been over this.

194
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,832
Not for nothing,
but crime stats

195
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,240
have skyrocketed
ever since

196
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,754
we've hung up
our masks,

197
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,150
and they've gone down
ever since nga showed up.

198
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,320
Oh, we need
to come up with

199
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
a better name immediately.

200
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,240
OK. Who was it who
attacked you guys?

201
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,391
Another mask,
some sort of exosuit.

202
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,709
Looked military.

203
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,856
All right,
we need a full

204
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,376
forensics sweep
of the abduction point.

205
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,357
I need to know
where they could've gone.

206
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,070
On it.

207
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,109
What is this circus?

208
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,793
Public relations.
Oliver thought...

209
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,496
I don't mean them.
I mean what I've been hearing

210
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,193
about a vigilante being
abducted tonight.

211
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,999
I thought you didn't
care about vigilantes.

212
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,160
Believe me, captain Drake,
I'm anything but Sanguine,

213
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,237
but your little stunt of
deputizing Oliver Queen

214
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,595
has set off
a firestorm.

215
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,040
That's funny. I think that's
actually a different superhero.

216
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
You're doing your
damage control.

217
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,510
I'm doing mine.

218
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,751
I'm holding a town hall
on vigilantism.

219
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,876
In the hope
that firestorm

220
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,394
will burn Oliver,
get him to resign?

221
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,073
Your friend Oliver,

222
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,056
he's gonna have to stand in
front of the city he lied to,

223
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,276
a city that's afraid
of him, and justify

224
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,352
his continued existence
as the Green Arrow.

225
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,590
You can't force him to.

226
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,718
Oh, I'm the mayor.
I'm pretty sure I can.

227
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,839
You guys get all that?

228
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,479
- Take it off.
- What?

229
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,438
The worm or virus

230
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,318
or trojan horse you
put on my tablet.

231
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Take it off
right now.

232
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,576
I didn't put
anything on your...

233
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
I found
a firewall breach

234
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,594
with a Bluetooth
incursion.

235
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,239
It had to be you.

236
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,597
OK! Whoa.

237
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,909
I programmed a virus

238
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,720
so that it would infect anything
that tried to log on to our wifi

239
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,836
for security purposes.

240
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
It wasn't personal.

241
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,952
Take it off
right now.

242
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,272
OK. Whoa. What is
going on with you?

243
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,096
I haven't seen anybody
this unhappy to be home

244
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,395
since I had to go
back to Vegas

245
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,517
after my first year
of mit.

246
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,799
I'm just pissed
about my tablet.

247
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,950
You were pissed
a long time

248
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,720
before you found my virus,
which is for your protection, by the way.

249
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,116
Really good job
on finding it. I mean...

250
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,230
- Do you want to talk?
- No.

251
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,959
That wasn't so much
a suggestion

252
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,840
as it was more one of those
"mom" things where

253
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,600
if you don't talk now,
you're grounded. So...

254
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,959
Why didn't you let me come
home for Christmas break?

255
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,350
Oh, will...

256
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,835
Trust me, things here were
very complicated.

257
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,519
I was the only kid
left at school,

258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,353
and then when
I come back here,

259
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,397
dad's in the middle
of making some movie.

260
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,039
It's a documentary. It's...

261
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be happy to be home.

262
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,237
We're so happy
that you're home.

263
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,232
We missed you.

264
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
Then you shouldn't
have sent me away.

265
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,953
That is not fair.

266
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,191
Yeah. Neither is
getting shipped off

267
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,794
to boarding school.

268
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,640
John.

269
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,949
Hey.

270
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,551
Felicity's having trouble
locating the new Green Arrow

271
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,200
using surveillance and
keyhole satellite technology,

272
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,158
but I think we both know

273
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,656
A.R.G.U.S. has satellites
off the books.

274
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,360
Oliver, you come in
here with guns blazing,

275
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,376
asking for satellite access
you shouldn't even know about!

276
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,313
I'm simply asking if I can
have your help on this one.

277
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,040
Well, Oliver, yes, but, look,
I need a little bit more information.

278
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,296
I'm quite sure you're
not this animated

279
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,755
because this missing
Green Arrow copied your hood.

280
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,036
She was abducted, John,
and I need to find her.

281
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,190
How do you know
he's a her?

282
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,673
Because she's
my sister.

283
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,034
Thea?

284
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,194
I have another sister.

285
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,232
My mother wasn't the only
one who had an affair.

286
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,039
Who'd have known
that wearing a hood

287
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
and carrying a bow and Arrow
runs in a gene pool?

288
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,840
Look, will you... will you
please help me find her?

289
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,434
Of course I will.

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,153
But I have to ask...

291
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,336
how long have you
known about this?

292
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,510
- A month.
- A month.

293
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,716
I didn't keep it
from you.

294
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,797
I don't
do that anymore.

295
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,136
I mean, you have to admit,
we haven't exactly been running

296
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,560
in the same
Circles lately.

297
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,072
Lately. Lately's been
nearly a year, Oliver.

298
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
But I get it.

299
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,596
We have not been looped in.

300
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,239
But, look,
you should know something.

301
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,516
You rang, boss?

302
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,478
I did.
Oliver needs access

303
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,074
to the black watch
satellites.

304
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,675
Is he supposed to know about those?
You know about those?

305
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,630
You've met my wife,
right, Curtis?

306
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Great point.

307
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
Uh, what are we
looking for?

308
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,315
Not what. Who.

309
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,319
Area's clear.

310
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,096
You sure
this is the place?

311
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,918
It's been closed
over a year.

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,536
Curtis saw movement off
the black watch satellites

313
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,359
at the new Green Arrow's
last location.

314
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,398
Her name is Emiko.

315
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,832
Sounds like you two
have had a conversation.

316
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,832
It's not going
too well so far.

317
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,196
My father
abandoned her.

318
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,953
My mother didn't
help any.

319
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,554
Still, shows
a lot of respect

320
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,632
for her to put on
your hood and quiver.

321
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,440
Not quite sure why
she's done that.

322
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,671
Looks like someone's
been fixing up the place.

323
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,200
Oliver.

324
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,352
Looks like Rory Regan's...

325
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,397
And Rene's.

326
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,513
John, that's Helena's.

327
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,473
And this is Emiko's.

328
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,916
What the hell is
this guy doing?

329
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,512
He's hunting vigilantes.

330
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,240
I've been on more than
one side of the law.

331
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,677
<i>I was a vigilante, and now
I'm the district attorney.</i>

332
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,513
So, I think it's
pretty safe to say

333
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,355
that I'm qualified to talk about
whether vigilantes can operate

334
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,909
within the bounds of the law.

335
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,515
They can't.
They shouldn't.

336
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,150
I know that. And guess what?
They know it, too.

337
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,880
Because if what they were
doing was right,

338
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,638
they wouldn't hide
behind a mask.

339
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,160
<i>Yeah, and I stopped
hiding behind a mask.</i>

340
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,711
But I didn't
stop doing good because

341
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,877
people need help.

342
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,234
<i>It's just that simple.</i>

343
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,909
Is that all?

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,789
<i>I keep going out there
because I love my city</i>

345
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,712
<i>and I'd do anything to help it.</i>

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,390
To me, I'm risking more

347
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,790
sitting on my hands
doing nothing,

348
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,792
just letting the world
get worse.

349
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,394
<i>Yeah, the mayor,
the politicians.</i>

350
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,800
<i>They might care about the city,</i>

351
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,440
<i>but they don't seem to give a
crap about the people in it.</i>

352
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,234
So, are you really so surprised

353
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,789
when people decide
to do something about it?

354
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,036
<i>Um, Oliver's
a complicated person.</i>

355
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,514
You know, we haven't always
seen eye to eye.

356
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,993
He's no Saint.

357
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,193
But he doesn't have to be

358
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,398
for what he does,
for what he is.

359
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,354
That's a hero.

360
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,275
So it looks like I'm
the director, right?

361
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
That's awesome.

362
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,837
I didn't just... I...
I messed it up? Sorry.

363
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,038
Oliver is
an interesting guy. Um...

364
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,273
Unbelievably damaged.

365
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,432
I hope he won't mind me
saying that.

366
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,154
I don't mean... well, all I meant
by that was just that he's...

367
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,836
He's lived through
a lot of darkness.

368
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,355
And all he really cares
about is trying to make sure

369
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,150
nobody else has to go
through what he's gone through.

370
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,630
No, no, no. I didn't know
he was the Green Arrow

371
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,677
until he turned himself in.
I mean, and...

372
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,950
You know.

373
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,475
Whoa, obviously,
big surprise.

374
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,916
I mean, you think you
know a guy.

375
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,195
And bingo
was his name-o.

376
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,999
I found chimera.

377
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
Chimera?

378
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,056
Yeah. Chimera. We gotta
call him something.

379
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,336
I thought "chimera"
sounded cool.

380
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,670
OK, do I look
like Cisco?

381
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,433
Uh, who are they?

382
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,920
Curtis!

383
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,435
I need you to focus.
How'd you find the target?

384
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
What? Oh, yeah,
uh, sorry.

385
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,760
I managed to track it
using the security footage

386
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,433
from that abandoned
athletic club.

387
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,176
After that, I was able
to pinpoint the trajectory

388
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,793
using the black watch
satellites,

389
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,992
which I never said,
because they don't exist.

390
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,833
OK. Where was
he headed, Curtis?

391
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,576
101 federal street. It's an abandoned
building. Probably a secondary lair.

392
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,114
101 federal?

393
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,680
Yeah. Why?

394
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,151
It used to be
Adam Hunt's building.

395
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,920
Who's Adam Hunt?

396
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,232
You know,
either way, suit up!

397
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,976
They're already
suited up, though.

398
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,719
Hurry up.
Get this, get this.

399
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,077
OK, yeah. Huh!
Not anymore.

400
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,510
It's a big building.
He could be anywhere.

401
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,496
Let's start from
the top, work our way down.

402
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,512
You really shouldn't
be in here with us.

403
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,034
He's right.

404
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,793
The guy we're going
after is dangerous.

405
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,296
We knew what we were
getting ourselves into

406
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,959
when we agreed
to this.

407
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,315
Suit yourself.

408
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,957
What the hell is that?

409
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,320
Get them
out of here!

410
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,516
Keep looking
for her!

411
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,616
Go, go, go! Get down,
get down, get down, get down!

412
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,313
OK, just go.

413
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,551
Aah! Uh!

414
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,353
Get out of here now!

415
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,514
You all right?

416
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,758
Yeah. I knew
you had my back.

417
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,194
<i>Oliver!</i>

418
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,915
Look...

419
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,434
She's hurt bad.

420
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,194
It's OK.
You're gonna be OK.

421
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,710
He's... he's coming.

422
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,837
He's coming
for you, Oliver.

423
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,637
Hey, hey. You hungry?

424
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,120
We've still got
half a pizza left,

425
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,395
and somebody's
gotta eat it.

426
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,914
- Thanks, dad.
- Of course.

427
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,315
Who's that?

428
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,631
It's probably your
aunt Dinah

429
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,831
coming here to lecture me
about something.

430
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,754
I swear, she treats me
like a kid or something.

431
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,194
Well, if you just
listen to her.

432
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,920
If you take her side,
I take back that pizza.

433
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,919
Hi. Is Zoe home?

434
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,796
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

435
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,879
I didn't know you
were back in town.

436
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,792
Just for a few days.

437
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,760
Your folks know
you're here?

438
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,399
I'm not 7.

439
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,836
Hey, will. Dad,
I totally forgot.

440
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,718
I texted will about
my geography homework.

441
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,314
He said he'd come
over to help.

442
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,993
Is it OK if we work
in the living room?

443
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,470
I didn't realize
that you two were...

444
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,755
ahem... you know.

445
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,109
Friends?

446
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah.

447
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,794
Felicity set up
an encryption scheme

448
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,176
so I could text Zoe
while I was away.

449
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,656
I didn't know that.
Why didn't I know that?

450
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,736
How come you didn't
tell me?

451
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,080
It's just texting, dad.

452
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,436
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure, yeah.

453
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,632
Um, you guys can have
the living room.

454
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,189
I'll be in
the next room...

455
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,715
Cleaning my gun.

456
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,395
Don't worry about him.
How's it being back home?

457
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,960
Sucks.

458
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,033
Guys with cameras are following
my dad and Felicity everywhere.

459
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,629
And that's
what's bothering you?

460
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,714
We've only got
about 3 minutes

461
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,560
before my dad finds
an excuse to check on us.

462
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,150
What's wrong?

463
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,296
You tell some girl
you have a crush on her

464
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,640
and she didn't
like you back?

465
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,154
Sort of.

466
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,391
Cool. What's her name?

467
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,312
It's not that.

468
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,914
Then what is it?

469
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,554
I don't know.

470
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,794
I think you do know.

471
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,200
You just don't want
to tell me.

472
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,714
Maybe it's not
the worst thing.

473
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,470
My dad and aunt Dinah
fight instead of talk.

474
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,633
Promise me we'll
never be like that.

475
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,235
You got it.

476
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,199
Mind if I hang here
for a few hours?

477
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,118
I really do not
want to go back home.

478
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,516
OK. We should probably
open that geography book.

479
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,954
Yeah.

480
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,794
Get up. Go.

481
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,997
What's that mean,
"he's coming for you"?

482
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,309
Well,
this chimera...

483
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,576
I'm really glad that
name's catching on.

484
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,115
Hey, he's
hunting vigilantes.

485
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,557
So he's like
an anti-vigilante vigilante.

486
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,296
More like a predator
or a lion trying

487
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,437
to take down the biggest
in the jungle.

488
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,874
That's quite a leap.

489
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,656
Tell that to Rene,
who was nearly cut in half,

490
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,275
had it not been for the kevlar,
or Rory or Helena,

491
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,113
neither of which we can
get in contact with.

492
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,669
Oliver and I came across
this collection of masks

493
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,275
in chimera's
underground lair.

494
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,119
He had them all
on display,

495
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,520
almost like
trophies.

496
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,599
Any word?

497
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,195
Best guess is that
she has a concussion

498
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,509
and a couple of
broken ribs.

499
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,196
They're having Dr. Schwartz
examine her discreetly.

500
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,112
Did she give you
any intel on chimera?

501
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,475
Is that what
we're calling it?

502
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,314
I can only hope. I mean,
it'd be nice. Heh! Ahem.

503
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,278
No, she was
in too much pain to speak.

504
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,874
- Meanwhile.
- Meanwhile...

505
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,314
You're next on
chimera's list.

506
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,959
So I can't think of
a worse idea

507
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,396
than going out as Green Arrow
during Pollard's town hall.

508
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,016
Except maybe showing up
in the first place.

509
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,696
Maybe you should tell Pollard
that you're not coming.

510
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,951
I think that's Dinah's job.

511
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,114
Great.

512
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,035
Excuse me.
Uh, where is she?

513
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
What?

514
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,080
Your green-hooded friend.
She's not in her room.

515
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,389
Oh, for god's sakes.

516
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,790
Well, did we really expect
her to stick around?

517
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
No.

518
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,950
It's just me.

519
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,156
What are you doing here?

520
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,233
Captain Drake told me you
bailed at the hospital.

521
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,755
I just came to
check up on you.

522
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,958
- Let me help you with that.
- I can manage on my own.

523
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,191
You are so stubborn.

524
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,875
You sure you and
Oliver aren't related?

525
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,313
Actually, we are.

526
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,880
He's my half-brother.

527
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,478
Ha ha! That's funny.

528
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,517
I'm not joking.

529
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,193
Robert Queen was my father.

530
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,114
So when you told me
about your mother,

531
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,956
you kind of left out a
pretty important detail.

532
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,509
Robert was out of
the picture long before.

533
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,192
I didn't want to
tell you

534
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,239
because I didn't want
to risk changing things.

535
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,277
Changing
what things?

536
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,193
You and me working together.

537
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,753
Why would it?

538
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,514
Oliver's got his thing,
and we've got our thing.

539
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,720
Right?

540
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,911
Yeah, we do.

541
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,400
All right. All right.
Thank you, Ms. Mayor...

542
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
For nothing.

543
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,200
We have a new problem.

544
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,158
Don't we always?

545
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,114
Dinah, before
we get to that,

546
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,920
there's something that I need
to speak with you about,

547
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,674
something I've been
keeping from you.

548
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,635
Well, that is par for
the course with you, Oliver.

549
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,757
That's a fair point.

550
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,550
In this instance,

551
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,552
I just... I needed
some time

552
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,552
to process
the information

553
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,074
before I shared it
with everyone.

554
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,355
What information?

555
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,318
The new Green Arrow
is my half-sister.

556
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,273
She's the product of an
affair that my father had.

557
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,033
Wow.

558
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,555
Ha ha!
I wasn't expecting that.

559
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,994
I really hope you
can appreciate

560
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,514
why I needed
some time with this.

561
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,875
Sure. Yeah.

562
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,679
I have lots of questions.

563
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,200
I have a lot of
questions, too.

564
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,112
I have been trying
to connect with her,

565
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,830
but she is
not very trusting

566
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
at the moment.

567
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,394
Sounds like
your sister, all right.

568
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,079
OK, what's
our new problem?

569
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,198
Right. Pollard is insisting you
go to the town hall tonight.

570
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,158
What? You explained
to her...

571
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
yeah, of course I did.

572
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,056
But she actually thinks
that we made up chimera

573
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,390
as an excuse to get you
to not face the city.

574
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,518
If I had a problem being scrutinized,
Dinah,

575
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,751
I wouldn't let a camera
crew follow me around.

576
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,399
I know. I explained
that to her.

577
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,790
But if you ask me,
she sees this town hall

578
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,314
as a chance to
publicly crucify you,

579
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,754
and she's not
gonna miss that.

580
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,274
I'm not exposing
hundreds of people

581
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,829
to what could potentially
become a war zone.

582
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,400
Pollard cannot
force me to.

583
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,995
- I will tell her.
- Thank you.

584
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,560
Mm-hmm. This should be fun.

585
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,875
Hey. You got a minute?

586
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,360
Of course.

587
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,696
I know you don't plan on doing this
town hall meeting thing, do you?

588
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,916
I just told Dinah to
tell Pollard that.

589
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,160
I'm thinking maybe
you should.

590
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,896
It might be our only shot
at catching chimera.

591
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,960
Curtis will
find him again.

592
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,096
Yeah, well, the trail's
gone cold.

593
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,318
But, Oliver, I have a plan.

594
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,074
I'm all ears.

595
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,759
So are they.

596
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,271
Sorry, guys.
Private party.

597
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,679
Ugh. Damn it.

598
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,629
I enjoyed that.

599
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,951
You know I know what
you're gonna say, right?

600
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
I do.

601
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,716
Best way to stop chimera
is by drawing him out?

602
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,433
Exactly.

603
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,992
Not with hundreds of
people there, John.

604
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,958
This guy's taken
down 4 vigilantes.

605
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,952
He is out of
the SCPD's league.

606
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,394
Yes, he is...

607
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,235
But not Team Arrow's.

608
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,913
What? No. No.

609
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,117
There's no world
in which Pollard

610
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,351
will allow Dinah to
deputize all of you.

611
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,936
And I'm certainly not going
to risk you going to prison

612
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,553
for violating
the anti-vigilante law.

613
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,475
Come on.
Even if I was willing to take that risk,

614
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,438
there is
no Team Arrow anymore.

615
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,795
But there is.

616
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,234
Oliver, there is.

617
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,039
It's just changed.

618
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,920
We may not have been Team Arrow
when you were in slabside,

619
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,196
but we had
each other's backs.

620
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,078
Just give us a chance,
man, to have yours.

621
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,435
You could
go to prison.

622
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,749
So?

623
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,638
You did it for us,

624
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,556
which never really
sat right with me.

625
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,560
And the reason why is because
it wasn't right, Oliver.

626
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,791
We have fights, disagreements,
recriminations,

627
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,918
but it doesn't matter
because we are a team.

628
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,911
And nothing's going
to change that.

629
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,719
John, I made a lot
of mistakes.

630
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,473
We all did.

631
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,274
That's why they're
called mistakes, Oliver.

632
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,278
You learn from them.
You move forward.

633
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,999
We...

634
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,114
We get better.

635
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,200
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen,</i>

636
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,597
<i>welcome to our town hall
discussion on vigilantism.</i>

637
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,239
<i>We're about to get started.
Please take your seats.</i>

638
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,216
Thank you for coming.

639
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,152
You made it pretty clear
I didn't have a choice.

640
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,310
Well, it's my hope

641
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,039
that once the
pittson pavilion opens,

642
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,396
your services will
no longer be required.

643
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,040
The police can keep this
event and the city safe.

644
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,520
The SCPD
has been rebuilt

645
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,592
into a remarkable
police force,

646
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,776
but if they were
enough, the city

647
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,120
wouldn't need me,
now, would they?

648
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,640
It doesn't need you.

649
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,713
That's exactly the message
I intend to convey tonight.

650
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,594
Mayor Pollard.

651
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,056
All right, buckle up, kiddies,
because overwatch is back in the house.

652
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,514
Well, not actually
in the house.

653
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,856
I mean, I'm working at A.R.G.U.S. remotely,
but I'm on the comms, you know.

654
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,176
We know what
you meant, overwatch.

655
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,475
Cool, cool, cool.
So I am tapped

656
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,200
into the Venue's CCTV,
and I am very proud of this one,

657
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,475
The Documentary
Crew's wifi,

658
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,119
so everything
they see, I see.

659
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,112
Copy that. Standing by.

660
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
I swore I'd never
wear this suit again.

661
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,315
Come on. It's got to feel good
to be back in the saddle.

662
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,760
I just wish Dinah
was here with us.

663
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,473
She's doing
her thing with SCPD.

664
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,711
That anti-vigilante law's
crap, man.

665
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,911
No argument from me.

666
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,320
Let's do this!

667
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,232
Over the past 7 years,
Star City has suffered

668
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,551
through a weapon
of mass destruction,

669
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,752
an actual army of soldiers,
and nuclear weapons...

670
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,116
what happened 7 years
ago, I wonder.

671
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,510
Now, Mayor Pollard, I
fail to see your point.

672
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
7 years ago,

673
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,149
you started zip-lining
through the city.

674
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,960
Your activities as the hood
and then the Green Arrow

675
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,351
prompted the very same dangers that
you claim to have saved us from.

676
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,320
Everyone clear out of here!

677
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,816
<i>All units,
all units, report to...</i>

678
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Come on! Let's go!

679
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,633
Let's go. Let's go.

680
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,710
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

681
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,557
Too bad you don't wear
the mask anymore,

682
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,279
but I'll settle
for the hood.

683
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,713
You want a mask?

684
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,836
Here's 3.

685
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,479
OK, I'm analyzing the armor.

686
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,392
It's Wayne enterprises,
military grade.

687
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,392
I'm just figuring out
how to disable it.

688
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,197
Get as many of these people
out of here as you can.

689
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,509
What about you?

690
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,313
He wants a vigilante?

691
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,959
I'm gonna give him one.

692
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,878
OK, good news, bad news
time, guys.

693
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,917
The suit is powered by
an exolithium cell.

694
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,196
He can't move without it.
The only problem is...

695
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,394
It's electromagnetic
shielded,

696
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,040
which means you can't
disable it remotely.

697
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
All good.

698
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,516
Oliver, Dinah,
team's in position.

699
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
We've got this.

700
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,716
<i>On your call.</i>

701
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,836
Now!

702
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,798
Uh!

703
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,355
Dinah!

704
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,589
Whoo!

705
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,713
Please tell me
you got this.

706
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,076
Scpd! Don't move!
Freeze!

707
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,276
What the hell is this?

708
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,016
Maybe you all were too
busy being unconscious,

709
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,872
but we just saved
everyone in here.

710
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,917
Illegally.

711
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,912
The anti-vigilante
law stands.

712
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,398
My hands are tied.

713
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Your honor...

714
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,711
I'm sorry.
The law is the law.

715
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,951
The mayor can't
make exceptions.

716
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,750
Take them into custody.

717
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,878
His name's
Kevin Meltzer,

718
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,600
recently released from
roth psychiatric hospital.

719
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Imagine that.

720
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,680
Apparently,
the hood saved his life 7 years ago,

721
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,991
and he's been obsessed with
vigilantes ever since.

722
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,355
So he just attacks them.

723
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,318
Says he just wanted
the masks.

724
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,040
Fans have a strange way of
showing their affection.

725
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,156
Where are the others?

726
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,311
Interrogation room.

727
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,514
We're not all
on board with this.

728
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Yeah, that's cute.

729
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,876
Hey, get that camera
out of my face

730
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,997
before I give you
an enema with it.

731
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,314
Well, this is
another fine mess

732
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,096
you all have managed
to get yourselves into.

733
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,395
We were
aware of the risk.

734
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,709
All of us.

735
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,120
I think I know
the answer to this,

736
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,496
but is there any way
for us to avoid

737
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,590
sharing Oliver's old cell?

738
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
As the district attorney,

739
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,353
I can decline
to press charges.

740
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Great.

741
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
But by going out
tonight,

742
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,273
we violated the avl.

743
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,555
Not so great.

744
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,195
We don't have a lot
of good options here.

745
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,999
I'm sorry.

746
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,600
I'm sorry.

747
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,640
I never should have let all of
you go out there with me tonight.

748
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,236
You didn't
let us do anything.

749
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,635
It was the right
thing to do.

750
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,359
In more ways
than one, Oliver.

751
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,840
It felt good.

752
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,152
It felt right,
like being heroes.

753
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,359
Being a team...

754
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,511
Even if it was
for the last time.

755
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,314
<i>Disarmed.</i>

756
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,592
Hey, kiddo, what's up?

757
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,157
I saw what happened
on the news.

758
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Where's dad?

759
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,199
Oh, he just came across
a very unexpected...

760
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,840
completely expected
setback.

761
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,115
But he will be fine.

762
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,274
It's actually... You
I'm worried about.

763
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,591
- I told you...
- that you've been lying to me.

764
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,360
I went to go check your
midterm results online,

765
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,353
and I came across
a very convincing

766
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,592
and very fake version
of your school's website.

767
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,716
Felicity...

768
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,400
and I didn't come across
any test results

769
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,272
because you didn't
take the exams.

770
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Why?

771
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,120
Because I got
expelled.

772
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
What's this?

773
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,279
My resignation.

774
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,829
I won't captain a department
that arrests my friends.

775
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,231
I made you captain because I believe in you,
Dinah.

776
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,596
And yesterday I learned you've
been lying to me all along.

777
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,274
Oh, it's a party.

778
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,194
To what do I owe
the pleasure, Mr. Queen?

779
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,193
After speaking with my family,
I'm here to turn myself in.

780
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,256
If you're gonna send
my friends to prison,

781
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,794
you're gonna have to
send me, too.

782
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,752
That's funny because
captain Drake

783
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,476
just stopped by
to offer her resignation.

784
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,958
Your team really
sticks together, huh?

785
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,119
Yes, we do.

786
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,277
I had no idea you
were one of them.

787
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,718
Black canary, huh?

788
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,916
That's right.

789
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,196
And I suppose because
you saved my life,

790
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,636
it's supposed to
melt my cold heart,

791
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,951
but I wouldn't go
that far, exactly.

792
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,513
Well, how
far would you go?

793
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,637
The anti-vigilante law
is still in effect,

794
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,794
but the district attorney's office will
not be pressing charges on your friends.

795
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,432
And tomorrow,
you will issue one of these to each of them.

796
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,359
They'll each be deputized
like Mr. Queen.

797
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,718
So you're changing
your mind?

798
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,757
I am absolutely not.

799
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,275
Like I said,
I believe in you.

800
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,116
I respect results.

801
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,989
And as much as it
pains me to admit it,

802
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,496
we couldn't have made it
through yesterday

803
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,160
without the help
of vigilantes.

804
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,599
Consider this your chance
to prove me right.

805
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,992
Just watch your step,
please, guys.

806
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,117
There's still glass
on the ground.

807
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,197
That was awesome.

808
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,192
What happened here?

809
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,639
Ricardo Diaz and his crew
happened here.

810
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,790
They couldn't stop us.

811
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,192
We're coming back here.

812
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,758
We'll rebuild.

813
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,116
Gonna do it better
this time.

814
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,399
<i>Sounds like you have
regrets about how you did it before.</i>

815
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,711
<i>Too many to name.</i>

816
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,080
<i>A friend of mine
recently told me</i>

817
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,436
<i>that's why they're
called mistakes.</i>

818
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,790
<i>You learn from them,</i>

819
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,196
<i>move forward...</i>

820
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,953
<i>Be better.</i>

821
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,000
Where did you get that?

822
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,150
I stole it.

823
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,560
Yeah, Mia,
that much I figured,

824
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,996
but wasn't this
documentary banned?

825
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,675
I thought every copy
was destroyed years ago.

826
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,353
Not this one.

827
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,831
It's total
pro-vigilante garbage,

828
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,912
but even garbage
can be useful.

829
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,912
Useful for what?
A break-In?

830
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,070
You know what?

831
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,336
Actually, the less I know
about that, the better.

832
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,434
Trust me, Connor.
You are going to want to come with.

833
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,354
So you found this place
by watching that documentary?

834
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,736
Oliver told them not
to reveal the location,

835
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,353
but there's always
clues.

836
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,830
God. It's dusty down here.

837
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,120
Yeah, well,
that's what happens

838
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,674
when a place sits
empty for a while.

839
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,040
Whoa.

840
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,550
OK, this is actually
pretty amazing.

841
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,869
It almost feels haunted.

842
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,553
It probably is.

843
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,792
Vigilantes were
the death of Star City.

844
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,475
And they got exactly
what they deserved.

845
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,394
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
