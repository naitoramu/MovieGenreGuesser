1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,459
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,628
Star City needs the Green Arrow.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,205
So I'd like it to be you.

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,917
<i>The nerve damage in my arm
spread to my back.</i>

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,924
<i>And because of the steroid use,
I caused permanent damage.</i>

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,848
As soon as you're healed up,
I want you to put that hood back on.

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,221
I've been good
for the past two months, good,

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,635
but instead of
giving me back the hood,

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,061
you've had Cisco make me a new suit.

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,021
Ricardo Diaz is pushing Vertigo.

11
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,814
I checked for any
Vertigo-related cases.

12
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,858
They've all been kicked
by Captain Hill.

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,186
She did it for Diaz?

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,406
The Orchid Bay night market

15
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,830
runs three blocks,
east, west, along R-U-L-O.

16
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,498
About midway down there's an alley.

17
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,917
And that's where Anatoly Knyazev
has been making his drop.

18
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,119
He is not a physical threat,

19
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,545
but the two men
who will be with him are.

20
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,793
I've been to this market.
Lot of civilians there.

21
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,169
Hopefully not in the alley.

22
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,002
We're going to pin him in,
take him out, clean and fast.

23
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,294
Any questions?

24
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,597
This group's a little light
to take on three Bratvas.

25
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,016
Well, Diaz has God knows how much
of the force under his control,

26
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,343
including Captain Hill.

27
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,304
Only cops I'm sure I can trust
are here in this van.

28
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,731
Still, it'd be nice
to have some backup.

29
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,850
We're covered. Trust me.

30
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,778
All right. Two minutes out.

31
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,358
Let's get ready.

32
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,576
Tango's heading into the alley.

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,660
<i>Move in.</i>

34
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,508
Looks clean, so far.

35
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,135
Overwatch, any surprises?

36
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,299
Tricky, tricky, Anatoly.

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,382
Thermal reads four bogeys,
east alley.

38
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,262
- I'll flank left.
- I'll take right.

39
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,602
Okay, good. Now that we are alone,

40
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,851
I know this might not
exactly be the right time...

41
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,603
You understand that
I'm gonna be punching people

42
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,979
in about 60 seconds, right?

43
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,776
Yes, but it's been about a week
since you decided

44
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,024
that you're not giving
John the hood back,

45
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,104
and I was just wondering
when you were planning

46
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,188
on talking to him about that?

47
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,117
I'm waiting for the right moment.
That moment is not now.

48
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,069
That's a fair point.

49
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,912
Should try apples. It's good season.

50
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,747
SCPD.

51
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,665
Easy.

52
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,142
You are under arrest for possession
and attempt to distribute.

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,636
Miss Drake.

54
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,220
Cuff him.

55
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,522
I see your face.

56
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,729
Maybe not so good for you.

57
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,812
Load him up.

58
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,541
Toss the three stooges
into lockup for processing.

59
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,543
I want Knyazev in interrogation.

60
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,124
What's goin' on here?

61
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,630
We just got Diaz's right-hand man.

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,710
Incredible, huh?

63
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,088
Why wasn't I informed?

64
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,764
That was my fault, Captain.

65
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,091
I authorized the operation.

66
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,847
I figured you wouldn't mind
given the stakes.

67
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,520
And we also took the liberty
of calling in DA Armand

68
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,722
to expedite the charges.

69
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,982
There's no sense in waiting, right?

70
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,185
Guess not.

71
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,316
Good work, Lieutenant.

72
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,360
Thank you for letting John and I
backstock you tonight.

73
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,992
'Cause you think we couldn't have
stopped Anatoly otherwise?

74
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,743
Because I appreciate the trust.

75
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,200
Well, try necessity.

76
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,500
Curtis is busy watching Zoe,

77
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,873
while Rene is in the hospital
nursing the wounds you gave him.

78
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,421
Yeah, I told him to stay down.

79
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,873
Matter of fact,
I gave him every chance.

80
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,254
You guys made a move
on our team in the field.

81
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,926
These things
are in the past, all right.

82
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,128
Tonight is a good night.

83
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,092
Where's Anatoly?

84
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,266
Interrogation.

85
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,390
Can you buy me
a few minutes with him?

86
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,347
Thank you.

87
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,281
Oh, how nice.

88
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,192
You've come to visit.

89
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,861
Came to see you locked up.

90
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,993
Enjoy it...

91
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,366
While you can.

92
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,168
I know all about Captain Hill

93
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,128
and crooked cops on the force.

94
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,418
You think this is
just your police force?

95
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,598
This is your city, <i>kapiushon.</i>

96
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,885
Your entire city.

97
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,472
Diaz has people everywhere.

98
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,686
All levels of government.

99
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,977
We got a problem.

100
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,315
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,

101
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,322
but Mr. Knyazev wasn't arrested
pursuant to an arrest warrant.

102
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,862
That's crap. You know it.

103
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,369
You're really gonna kick this case
on a technicality?

104
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,542
I'm not bringing charges
that will only get dismissed

105
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,494
the first time they end up
in front of a judge.

106
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,796
You have made exceptions before, Sam.

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,291
You're gonna draw the line now?

108
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,083
On this case?

109
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,794
You're under indictment, Mr. Mayor.

110
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,012
Do you really wanna add a civil suit

111
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,760
for wrongful imprisonment
on top of that?

112
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,475
Cut Knyazev and his friends loose.

113
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,395
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.

114
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,893
What the hell just happened here?

115
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,565
It seems pretty obvious to me.

116
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,394
It's not just Hill
who's working for Diaz.

117
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,405
He's got Armand too.

118
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,904
So Diaz has the police captain,
the DA and...

119
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,485
Other members
of the city's infrastructure.

120
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,911
Anatoly wasn't specific,

121
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,705
he just said that Diaz
has people everywhere.

122
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,951
I'll run background checks
on all the city officials.

123
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,040
Makes sense to start at the top,
work your way down.

124
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,626
Look, Oliver, if you need to spend
more time at City Hall,

125
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,797
I get it, man.

126
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,297
Keep your focus there.
I can cover us here.

127
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,923
No, my focus is fine.

128
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,968
But, Oliver,
why split yourself in two, man?

129
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,099
Let me carry the load for you.

130
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,844
The city needs the mayor now
more than it ever did.

131
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,849
It also needs the Green Arrow.

132
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,567
And that's not me anymore.

133
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,190
I've been waiting
for the right moment,

134
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,523
the appropriate moment to tell you.

135
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,192
I'm not giving up the hood.

136
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,609
I guess I should have taken the hint

137
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,820
the way you kept
putting me off, right?

138
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,121
You know, John, this team,

139
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,824
this mission...

140
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,371
It's all of us.

141
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,827
You helped build it.

142
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,129
I don't understand why it matters

143
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,797
what somebody's wearing.

144
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,085
I guess it doesn't.

145
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,342
That's the moment
you were waiting for. That one?

146
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,976
At least now he knows.

147
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,979
John's an adult, Felicity,
he'll be fine.

148
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,402
Hope so.

149
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,909
Hey, pal. Get your butt off my car.

150
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,950
You eat like crap, officer.

151
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,780
Freeze!

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,332
I heard about you.

153
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,580
You're real brash.

154
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,666
You gotta show everybody
how tough you are, huh?

155
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,961
Poking around where you don't belong.

156
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,751
Get your hands up.

157
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,507
Funny thing about that, though,

158
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,469
you always end up
pissing off the wrong guy.

159
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,095
You didn't want to torture him a bit?

160
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,975
You know, maybe slit his throat.

161
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,684
What happened to all that Russian
vengeance I heard so much about?

162
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,523
Is new suit.

163
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,069
His dead body will send
good message to other police.

164
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,901
That's right.

165
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,279
We're all on borrowed time.

166
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,373
<i>Still no suspects
in the death of Officer Hurst,</i>

167
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,628
<i>a six-year veteran with the SCPD</i>

168
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,802
<i>found dead last night
under mysterious circumstances.</i>

169
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,388
Not so mysterious
if you're Ricardo Diaz.

170
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,635
I need to contact Dinah

171
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,966
and have her sequester
the other officers

172
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,301
involved in arresting Anatoly.

173
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,431
What about your DA friend?

174
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,262
Any idea how Diaz flipped him?

175
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,018
I'm guessing cold, hard cash.

176
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,098
Cash he took from the city?

177
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,728
Should all be dried up by now.

178
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,900
So he has another source.

179
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,023
Well, according to Curtis,

180
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,025
Diaz is involved
in an extensive Vertigo operation

181
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,947
and if my math is right,
and it definitely is,

182
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,241
he'll be pulling in
at least a million a day.

183
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,277
So we take out his Vertigo stash,

184
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,782
we kill his cash supply.

185
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,864
Unless he's got a rich aunt somewhere,
yeah, that'll work.

186
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,166
Right. I'll just go
check in with Lyla.

187
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,084
See if A.R.G.U.S.
can give us any information

188
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,127
on this Vertigo operation
that can help us.

189
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,005
Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks, John.

190
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,418
That was unbearable.

191
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,628
He was fine.

192
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,465
The fuming, the standing
in the corner, that was fine?

193
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,801
John is not going to get bent
out of shape over a uniform.

194
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,851
He's a soldier, Oliver.

195
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,189
Look, I get what you're saying.
That this is not like John.

196
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,642
But you have to see
what he's not saying. He's upset.

197
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,443
Then he's gonna have to get over it.

198
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,737
This is not our first fight.

199
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,314
Well, if you don't want it
to be your last,

200
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,398
you should probably say something.

201
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,779
- Like what?
- Something to ease the pain.

202
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,286
We need to know more
about Diaz's Vertigo operation.

203
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,741
I need to get to City Hall

204
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,827
and talk some sense
into Hill and Armand

205
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,411
before somebody else gets killed.

206
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,080
Yeah.

207
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,722
I think I found a secure location.

208
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,549
To sequester the clean cops?
I'll come with.

209
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,633
No, Curtis. I'm the one

210
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,469
who brought these guys
into the fight against Diaz.

211
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,429
I'm the reason
he's retaliating against them.

212
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,513
This is all on me.

213
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,021
Well, don't be all
Oliver Queen on me now.

214
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,236
If we have to take out Diaz,
there's going to be casualties.

215
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,984
And they're not going
to be your fault, Dinah.

216
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,565
No, they're not,

217
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,025
because I'm going to make sure
there are no more casualties.

218
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,109
We're going to make sure.

219
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,153
I'm gonna bring cops
to a secure location

220
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,159
nobody knows about
except my good friend Curtis.

221
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,615
I'll be your tech guy.

222
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,953
Look, I don't like the idea of you
doing this without backup.

223
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,664
That, or you want to spend some
quality time with your new boyfriend.

224
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,124
We've only been on three dates.

225
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,167
But, yeah, he's cute,
and I don't want him to get murdered,

226
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,547
so sue me.

227
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,138
Let's go, lover boy.

228
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,006
Yes!

229
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,221
This is everything
A.R.G.U.S. could find

230
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,927
on the Vertigo trade in Star City.

231
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,598
Yeah, thanks.

232
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,064
It's not free.

233
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,487
I need intel in return.

234
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,193
What kind of intel?

235
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,445
The kind where you tell me
what's going on with you.

236
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,365
Lyla, you know what's going on.

237
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,958
I'm frustrated that Oliver
strung me along for so long.

238
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,333
Being the Green Arrow,

239
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,253
you know what that meant to me.

240
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,182
But you save this city
every night as Spartan.

241
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,471
It's not like you to care this much
about a title or a hood.

242
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,180
Oliver made a similar point.

243
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,897
- But...
- I don't know.

244
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,527
I just don't know.

245
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,777
This is bothering me
way more than I expected.

246
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,653
I think you owe it to yourself

247
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,954
and to your partnership with Oliver

248
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,949
to figure out why.

249
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,252
Thank you both for coming.

250
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,425
I have to say, Mr. Mayor,
I'm more than a little uncomfortable

251
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,047
meeting with you
without your attorney present.

252
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,879
Well, it's not about the case, Sam.

253
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,347
It's about the two
of you working for Ricardo Diaz.

254
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,434
Who? I'm not sure
I've ever heard that name before.

255
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,182
You're smarter than this.

256
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,226
You're better than this.

257
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,650
Both of you are better than this.

258
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,479
Talk to me.

259
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,445
Less than 24 hours
after you promoted me

260
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,074
to take over Pike's command,

261
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,246
I got an email.

262
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,581
Surveillance photos of my niece,
my father and my sister.

263
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,208
- So he found a way to apply pressure.
- Yeah.

264
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,542
Okay.

265
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,550
My boy has cancer.

266
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,211
Leukemia. Stage four.

267
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,049
Even with the city's insurance,
we couldn't afford the treatments.

268
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,471
I needed Diaz's money.

269
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,723
All right.
We can protect your family.

270
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,223
We can pay for your son's treatments.
This city...

271
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,478
Is bankrupt.

272
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,519
The idea of you
protecting anyone is a joke.

273
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,192
The whole force
is under Diaz's thumb.

274
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,405
Or were you offering your protection
as the Green Arrow?

275
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,736
If I was the Green Arrow,

276
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,829
I don't think you'd wanna
be in this room right now.

277
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,746
I don't think either of you would.

278
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,456
Are we done here?

279
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,842
You are.

280
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,425
You're both fired.
Effective immediately.

281
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,886
- You can't do that.
- If you work for him...

282
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,725
Then you don't work for me.

283
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,517
Get out.

284
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,488
I know you're the Green Arrow,

285
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,322
but this is unlike anything
you've ever gone up against.

286
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,874
Diaz has already beaten you
and you don't even know it.

287
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,831
<i>Still no suspects
in the death of Officer Hurst,</i>

288
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,587
<i>a six-year veteran
with the SCPD found...</i>

289
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,384
Looks like
you've had an exciting day.

290
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,554
I wouldn't call the death
of a respected SCPD officer exciting.

291
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,345
It is when you've been
sitting on the couch all day.

292
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,051
Well, no one's holding you prisoner.
Why don't you get out?

293
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,135
Go get some sun, maybe.

294
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,595
No. Sounds boring.

295
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,931
Helping you with your Diaz situation,

296
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,891
now that sounds interesting to me.

297
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,524
I'm guessing the death of that cop
wasn't exactly random though, was it?

298
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,898
You know something about that?

299
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,035
I know Diaz and he's not
gonna stop at one officer.

300
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,487
Yeah, we figured that.

301
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,035
We sequestered the rest.
They're safe.

302
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,161
Safe where, though?

303
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,711
How do you expect me
to be like Laurel

304
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,288
when you won't let me act like her?

305
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,623
You want to act like Laurel?

306
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,751
Why don't you do something good, huh?
Get a job, help this city.

307
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,928
I've never had a real job
in my whole life.

308
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,465
I don't even think
I know how to write a resume.

309
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,221
You don't need to write a resume.
You're Laurel Lance, remember?

310
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,890
How well did I do in law school?

311
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,808
Wait here.

312
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,397
I kept all of Laurel's old law books.

313
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,069
Look at that.

314
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,574
Maybe you could start right here.

315
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,405
You wanna home-law-school me?

316
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,911
Beats sitting around
on a couch, doesn't it?

317
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,492
I mean, who knows?
You could give it a shot,

318
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,954
you might just enjoy
doing something good for a change.

319
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,140
Hey, how did it...

320
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,019
I can tell by the look on your face,
won't even ask.

321
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,096
Would you please
give me some good news.

322
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,308
Lyla clued us in on one of
Diaz's suppliers. Marshall Katz.

323
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,688
I'm running location on him now.

324
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,360
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

325
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,283
- I'll be right back.
- Mmm-hmm.

326
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,743
Thanks for grabbing
that intel from Lyla.

327
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,200
No problem.

328
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,794
About the hood.

329
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,084
- I'd like to apologize.
- Oliver...

330
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,216
It's just a piece of cloth.

331
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,711
Just like you said.

332
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,382
- You were right.
- I was wrong about a few things.

333
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,054
It's very important
that you know this.

334
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,933
When I asked you to take over for me,
I meant it.

335
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,522
When I put the hood back on and said,

336
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,349
"It's just until
you get back on your feet."

337
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,902
I meant it, but I did
put the hood back on and...

338
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,609
It's a part of me.

339
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,407
It makes me feel

340
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,237
like I'm being
the best version of myself and...

341
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,739
I feel whole.

342
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,536
And I feel complete.

343
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,537
And I really, really hope
that this is making sense.

344
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,706
Yeah.

345
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,334
The hood is part of you now.

346
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,385
I should have been upfront with you.

347
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,887
And I avoided having what I thought
might be a tough conversation.

348
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,722
Well...

349
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,562
I appreciate you
telling me this, Oliver.

350
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,353
Thank you.

351
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,858
Got a location on Katz.

352
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,981
Yeah, let's move.

353
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,659
Baby.

354
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,831
I want some V.

355
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,372
I told you before...

356
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,246
Can't do it.

357
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,632
Only top-grade for my lady.

358
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,803
Well, don't you know
how to make a girl feel special.

359
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:00,975
We got a problem.

360
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,095
Moore downstairs
spotted one of the masks.

361
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,725
- He's on his way up.
- Go! Do something!

362
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,522
- Get behind us.
- Yeah, no kidding.

363
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:15,899
Sit.

364
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,411
You're gonna tell us
where you make your Vertigo shipment.

365
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,829
And turn on the Dragon?

366
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,948
You'll have to shoot me, man.

367
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,578
I don't want to waste my arrows.

368
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,910
I think you should.

369
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,624
This punk deserves it.

370
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,253
I'm not nearly
as stingy with my bullets.

371
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,252
Where do you ship the V from?

372
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,054
I'm too high to die man, please.

373
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,972
Spartan, stand down.

374
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,595
When he tells us
what we need to know.

375
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,769
You wouldn't kill me
in front of my lady.

376
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,683
Last chance. Where's the Vertigo?

377
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,763
Spartan!

378
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,682
Stand down!

379
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,766
And what?

380
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,443
Do this your way?

381
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,519
He'll fold.

382
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,525
- Talk.
- Fine.

383
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,074
But you gotta send me
to, like, Mexico, man.

384
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,490
Diaz will find me.

385
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,995
My loyalty is to Diaz, not him.

386
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,803
That was a bust. Get it?

387
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,346
'Cause it's drugs.
It's like a play on words

388
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,890
and it's almost a little fun.

389
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,810
Never mind.
Tough crowd. What happened?

390
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,056
We lost Katz.

391
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,772
Oliver, he was gonna talk.

392
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,731
If you had just let me
keep the pressure on him

393
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,936
for one minute longer,

394
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,398
we would be at the location right now
instead of back at square one.

395
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,027
No. He still would have gotten shot

396
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,659
because you picked a fight.

397
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,738
You pulled our focus and you
allowed our target to get killed.

398
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,791
Because you know everything and
I just need to keep my mouth shut.

399
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,247
I'm sorry. What?

400
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,921
Look, guys, we're all just whipped-up

401
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,006
with adrenaline from the field.

402
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,630
And we're gonna catch Diaz.
We always catch the bad guys.

403
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,054
So we're just
going to breathe together.

404
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,176
Inhale...

405
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,929
John, what's going on with you?

406
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,847
First, you were mad at me
because you're not the Green Arrow.

407
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,226
That is...

408
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,939
That is way
out of character for you, my friend.

409
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,855
But I explained myself.

410
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,819
I apologized.

411
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,987
You accepted.

412
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,662
And now you're going to
take a shot at me like that?

413
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,366
I was getting someplace with Katz.

414
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,116
And you

415
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,618
didn't back my play.

416
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,953
'Cause it wasn't working.

417
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,037
No, Oliver!

418
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,456
Because it wasn't your play.

419
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,388
Let me know
when you find the Vertigo.

420
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,227
I need some air.

421
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,455
I already told you. I don't know
where they sequestered the cops.

422
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,753
And if you're here
to put pressure on Lance,

423
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,454
don't.

424
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,415
Because I'm all healed up now.

425
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,508
You want to calm down?

426
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,132
I brought you dinner.

427
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm not hungry.

428
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,805
What are you doing here?

429
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,684
Just checking up on things.

430
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,725
Looks like some light reading.

431
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,311
Just trying to maintain my cover.

432
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,443
Don't waste your time.
People like us don't learn the law.

433
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,574
People like us...

434
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,401
We are the law.

435
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,865
You trying to make your daddy proud?

436
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,620
Why would I ever want to do that?

437
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,995
'Cause I used to be like that
with my old man.

438
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,049
Before he died.

439
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,547
It's exhausting trying
to be something you're not.

440
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,006
Oh, so what?

441
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,598
You're gonna tell me
what I'm supposed to be,

442
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,724
is that it?

443
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,895
No.

444
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,900
I see what I like.

445
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,945
I know you're pretending
to be the real Laurel,

446
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,487
but the one standing
in front of me right now...

447
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,995
She don't need changing.

448
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,451
Your fries are getting cold.

449
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,462
Hey.

450
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,336
Hi.

451
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,302
- Everything all right?
- Fine.

452
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,300
I've been out of town for so long,
I just found the gift

453
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,097
you left for me back in December.

454
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,595
I wanted to say thank you.

455
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,723
- You're welcome.
- Funny though,

456
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,181
the same day you delivered it
I also found a security breach

457
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,560
on my computer.

458
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,439
I guess I now know how Cayden James

459
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,112
got a hold
of our nano aluminum amplifier.

460
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,406
I was gonna tell you about that,
Lyla, but, um...

461
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,113
City was at stake.

462
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,115
Yeah, well, the city
is always at stake.

463
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,697
You don't have to lie to your wife
in order to save it.

464
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,828
You're absolutely right.

465
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,369
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,578
I know.

467
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,213
What brings you by?

468
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,672
Well, Oliver apologized for
stringing me along about the hood.

469
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,508
It was actually a good apology.

470
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,714
Wow.

471
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,966
That's not exactly
Oliver's strong suit.

472
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,050
No, it's not.

473
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,554
But?

474
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,604
I don't know.

475
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,027
I thought we cleared the air.

476
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,821
We go out into the field,
we come back and then I...

477
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,655
I just take a piece right out of him.

478
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,866
Over nothing.

479
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,869
It was over nothing.

480
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,628
You're right,
there's something wrong.

481
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,749
And I'm worried that
when I find out what it is,

482
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:06,924
I'm not gonna like it.

483
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,718
Well, from everything you've told me,

484
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,803
there's not a lot to like these days.

485
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,634
The team breaking up,

486
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,388
Rene's in the hospital,
Diaz is running rampant.

487
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:21,189
Maybe the reason Oliver holding on
to the hood bothered you so much,

488
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,350
is because you think
none of these things

489
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,652
would've happened if you had
been the one still wearing it.

490
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,154
Seriously,
thanks for helping us out here.

491
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,360
I mean, anything for Dinah.

492
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,453
Maybe I was a little
worried about you too.

493
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,780
I'll be fine.

494
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,036
Just hate leaving the city
to be overrun by a bunch

495
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,163
of corrupt cops and
vigilantes.

496
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,083
Don't you think there's a little bit
of a difference between

497
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,505
bent cops and vigilantes.

498
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,416
None that I can see.

499
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,167
They're both criminals, right?

500
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,677
Yeah.

501
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,382
Hey.

502
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,226
Listen, do you think
we could have the room?

503
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,224
Yeah, yeah, of course.

504
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,406
- Get some air?
- Yeah, I did.

505
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,319
And with it, some clarity.

506
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,372
Oliver, it's totally within
your rights.

507
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,673
To keep the hood, it's yours.

508
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,632
You're right, my frustration
was never with the uniform.

509
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,299
It was with the man underneath it.

510
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,599
I don't understand.

511
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,682
I didn't either, not at first.

512
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,815
I so appreciated your apology.

513
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,364
But something about it gnawed at me.

514
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,989
That you needed to be
the Green Arrow,

515
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,787
that it completed you.

516
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,160
This was supposed to be about

517
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,253
saving the city.

518
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,589
Helping the people.

519
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,336
Not ourselves.

520
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,713
I know that.

521
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,930
It's a little too dangerous.

522
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,761
And I've lost just a little too much
along the way for it

523
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,766
- to be about that.
- But yet here you are.

524
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,649
You've gotten married, raising a son,

525
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,226
- you've become the mayor.
- So what?

526
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,812
So, Oliver, you were never
supposed to stretch yourself so thin.

527
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,281
And in so many different directions,

528
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,776
that the people suffer.

529
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,285
We have been in tough spots before.

530
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,407
We have with a team.

531
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,995
Even before Curtis, Rene and Dinah,
there was Roy, there was Thea,

532
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,296
but, Oliver, the way you lead

533
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,296
alienates everyone and everything
around you, look.

534
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,965
Putting the team under surveillance
was a mistake.

535
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,060
We had an opportunity to save
the Vigilante.

536
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,887
You made a different call.

537
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,768
The same with Laurel and the money.

538
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:11,522
When did all of these
just magically become my decisions?

539
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:16,361
I seem to remember you right there
next to me.

540
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,239
Begging you to exercise restraint,
caution, Oliver.

541
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,743
But that's not you, you have changed,
you have grown so much

542
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,950
and it's been my honor,
it's been my privilege to watch you.

543
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,127
But Oliver, you're still you

544
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,000
and if you're just
doing this for you,

545
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,002
- like you just admitted...
- I didn't say I was doing it

546
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,254
- just for myself.
- If this isn't 100%

547
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,710
for our city,

548
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,132
then you are not the hero

549
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,596
that it deserves.

550
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,509
And you never will be.

551
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,680
Ricardo Diaz

552
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,640
has...

553
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:56,188
God knows, how much of our city
in his grip,

554
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,235
and you're picking now
to lecture me or to whine

555
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,990
about not getting a promotion?

556
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,493
Promotion, this isn't about
a promotion, man.

557
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,620
This is about you and Diaz,
you still can't see it.

558
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,327
- See what?
- He's already won, Oliver,

559
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,084
he has the city wired
and it happened under your watch.

560
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,008
He showed up
while you were the Green Arrow!

561
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,089
You bought drugs from him, John.

562
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,422
You funded what he is doing right now!

563
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,179
The entire time I put you
in that hood

564
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,431
and you hid having a drug problem.

565
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,808
And I was putting
my body through hell

566
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,980
- for the sake of our city.
- No, you put the team at risk

567
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,311
by lying!

568
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,113
I had to dive off a bridge
to save Rene's life,

569
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,026
because you were in the field,
you weren't 100%,

570
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,235
and nobody knew it.

571
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,570
You really wanna
bring up Rene right now

572
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,407
when he is still hospitalized
for the beating that you put on him?

573
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,116
We were in the field against

574
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,669
Dinah, Curtis and Rene,
he pulls a gun on me.

575
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,623
- You think he gave me a choice?
- I think that you leave

576
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:57,833
a trail of bodies

577
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,088
every damn place that you go.

578
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,593
Sure, you've changed.

579
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,888
But what comfort is that to William?

580
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,730
Whose mother is dead because
of the bad decisions

581
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,931
that you've made.

582
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,703
My trail of bodies

583
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,117
doesn't include my own brother.

584
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,034
Stop!

585
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,362
What are you two doing?
That's enough.

586
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,706
Have you two gone
completely over the edge?

587
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,377
Diaz is running through the city
like a cancer

588
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:24,461
and you two are in here
doing what exactly?

589
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,714
Okay.

590
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,554
This is what's going to happen.

591
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,474
I am gonna go back to work,

592
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,772
looking for the needle
that is Diaz's Vertigo operation

593
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,895
in the city's haystack
and the two of you

594
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,103
are gonna pull your heads
out of your asses!

595
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,994
- She's right.
- She usually is.

596
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,003
Sorry I punched you, Oliver.

597
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,216
Sorry I punched you back.

598
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,135
For what it's worth,

599
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,224
I know you've done a lot of good,

600
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,513
I know lately it seems like everyone's
been questioning your leadership.

601
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,856
Me included.

602
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,901
Found the location of Diaz's
Vertigo operation,

603
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,196
have you two found
any shred of sanity?

604
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,564
Perhaps?

605
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,361
Let's go.

606
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,788
So he just drops it casually,

607
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,091
"I hate vigilantes."
Not "hate" but "hate,"

608
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,794
like capital letters,
"hates vigilantes."

609
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,633
This is Paul all over again.

610
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,923
Well, that's kind of a leap.

611
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,555
Paul divorced me because
I was a vigilante.

612
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,055
Curtis, you're getting
ahead of yourself.

613
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,808
Yeah, you're right,
he's not gonna break up with me.

614
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,764
- That's the spirit.
- He's going to arrest me.

615
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,440
I know I'm the last person
who should be giving you

616
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,607
relationship advice.

617
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,935
Yet you're about to give me some.

618
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,736
It's more of a life philosophy.

619
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,522
Just live in the moment.

620
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,323
Because you can only see
the step that's ahead of you,

621
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,945
you don't know what's
at the end of the road.

622
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,285
Someone just set off
one of my proximity alerts,

623
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,916
make that some-many.

624
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,413
All headed toward the front door.

625
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,620
- How did they find us?
- Who?

626
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,375
Diaz's men, they're about
to hit us from the west,

627
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,751
the north, the south,
they're about to hit us

628
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,548
- from every angle.
- I know.

629
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,420
I'm sorry, but we can't defeat Diaz.

630
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,964
We tried and we failed.

631
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,216
No!

632
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,219
You stay with Curtis.

633
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,521
Curtis.

634
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,408
I count 13 bogies in this den alone,
heavily armed.

635
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,288
No Diaz.

636
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,163
Got at least 20 million
of Vertigo here. He's gonna miss it.

637
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,089
The only way that we'll make it
out of here

638
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,461
is if we trust each other.

639
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,507
We've been through worse, Oliver.

640
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,589
I'm not sure that we have, John.

641
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,636
You're quarterback.

642
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,634
Call it.

643
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,720
Let's move.

644
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,321
We're under fire,
get the product out of here now.

645
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,441
Hold on, Curtis,
we're gonna get you to a hospital.

646
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,616
Okay? Hold on.

647
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,580
I'm okay.

648
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,406
Actually that's a lie,
I think my ribs are broken.

649
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,158
- You were shot point blank.
- No!

650
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,081
- You're...
- It's not what it looks like.

651
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,917
Okay, it is what it looks like.

652
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,092
Okay, go.

653
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,466
Place is bigger than expected,
how many more explosives do we have?

654
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,971
<i>- I'm all out.</i>
- Then we improvise.

655
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,852
Vertigo's flammable
in its liquid state.

656
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,184
- Headed there now.
- You won't make it.

657
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,438
Not alone I won't.

658
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,966
It's just like John Wayne,

659
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,093
"It's better to have loved and lost
than to never have loved at all."

660
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,890
Are we getting out of here or not?

661
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,890
Okay. There's an opening
on the east side of the building.

662
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,893
You know there is no opening
on the east side of the building!

663
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,190
Well then, make one.

664
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,988
All right, let's go!
Move, move, move, move!

665
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,449
Let's go, everybody come on. Move!

666
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,784
Do it.

667
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,172
Thanks for having my back.

668
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,437
Judging by the burn radius
of the warehouse,

669
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,393
looks like
we got all of Diaz's stash.

670
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,653
Oliver, I'm really sorry
about what I said.

671
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,073
You apologized already, John,
so did I.

672
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,361
I know.

673
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,072
I know.

674
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,420
But what I said about the calls
you've made.

675
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,790
Where you've brought us.

676
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,501
The team, the city...
I just can't shake them.

677
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,215
What, you can't shake that you said it?

678
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,922
I can't shake that it's true.

679
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,308
Oliver, for six years,

680
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,311
I have followed the chain of command
without question,

681
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,605
even when my heart told me
there was a better way.

682
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,770
I trusted it, I trusted you.

683
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:59,230
But the inescapable truth
is that people have lost faith

684
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,531
in your leadership.

685
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,580
Truth is, Oliver, you have become
a better man.

686
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,667
But with your focus split...

687
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,620
A worse leader.

688
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,008
The Green Arrow allows you
to become the best version

689
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,426
of yourself and I respect that.

690
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,844
I respect you.

691
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,015
But if I'm gonna be
the best version of myself,

692
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,051
Oliver,

693
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,148
it can't be with you.

694
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,988
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

695
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,454
John.

696
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:53,830
Don't do this.

697
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,922
Thank you so much
for helping me get Zoe

698
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,098
- up for school.
- Yeah, sure.

699
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,267
Just don't understand
how a girl so small

700
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,719
generates this much mess.

701
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,560
You know I actually
don't mind tidying up.

702
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,936
Kind of like it.

703
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,733
Keeps my mind off of things

704
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,233
like the fact that my boyfriend
is going to break up with me,

705
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,188
because he found out I'm a vigilante,

706
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,195
and he hates vigilantes.

707
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,485
So he is your boyfriend.

708
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,287
My mind works in hyperbole.

709
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,033
Ignoring for a second

710
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:38,872
the operational risk of having
a cop know your identity.

711
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,173
Do you regret him knowing the truth?

712
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,513
Besides the fact that it means
ending our relationship,

713
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,340
- I don't.
- Well...

714
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,184
Then it was worth it.

715
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,607
Speak of the devil.

716
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,476
- It's Nick.
- Wait, what?

717
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,149
- Lieutenant Drake.
- Not looking for me,

718
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,278
I assume?

719
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,739
No, but I'm glad you're here.

720
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,741
Hill just canned me.

721
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,406
And you.

722
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,958
And the rest of us,
anyone who wasn't dirty.

723
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,419
Last thing she did before
clearing out her desk.

724
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,417
We're gonna fight this, Nick, okay?
Don't worry.

725
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,540
Come in.

726
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,922
I should probably find
a reason to leave.

727
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,223
See you later.

728
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,387
- Hey.
- Hey.

729
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,722
- You go first.
- Okay.

730
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,518
Listen.

731
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,565
I know

732
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,739
you're not a fan of vigilantes.

733
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,867
So, I get it, if you wanna...

734
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,903
Step away from this.

735
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,909
Curtis, I just lost my job
for being a clean cop.

736
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,160
I know.

737
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,618
With the department compromised,
maybe vigilantism is the only way

738
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,623
to take back the city, I don't know.

739
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,167
To be honest,

740
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,466
I don't know how I feel
about vigilantes.

741
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,468
But I do know how I feel about you.

742
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,481
You okay?

743
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,979
I know it had to be done.

744
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,664
You had to do this your way.

745
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,208
I wish I knew what this was,

746
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,754
Lyla.

747
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,131
I know I wanna keep
fighting for the city.

748
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,261
I just don't know
what that looks like on my own.

749
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,555
Maybe you don't do it alone.

750
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,229
Maybe you do it with me.

751
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,687
Here.

752
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,613
A.R.G.U.S.?

753
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,363
I've got people
breaking into my office,

754
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,285
stealing stuff.

755
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,293
And really...

756
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,704
I could use an extra pair of hands.

757
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,969
Hey.

758
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,898
I know it's rough.

759
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,442
But you'll always have me.

760
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,774
I'm not going anywhere.

761
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:57,778
What's up, Quentin?

762
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,989
<i>Turn on the TV, any channel.</i>

763
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,839
<i>Obviously the Mayor terminated us
to impede the prosecution</i>

764
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,336
<i>of his activities as the Green Arrow.</i>

765
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,461
<i>What Oliver Queen did
is an impeachable offense.</i>

766
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,970
<i>It was a gross overstep of power.</i>

767
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,183
<i>Our Mayor should be held
accountable for his actions.</i>

768
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,258
<i>Thank you.</i>

769
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,219
Armand said that was your idea.

770
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,978
Looks like reading those law books
really paid off.

771
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,270
Guess I was wrong.

772
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,023
You were right about
something else though.

773
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,068
I'm not changing who I really am.

774
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,199
I have one last surprise for you.

775
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,796
There is one left.

776
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,424
And I know just how to use it.
