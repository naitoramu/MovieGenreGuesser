1
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,801
We know the ones in there were there before,

2
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:10,001
I want you to go over the recordings again.

3
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:12,801
from the security cameras.
- Get as close as you can.

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,441
There, stop it.
- It's a car key,

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,601
is a '92 Ibiza.

6
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:19,561
- Search scrapyards, car cemeteries and like.

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,961
The scientist has confirmed the presence
of ammonia and alcohol.

8
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,321
on the dashboard, upholstery, glass...

9
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,561
Someone related to the gang was there.

10
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:34,041
almost at the same time as us.
- I need you to step outside
for a few minutes.

11
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,521
There's a mole among us.

12
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,081
- And what are we going to do?
- Find it.

13
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,361
I broke the first rule of the plan,
I killed a hostage.

14
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,761
You've fucked everything up.
You're going to have to punish me,

15
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:47,401
because if you don't have the guts,
this isn't gonna work out.

16
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,841
They've managed to isolate a fingerprint

17
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,721
on the button you found on the Ibiza.

18
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,361
Andrés de Fonollosa, currently
in search and capture.

19
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,521
We could talk to his cellmate.

20
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:01,641
- He shared a cell with that man.
- He injected himself with medication,

21
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,761
every day.

22
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:05,361
Retroxil, is a rare medication,
ordered on demand.

23
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,601
Used to palliate tremors of
a degenerative disease,

24
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:12,201
in less than 24 months he will be dead.
- That man has nothing to lose.

25
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:15,081
If you really want to negotiate with me,
release eight hostages.

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,681
Look, I'll give you something,
I'll give you Alison Parker.

27
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:19,961
and no one else.
I have to consult it.

28
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,881
- I'll take the responsibility.
- Alison Parker.

29
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:26,001
"The profesor had ordered me
to filter the conversation

30
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,121
with the inspector."

31
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,081
Well? Alison Parker.

32
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:33,001
Would you rather save Alison Parker's life

33
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,561
than eight hostages?
Yes, I'm sure.

34
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,601
I'm not a fucking Nazi,
I remind you that you got yourself

35
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,961
a cell phone in my panties,
that I was sent to kill you.

36
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,241
And what did you do?
You shot me in the leg,

37
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,321
you've got me locked up,
I can't even breathe.

38
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,841
I can't go to the bathroom,
I have to take care of myself.

39
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,161
in a bucket.
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:50,961
I'm gonna take you to the bathroom,
okay?

41
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:54,201
I want you to leak everything
about this guy to the press.

42
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,081
- I don't think the public will
be won over

43
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,201
saying that the boss of the kidnappers

44
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,161
he's an eccentric,
he'll need something else.

45
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,401
- Andrés de Fonollosa is also
credited with

46
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:04,081
other crimes of a sexual nature.

47
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:07,201
Denver. My face keeps coming
out on the news.

48
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,361
And all for one button.
You just fucked up my life.

49
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,361
- I'll make it up to you with
10 or 15 million of mine, okay?

50
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,441
- Leave him, Berlín.
- What's going on here?

51
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,281
Denver?

52
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,841
Denver, is that you?

53
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,041
I sent you to kill her on a Friday.

54
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:55,801
And today is Sunday.

55
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:03,081
Resurrection Sunday.

56
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:10,721
Praise the Lord.

57
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,001
Excuse me, I'm going to let
you finish calmly.

58
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:20,121
I don't want to be the one
who disturbs your privacy.

59
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,321
I'm going to make a confession to you, Denver.

60
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,281
When I saw her lying there, dead,

61
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,321
something in me stirred.

62
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,321
Sometimes I rush.

63
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:57,401
This character of mine.

64
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:04,041
Of course, this is still
an awkward situation.

65
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,761
and we're gonna have to fix it,
but how?

66
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,721
On one side of the scale, Denver,
you've got the bad.

67
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,401
You disobeyed me.

68
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,201
I asked you to kill her,

69
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,961
because that woman jeopardized
the plan,

70
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,921
our plan. And you saved her.
Not to mention the button,

71
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:38,081
that because of your clumsiness
has put my face in the news,

72
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,681
airports, police stations...

73
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,041
And now you have definitely broken
my future.

74
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,121
And on the other side of the scale
you have that woman...

75
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,001
is alive.

76
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:55,521
And I ask myself: which side of the scale

77
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:56,721
Do you think it weights more?

78
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,441
- Don't fuck with me, Berlín,
this isn't a Tarantino film, huh?

79
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,561
Put the gun down.

80
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:07,681
Put the gun down.

81
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,761
- Nairobi, you put the gun down.

82
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:16,321
- What? I don't know.
- You put the gun down.

83
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,601
We're gonna fix this.
Put the gun down.

84
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:21,161
Put the gun down.

85
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:38,401
Who are you gonna blow off now,
huh, freak?

86
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:42,921
Let's all calm down and put down
all our weapons.

87
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:45,841
Berlín, Denver, everybody,
you too.

88
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,161
Tell it to your cousin, come on.

89
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:54,401
- I'm sick of your orders and your
little shitty speeches.

90
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:57,001
Shall I tell you which side of the scale
weights heavier, shall I tell you?

91
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,481
- Wait, Denver, take it easy.

92
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:08,041
I'll tell you, hold still.

93
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,921
- Careful.
- No, listen to me.

94
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:18,481
You know what weights the most.

95
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,761
Life, of course, Denver.

96
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:31,241
Yes, sir.
So for once, gentlemen,

97
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,161
we're going to lower our weapons,

98
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:41,001
because there are certain occasions...

99
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,321
that life is a miracle...

100
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,401
that's worth celebrating.

101
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:51,961
What are you doing?

102
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:58,361
Holy shit, she's alive.
She's alive, Tokio.

103
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,761
Look at her, Denver,
like those flowers that grow.

104
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,281
in the cracked asphalt.

105
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:07,881
- That's it.

106
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:10,121
- That's it, yeah.
That's it.

107
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,321
That's it.

108
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,361
Berlín, I'm sorry to cut you off,
but you have to go upstairs,

109
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,401
the Profesor calls you.

110
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,801
Are you there?
Where were you?

111
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:43,161
Let's say a kind of spiritual journey.

112
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,521
And the truth is,
I'm back as a new man.

113
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:47,681
I'm glad.

114
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,081
Because there's something important
you need to know.

115
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,201
I put the button on your jacket
on the Seat Ibiza.

116
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:05,361
You killed a hostage, you crossed
the red line,

117
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:06,801
so this is your punishment.

118
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,481
It hurts to hear that,
it hurts horrors.

119
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:14,601
And frankly, I think it's a very
unfair measure.

120
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,641
You see, I want you to hear something.

121
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:30,801
What's your name?

122
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:33,481
My name is Mónica Gaztambide.

123
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,721
And how are you?
Good.

124
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,281
And you're alive.
I am alive.

125
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,201
And very pretty.
Thank you.

126
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,681
Now do you understand why you
are an unjust man?

127
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,681
You punish me for something that
hasn't happened yet.

128
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:55,761
I admire your cynicism, but I understand
if that woman is still alive,

129
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,401
it's not exactly thanks to you.
Unfortunately, there is no turning back.

130
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:04,121
The good news for everyone is
that thanks to this happy ending

131
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:06,321
we can implement the Valencia plan.

132
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:13,481
Gentlemen, the Valencia plan is activated.

133
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:15,401
Now.

134
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:23,241
Fire!

135
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,161
What's that?

136
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,161
- M-16 bursts.

137
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:40,361
Several guns firing at the same time.
- Listen up, there are people screaming.

138
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:19,881
I've spoken to scientist and ballistics,

139
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,681
I've sent them the recordings and
they say they have at least

140
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:24,161
three M-16s.
- How many bullets?

141
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,961
- Approximately 150, five or six magazines.

142
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,121
- It's a carnage.

143
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:31,001
- It's not an execution, it's a brawl.
Get me the factory.

144
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,761
What the fuck is going on out there,
what have you done?

145
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:48,121
Aren't you going to say good afternoon?
Good afternoon?

146
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,521
After you've leaked our conversations
to the press,

147
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:55,081
that you sold me out in front of
the public.

148
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,321
and after hearing that shooting in there.

149
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:00,161
But what kind of insane are you?
Inspector, really

150
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,881
I don't recognize you.
You are an intelligent woman,

151
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,441
we have conducted this negotiation
with mutual respect,

152
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,681
both professionally and personally.

153
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,521
I would even dare say that even with
a certain affection

154
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,401
on my part.
So if you'll excuse me,

155
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:14,521
I'm gonna hang him and
we're gonna start over.

156
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,641
But what...?

157
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:50,801
Call.

158
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:57,961
Good afternoon, Profesor.

159
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:00,601
Good afternoon.

160
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:04,961
Look, I was here thinking about
my stuff.

161
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:09,361
and suddenly it occurred
to me to think:

162
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,201
what kind of music will this
man listen to

163
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:13,921
when you shower every morning?

164
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:20,241
It's going to sound strange,
but what gives me more energy...

165
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,161
is a Greek sirtaki.

166
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,521
I don't know,
it puts me in a good mood.

167
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:30,801
Funny, isn't it?
You are of Greek descent.

168
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,681
No, no, not really.

169
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,561
But I don't know, I love Anthony
Quinn's movies.

170
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:39,281
It's cheerful music, really.

171
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:43,121
Not as much as the shots we heard in there.

172
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,441
No, of course not.

173
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,241
Could you tell me exactly what it was?

174
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:51,521
Of course, with great pleasure.
You see, we've been testing

175
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:53,881
weapons that we thought had gotten wet,

176
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,921
but they work perfectly.
Thank you very much for asking.

177
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,961
You're welcome.
It's a very plausible explanation,

178
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:02,241
but there is another possibility,

179
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,681
that everything was twisted
and they had to open fire.

180
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:06,801
against the hostages.

181
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,001
Yes, that would be another possibility.

182
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,921
I imagine that in his hand is to
be more or less optimistic.

183
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:16,681
Then you won't mind me asking you for something.

184
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:21,481
Inspector, I'm so sorry,

185
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,801
but I dance very badly.
How?

186
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,641
The sirtaki,
if you ask me to dance with you,

187
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,481
I'm so sorry, but it's not gonna happen.

188
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,001
No, it's not that.

189
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,201
Look.

190
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,081
I want proof of every hostage's life,

191
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:38,921
recorded to this day,

192
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,801
in front of a live TV set.

193
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,001
And it's non-negotiable.

194
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:46,001
I wouldn't dare haggle
with something so sensitive, Inspector.

195
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,601
You have one hour to send them.

196
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,041
Yes?
Prepare the proofs of life.

197
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,841
There's no butler here to wash your hands.

198
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:29,921
You're gonna be the only one who's gonna get out,
we're staying here.

199
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,961
- Well
- So brave

200
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:34,201
What do you think?
Daddy's not here, huh?

201
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,561
- Look at us in the face.
- Look at us in the face

202
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,281
- I'm sure you've gained followers
with the tit thing.

203
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,521
- Hey.
- Quiet, eh.

204
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:45,081
- I don't like you.
- We're here because of you.

205
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:48,841
- Nobody will save you from here.
- Well, no problem, enjoy it.

206
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:51,961
- Don't touch me!
- Calm down, huh?

207
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:53,881
- Stop it! Stop it!
Hey!

208
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,921
That's what they teach you in pay schools,

209
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:02,481
to go all for one?

210
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:08,241
Pretty brave, isn't it?
All in a pack for the poor girl.

211
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:13,761
What are you?
The bravest, aren't you, athlete?

212
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,041
The one with the fattest eggs,
right?

213
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,361
Let's see it.

214
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:25,961
He's got them for quail,
he's got them for quail.

215
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:30,281
How do you make quail?
Let's see, how do you make quail?

216
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,561
- I just don't know much about birds.

217
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:36,081
- Well, how does the hen do it?
- Cocorocó.

218
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,241
- Higher.

219
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:40,041
- Cocorocó.
- Higher.

220
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:45,001
- Cocoroco.
- Cocorocó. Very good.

221
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,521
Helsinki, take these children
and this one, the first.

222
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,721
- Come on, blondie, come in.
Come on, you too.

223
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:55,961
- Wait, wait, wait.

224
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:00,841
Are you all right?

225
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,281
- Can I have another one?

226
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:06,801
- No, honey, this is not an outlet.

227
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,201
Take it off and rub it.

228
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:11,721
I'm going to take advantage too.

229
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,881
That is more than 50 hours,
going up, going down,

230
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,161
Printing money...

231
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:21,041
And a shower is necessary.

232
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:25,121
Do you know what happens to you?
What happens to you

233
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,281
is that you don't know
the potential you have,

234
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,401
Isn't that right?

235
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:32,721
You had to do really bad
to be the class loser.

236
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:36,721
You can still be prom queen, huh?

237
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,681
It's not that hard, it's like
in American movies.

238
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:42,321
where the loser gets her glasses off

239
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:45,201
and suddenly... Boom, he's a hot chick.

240
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,081
- No, I don't wear glasses.

241
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,041
- Honey, I know you're not wearing glasses.

242
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,641
But I don't know, you'll know something,
won't you?

243
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:54,641
- Dancing.

244
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:57,041
- Well, all right. And what do you dance,
what do you know how to dance?

245
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:58,881
- Classic and contemporary.

246
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,721
- Oh, yeah.

247
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,641
Another little thing,
something else you know how to do.

248
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,521
- Hunting.

249
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,281
- Hunting?
With weapons?

250
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,721
Don't tell me.
Fuck, with the goody-goody.

251
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:21,881
Well, that's scary enough,
because what you have to do

252
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,081
is for these suckers to see what
you're capable of,

253
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,961
is to show them you're not afraid.

254
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:30,921
Oh, look.

255
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:37,721
You have to wait patiently for your
moment to come.

256
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,761
You put yourself in the spotlight

257
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,521
and do something that says...

258
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:52,161
"My name is Alison Parker
and I'm the fucking boss."

259
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,361
Boom.

260
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:59,121
You say it, repeat it. Look at yourself
and repeat it, say it, say it.

261
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:00,561
Say it, come on.

262
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,721
- I'm Alison Parker and I'm the fucking boss.

263
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:09,361
- No, but good, really say it.
Really, look into your eyes,

264
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:12,641
Look at the superfemale you are.
Repeat it.

265
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:17,201
- I'm Alison Parker and I'm the fucking boss.
- You're what?

266
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:19,561
- The fucking boss.
- You're what?

267
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,521
- The fucking boss.
- You're what?

268
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,761
- The fucking boss!
- You're what?

269
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,321
- The fucking boss!
- Boom!

270
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:42,801
Have they sent anything yet?

271
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:55,961
Sorry, I'm going to make a personal call,

272
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:58,161
Can you turn down the audio?
And don't record it, okay?

273
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:33,921
Yes? Hello, Salva,
this is Raquel.

274
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:36,841
Hi, there.

275
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:42,881
Excuse me,
did I catch you at a weird time?

276
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:46,481
No, no, absurd rather, is that I was doing

277
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:49,001
some sport on the mobile bank.

278
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,881
Mobile bench?
Well, yes,

279
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,561
a device to make...
Well, it's for gymnastics.

280
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,841
Well, it didn't take long.
I just wanted to ask

281
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:01,761
if you have already chosen a place
to go for dinner tonight.

282
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:05,721
Well, honestly, not yet,
you'll see,

283
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:09,081
every time I read a restaurant review
on the internet.

284
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:11,961
I feel like seeing us in the same place
as always,

285
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,121
in the Hanoi.

286
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:14,961
Well, that's fine with me.

287
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:16,961
And we leave the experiments
for another day.

288
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:20,681
Does 9:00 sound good,
for example?

289
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:23,001
Nine o'clock, for example,
is very good.

290
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,201
All right.

291
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:30,241
- Raquel.

292
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:33,681
I have important information
about the retroxil.

293
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,561
- Listen to me, all of you,
I want you to get out of the tent again.

294
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,561
it'll only be five minutes.

295
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,561
- Hey, don't you think you're a
little paranoid?

296
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,881
- I have to remind you that we have a mole?

297
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,361
- He doesn't have to be a cop,
a lot of people pass through this tent.

298
00:21:56,521 --> 00:22:00,001
I don't know, the SAMUR,
Civil Protection, the municipal...

299
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:02,441
Even your cafeteria friend has been here.

300
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,001
- Okay.
What do you got?

301
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,961
- Like I told you,
retroxil is a medicine

302
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:15,481
used for Parkinson's,
they are experimenting with it

303
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:18,601
in some muscular dystrophies,
such as Helmer's myopathy.

304
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:23,041
It is administered intravenously.
As it is necessary to ask for it by order,

305
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:25,321
they have all patients very localized.

306
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:28,361
- Yeah. And I guess the pharmacies
will always make the same order

307
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,481
for the same sick people, right?
- Exactly.

308
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,881
But in Toledo there has been an
unusual demand,

309
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,761
in the last five months, look,
the distributor has sent

310
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,241
medicines to treat 40 patients.

311
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,361
- And there aren't 40 sick people
in Toledo.

312
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,881
- No, there are three in all
Castilla-La Mancha.

313
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,441
- Where are these pharmacies?

314
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:56,081
- They are all in... Around Illescas,
about 35 km.

315
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:59,401
- And where was the last purchase made?

316
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,761
- Look, here, in Palomeque,
on October 18th.

317
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:09,121
- Just three days before entering
the factory.

318
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,041
- They bought ten boxes of medicine.

319
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:16,201
- Get me permission from Judge Andrade.

320
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,201
and go to that pharmacy by yourself.
I want you to get

321
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,561
with all the shopping records.
And I don't know,

322
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:23,041
see if you can find anything.

323
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,921
Please don't discuss this with anyone.

324
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:27,041
- Absolutely.

325
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:31,921
By the way, Raquel.

326
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,281
You see...

327
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:41,841
I don't want you to think that because
of what I told you yesterday.

328
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:44,761
I'm having a bad time with Mari Carmen.

329
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:50,761
In fact, this very morning...
Well, we've made love.

330
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,281
Yes.

331
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:02,121
- That's good, isn't it?
- Yes, yes, yes.

332
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:06,961
- You can all come in now.

333
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,801
Arturito, I have a good surprise for you.

334
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,561
Look, I want you to know that I...

335
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:32,761
I respect any option.

336
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:37,321
I even have a homosexual brother,
he lives in Sitges and...

337
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:41,281
Well, he hasn't openly
acknowledged it yet,

338
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:43,401
but the whole family thinks he is.

339
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,801
He does pilates and...

340
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:51,321
It's actually a door I'd rather not open.

341
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:53,681
If I'm being honest with you.

342
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:58,881
What door are you talking about?
Don't understand.

343
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,041
This is the good surprise
I'm telling you about.

344
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:18,281
We talked about door another day.

345
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:22,081
- Helsinki, let them,
they'll have to talk.

346
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:46,361
I thought they killed you.

347
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,041
I swear to you that I sensed it,
that I would see you again.

348
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:02,721
And that's what gave me the strength.

349
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,081
Even in the moments when I was debating

350
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:08,881
between life and death you were there,
you never left.

351
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:50,561
This has never happened to me.

352
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:00,641
I swear I'm gonna get you out of here.

353
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,281
It is coming, isn't it?

354
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:17,001
Give me the girl's.

355
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,241
- My name is Ariadna Cascales and I feel fine,

356
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,561
physically and mentally.

357
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,601
The treatment received
by the kidnappers is good.

358
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,001
and I have no objection.

359
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:29,761
- The newsreel next
to the hostage is today's.

360
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:32,401
- A kiss for my family.
- So what's the problem?

361
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:34,481
- IT have analyzed the video,

362
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,761
it looks like they used a program to edit it.

363
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:40,561
- Are you saying that in 40 minutes
they've had time

364
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:42,241
to put special effects on it?

365
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:45,121
- We think they've superimposed
the images from the newsreel

366
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:47,521
over old images.
The quality of the video

367
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,761
doesn't allow us to give it as
real proof of life.

368
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,721
They've lowered the quality to 240
and they've done it on purpose,

369
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,881
is a bad symptom.

370
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,321
- Shots fired at the factory are front page
in all the news

371
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:02,481
of the country, press demands at least one note.

372
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:06,201
And presidency order us enter.

373
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:10,001
- I need time.
- And me, a face-lifting,

374
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:12,121
but they want us to go in now.

375
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:17,481
- Give me two hours.
If in two hours I haven't gotten

376
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:19,441
those proofs of life,
we're going in.

377
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,761
- All right.

378
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,521
Manipulating that evidence
wasn't very clever,

379
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:32,001
I'd say he's been rather foolish.

380
00:28:32,161 --> 00:28:35,201
Please, Inspector,
we can't reduce our relationship

381
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:37,601
to these dry and disqualifying messages

382
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,921
without a "how are you?,
how was your day?"

383
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:42,921
You're only going for what interests you,
don't tell me you're like that.

384
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,841
Look, frankly, I don't have time for nonsense.

385
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:48,641
Well, by the 15 seconds it takes,
our lives aren't going to change.

386
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:52,441
Tell me,
let's say you know someone

387
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,601
and you sleep with him.,

388
00:28:56,921 --> 00:29:00,121
Are you the kind that wakes up
in the middle of the night

389
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:03,401
and escapes without even knowing his name?

390
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:04,641
Do these things fill you up?

391
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:07,281
Well, look, I'd really love to do that.

392
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:11,361
Yes, but I'm programmed to do other things first,

393
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:16,121
like, I don't know, chat, laugh,
tell my life,

394
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:19,561
drinking coffee, going for a walk,
going to the cinema, dancing...

395
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:22,441
Without that order of things the truth
is that I don't see myself

396
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:25,321
going to bed with no one.
Call me old fashioned, if you like.

397
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,641
No, I won't.

398
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:30,761
The truth is that I, too,
share that same order of priorities,

399
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:31,961
but I would add one more:

400
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,201
go to a karaoke.

401
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:38,241
Call me weird, but I can't help it,

402
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,481
I like them a lot, I love them.
But I don't want to keep you any longer.

403
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:44,041
Tell me.
It's very simple,

404
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,201
these proofs of life have no value,

405
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:48,241
so we have no choice but going in.

406
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,081
And we can do it to watch quietly

407
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:54,321
or to free those people with gas
and all the artillery.

408
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:56,601
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

409
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,641
You're asking me to let you in.

410
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,041
You choose: or I send you the tanks

411
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,761
or we'll have a coffee
you and I and show me

412
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,121
all hostages alive.

413
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:11,801
I will be delighted to receive you.

414
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:15,681
I don't know if we'll get to karaoke,
but I can't refuse.

415
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:26,081
Raquel, Raquel,
I'm not gonna let you in there.

416
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,881
- I give the orders here, not you.

417
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,721
- Good.
- Ángel.

418
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:33,881
I'm sorry.

419
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,521
Look, right now I think there's
more work out there

420
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:38,801
than in here.

421
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,761
Besides, you're the only person I can trust.

422
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:49,121
All right, gentlemen, ladies.

423
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:52,041
We're going in.

424
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:13,681
Raise your hands.

425
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:19,481
Proceed.

426
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:25,641
The legs.

427
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:31,561
Where is the Profesor?

428
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:38,841
- He asks me to excuse him,
but for reasons of discretion,

429
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,201
he cannot be present.

430
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:43,321
Think that his face isn't
on all the covers yet,

431
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,441
like ours.

432
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:46,961
No weapons.

433
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:50,561
Río, you're up, do the honors.

434
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:59,041
Excuse me, we must be meticulous.

435
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:14,761
Raquel...

436
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:18,521
I know they say the police aren't stupid,

437
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:20,601
but sometimes it does.
Did you really think

438
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:23,441
that you could pass with a wire?
- And you believed that my people

439
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:25,121
wasn't going to take care of my safety?

440
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,321
- Tokio, search the inspector again,

441
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:31,401
but this time put a little more
of that enthusiasm you know.

442
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:11,161
He just surprise me,
the police with the latest technology,

443
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,001
the perianal microphone.

444
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:16,441
Get rid of this.

445
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:18,641
Are you finished?

446
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:21,601
Come with me, if you would be so kind.

447
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:25,641
"At that moment Río was paralyzed.

448
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:32,641
Lightning, that's what his mother
used to call him as a child,

449
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:35,121
when he spent his summer
afternoons running.

450
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,561
He said he was going to be an Olympic champion,

451
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,201
but he traded the sport for the consoles

452
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,681
and outdoor plans for the risk

453
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:43,881
to end up in a prison."

454
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:48,161
Judge Andrade, this is Deputy
Inspector Rubio,

455
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,801
of the hostage situation
at the Fábrica Nacional

456
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:54,121
de Moneda y Timbre.
Look, I'm calling you because we need

457
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:57,241
a search and seizure order for a pharmacy in Toledo.

458
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:00,441
Yes.

459
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:03,761
Yeah, we're on the trail
of one of the muggers.

460
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:09,841
All right.

461
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:18,281
Okay. Look, we get
the feeling that someone

462
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:20,521
is passing information
to them from outside

463
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:22,761
and I would ask for absolute discretion,
please.

464
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:28,201
Okay. Okay, all right,
thank you very much.

465
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:29,841
Goodbye, goodbye.

466
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:39,041
If you're looking for Raquel,
she's not here.

467
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:42,641
Eh... No, no, the truth is that
I was just coming for a drink.

468
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:46,441
"In this way, the police fence narrows

469
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,001
about the band of muggers who last Friday

470
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:51,081
assaulted the Fábrica Nacional..."
Forgive me,

471
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:53,561
How's the kidnapping thing going?
Because I've heard

472
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:56,121
that there's been gunfire and it
looks like it's getting

473
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:57,241
a bit long, isn't it?

474
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:01,121
No, no, it's about to end.
Oh, yeah?

475
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:03,041
Yeah.
Oh, well, I'm glad,

476
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,721
I am very happy because...

477
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:07,601
Oh, my God, I can imagine how much
they are suffering,

478
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,761
those poor people, the hostages I mean.

479
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,401
Not to mention you.

480
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:22,001
Do you work near here?
Yes, yes, right next door.

481
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,081
Ah, as Raquel told me she was unemployed...

482
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,921
It's just that a few months ago
I lost my job

483
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:33,321
and then now I'm trying to raise

484
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:34,641
my own company.
I see

485
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:37,921
Well, it's a small company.
You are an entrepreneur.

486
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:39,041
Yes, it is.

487
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:41,121
And what is the company about?

488
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,441
Cider.

489
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,401
What do you say?
Organic cider.

490
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,321
My mother was from Oviedo.
It can't be.

491
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,641
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,521
Well, I make it myself in a workshop
I have there.

493
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,801
Instead of sucking on milk,
I sucked on cider.

494
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:02,841
Well, yes, my grandfather had an apple field,

495
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:05,601
a small field. And well,
I've got into it.

496
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:08,561
And you have the workshop nearby?
Yes, very close.

497
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:11,281
I'd love to try it.
Of course, that's done.

498
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:14,721
Look, one day I'll bring you a bottle.
Oh, thank you.

499
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:27,961
The Profesor told me he asked for coffee.

500
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:31,641
I've brought it decaffeinated,
so you don't stay awake..

501
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:42,441
Let's start with the proofs of life.

502
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:43,681
Proceed!

503
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:46,801
To open our mouths here we have
Arturo Román,

504
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:48,801
director of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

505
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:51,041
- Are you going to bring me the hostages
one at a time?

506
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:55,481
- That's it, so you don't get confused
about keeping score.

507
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:08,281
Arturo, this lady is Raquel Murillo,

508
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,081
the inspector who ordered you shot.

509
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:14,761
But don't be scared,
we've thoroughly searched her

510
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:18,121
and is unarmed.
Please be gentle with him,

511
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:20,761
Arturo is really a very sensitive man

512
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:23,841
and he's been a little traumatized.

513
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:26,201
- How are you, Arturo?

514
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:28,441
I've had better days.

515
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:33,281
I want to apologize on behalf of the police

516
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:35,561
and my own, of course.

517
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,441
It was an unforgivable mistake
and I hope you get better soon.

518
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:46,201
Good.

519
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:49,681
You can go on to the next one.
- No, don't be impatient, please.

520
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,841
On top of that, we have the deference
that they can be interviewed,

521
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:53,961
everyone.

522
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:56,321
- I'm sorry, but I can't lose all day here.

523
00:37:56,881 --> 00:38:00,121
- It's a shame,
I was starting to get my hopes up.

524
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:11,801
I have scissors.

525
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:14,321
How?

526
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,481
I took it because I was afraid,
but with it I'm in danger.

527
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,721
What are you talking about?

528
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:21,641
What are you doing? Hide that,
you're going to put us all

529
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,241
in a good mess.
No, I don't want it,

530
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,081
I'm going to throw it right here.
Put it away.

531
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:26,641
I don't want it. Please.

532
00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:29,801
Give it to me, give it to me.
Arturito,

533
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,201
Walk with me.

534
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,161
What were those gunshots?

535
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:53,361
Please

536
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:09,161
They're going to kill us al

537
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:12,441
One by one

538
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:16,281
"One at a time, all the hostages would go

539
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:17,801
in front of the inspector."

540
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:19,841
Would you rate the treatment you
received as good?

541
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:20,961
- I can't complain.

542
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:23,041
"As the children pass by to see
the Three Wise Men

543
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,361
in a shopping mall."

544
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:27,361
Have you been able to sleep?
- I was able to rest.

545
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:37,321
This one reminds me of my aunt.

546
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:40,681
She's dead, though.

547
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:44,241
Have you had your coffee?

548
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:04,201
I like this one that's coming,
it's super quiet.

549
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:22,561
Don't even think about saying anything
about the gunshot, okay?

550
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:27,641
- Mónica?
Yes.

551
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:29,961
Are you all right?

552
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:33,001
Well, I'm a little dizzy.

553
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,041
Because I'm pregnant.

554
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:42,041
Excuse the question,
but were you the one who asked

555
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:44,401
an abortion pill?
Yes.

556
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:48,921
It was me, yes,
but I changed my mind.

557
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:54,801
I don't know if I'm going
to get out of here and...

558
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,841
And if I go out, I don't know if I'll be able
to take care of that child,

559
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:02,081
but I'd like to move
on with my pregnancy.

560
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:08,601
It will be.

561
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:14,121
No matter how hard things get,

562
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:18,801
children always get ahead,
the problem comes

563
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:20,321
when we get older.

564
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:32,281
- If there's one thing I know, Inspector,
it's about women and children,

565
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:36,081
so don't worry, mom's gonna be well
taken care of.

566
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:37,761
Pass the next one, please.

567
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:00,241
Mónica, are you all right?

568
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,401
You've been taken in front of
the inspector too?

569
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:06,441
What did they tell you?
Well, if I was fine,

570
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:08,721
that if I rested well.
And they have asked me

571
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:12,001
To not say anything about the wound.
They are looking for proof of life.

572
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,441
Luckily, we're all fine Arturo.
No, fortunately not,

573
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:16,801
the opposite, if the proof of life fails,

574
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:19,121
they'd realize something's not working.

575
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:21,641
They would enter,
they would have no choice but to enter.

576
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:29,361
Listen to me, Alison.

577
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:33,281
Only you can get us out of here.
You have to disappear.

578
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:35,081
as long as the proof of life lasts.

579
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:37,081
There is a well hidden safe.
No.

580
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:39,721
All you have to do is get inside
and lock yourself inside,

581
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:42,241
there is a numerical sequence.
But I can't do that.

582
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:45,641
You're their safe-conduct. If you don't
show up on the proof of life,

583
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:48,841
they'll have no choice but to come after you,
they have no choice.

584
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,201
You have to, it's very simple.

585
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:57,201
29175232, can you do it?
29137...

586
00:42:57,401 --> 00:42:59,441
29175.
2917...

587
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:02,481
5.
29175372.

588
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:05,841
29175232.
29137...

589
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,961
29175...
Arturo, leave her.

590
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:11,281
Leave it, don't you see
we don't stand a chance?

591
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:14,081
I have a shot in the leg, you...
Everything is going to be fine, listen to me.

592
00:43:15,881 --> 00:43:19,441
I got some scissors.
Listen, if they attack you,

593
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,361
attack with it.
What are you saying, Arturo?

594
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:22,641
Listen to me.
No...

595
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:32,761
I was told your wound opened.

596
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:35,961
It's just that I tried not to limp
so they wouldn't notice

597
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:37,721
and I think I've dropped a stitch.

598
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,481
Is it all right with you
if we see it?

599
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:41,801
Okay.

600
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:49,241
Do you need her to undress?
How else can I be cured?

601
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:00,641
See those doubloons over there?

602
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:04,841
They were found in the stomach
of a Spanish sailor.

603
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:06,561
Mummified.

604
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,121
Apparently, the captain discovered
that he was stealing

605
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,521
part of the cargo they brought in
from the Indies.

606
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,561
He made him swallow all the coins
he had seized, one by one,

607
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,921
until he drowned.

608
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:23,041
- Imagine if we applied the same
punishment to you.

609
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:26,041
- We'd end up like a built-in wardrobe

610
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:27,321
With six doors.

611
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:35,441
You're very funny, Inspector.

612
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:37,601
- I didn't come here to make jokes, Fonollosa,

613
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,641
I still have four cops to see,

614
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:42,361
11 security members and three teenagers,

615
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:43,761
including Alison Parker.

616
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:46,561
- Please, you have to decompress,
don't be impatient.

617
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:50,081
Dessert always stays for the end.

618
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:53,241
- Yeah, but dessert's taking too long.

619
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:55,561
and I'm afraid my digestion
will be cut off.

620
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,601
I want to see Parker now.

621
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:00,041
- She's getting ready.

622
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,001
You know how teenagers are,
always so vain.

623
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:07,121
Deep down, I think it's that insecurity

624
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:09,681
that accompanies certain women
throughout their lives.

625
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:15,881
What about dogs?

626
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,801
Helsinki is taking them out of the cage.

627
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:18,961
Get up.

628
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:25,361
Happy faces, your boss has come
to see you.

629
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:26,921
Come on, upstairs.

630
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:30,841
"In that silence Inspector Murillo could hear

631
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:33,401
machines at full capacity making banknotes

632
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:35,641
and she realized we'd cheated on her,

633
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:38,281
that the shots had been faked

634
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:40,601
and that his visit to the museum
had only served

635
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:43,121
to give us two hours longer than if she'd

636
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:44,281
been outside.

637
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:47,721
we had won 16 million euros more.

638
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:51,561
The Profesor was right, in this heist.

639
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:54,201
the bloody time was gold."

640
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:57,921
In our first class I told you that somehow

641
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:59,321
we're not gonna steal,

642
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:02,841
we're not gonna steal anything from
other people, are we?

643
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,321
All right.

644
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:08,681
Well, I lied to you.

645
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:12,161
Because there is something we're
going to steal,

646
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:16,521
we're going to steal police time.

647
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:19,441
We're going to put crumbs in it,

648
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,641
they're going to sting and we're
going to lead them to dead ends.

649
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:26,201
And they won't be able to concentrate
on their main objective,

650
00:46:26,361 --> 00:46:30,241
which is to get us all out of there.
And when we have their time

651
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,961
and their attention,

652
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:34,961
we just have to dilate it.

653
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:38,721
Stretch it, like a piece of gum.

654
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:41,881
While the machines are running
on a piece-rate basis.

655
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:45,441
They are not fools,

656
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:50,081
at some point they'll realize that
this is all a game,

657
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,801
which is nothing more than
a diversionary maneuver

658
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:54,721
to keep printing money.

659
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:59,441
Even so, they can do nothing,

660
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:03,721
because they're obligated
to solve the kidnapping

661
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:05,041
with zero victims.

662
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,161
"It seemed easy.

663
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:12,001
Maybe with another inspector in charge,

664
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:15,201
but Raquel was a woman in a man's world,

665
00:47:16,161 --> 00:47:18,201
a single mother in the middle of the
divorce,

666
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,961
a girl who had endured her husband's
mistreatment.

667
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:26,721
And there, in front of Berlín,
she felt comfortable,

668
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:30,121
as a teacher in front of her rebellious
students.

669
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,881
He wasn't going to stand by with
her arms crossed

670
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,401
while he was teasing her."

671
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:42,481
I've given you approach stitches,
so you don't have to sew again.

672
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:43,601
Better.

673
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:45,641
What's the matter, you're a surgeon now, or what?

674
00:47:46,801 --> 00:47:50,281
I mean... You've at least
washed your hands, haven't you?

675
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,281
Of course, Arturito.
To give you a slap

676
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:55,161
with the scent of your fucking mother.

677
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:58,441
I'm getting a little dizzy,
if I could go where I was before,

678
00:47:58,601 --> 00:47:59,881
to rest and that...
Yes.

679
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,761
Listen to me, Alison,
this is non-negotiable.

680
00:48:20,761 --> 00:48:24,041
I need you to do it,
I need you to do it for everyone.

681
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,761
Do you really want to keep being
the sack of shit

682
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:29,201
of your classmates?
What do you know?

683
00:48:29,361 --> 00:48:32,121
What do I know?
I've seen them laugh at you,

684
00:48:32,721 --> 00:48:34,761
how they murmur behind your back,
I've seen them.

685
00:48:34,921 --> 00:48:37,281
I've seen how they treat you,
like a fucking loser.

686
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:43,321
And you can change everything,
today, now, it's in your hand.

687
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:46,761
You have the ability to change
your destiny,

688
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:50,041
but you have to follow my plan,
okay?

689
00:48:57,081 --> 00:48:58,841
Your general condition is good, then.

690
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:02,761
- Yes, you could say that.

691
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:08,361
- Helsinki, please escort him to
his quarters.

692
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:14,201
- All right, I think I've already seen
all the hostages

693
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:15,641
except Alison Parker.

694
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,961
I understand it's her turn now, isn't it?

695
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:25,361
Or what?

696
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:28,361
Are you going to handcuff us?

697
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:32,681
Hey, please, ladies, peace.

698
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,001
It's a little early for mud and bikinis.

699
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:41,681
- Look, since I've been in here,
I've only heard you say stupid things.

700
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:46,681
I was expecting something more substantial
from a man who has left...

701
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:48,201
What, seven months to live?

702
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,201
- What is she talking about?

703
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:54,201
What the hell's going on?

704
00:49:54,601 --> 00:49:57,881
He has Helmer's myopathy,
a degenerative disease

705
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:01,081
very aggressive, with a life expectancy

706
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:04,081
from 14 to 25 months.

707
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,521
Possibly his muscles have already
begun to tighten,

708
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:13,321
which translates into spasms,
hand tremors...

709
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:19,361
Haven't you noticed that it's getting
harder and harder to hold the gun?

710
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:37,641
I screwed up.

711
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:43,281
I thought there were no secrets between you,
that you were friends.

712
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:48,961
I want to see Alison Parker,
now.

713
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:53,841
- Can I go to the bathroom?
Please, it's urgent.

714
00:50:56,801 --> 00:50:57,761
- Hurry.

715
00:51:03,121 --> 00:51:05,241
Cóndor three, any movement?

716
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:08,441
- Main entrance clear, sir.
- All right.

717
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:19,441
Mr. Berlín.

718
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:22,321
May I have a word with you?

719
00:51:43,481 --> 00:51:45,481
I wanted to tell you that I feel much better,

720
00:51:45,641 --> 00:51:47,681
that I'm less nervous and I'd like to go down

721
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,121
with the rest of the hostages.

722
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:51,521
- You're not well here,
do you have a complaint?

723
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:54,601
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

724
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:58,801
That's why I might as well collaborate
on some of the tasks

725
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:00,961
you're handing out.
- Well, Ariadna,

726
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,721
What could you do to help?
- Anything, anything at all.

727
00:52:04,201 --> 00:52:07,561
Cooking, ground chopping...
I think you are building

728
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:08,721
a tunnel or...

729
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:12,081
- Can you get a little closer?

730
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:17,161
To shatter with those hands would be a sin.

731
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:20,361
And besides, we already have people for that.

732
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:23,121
We also have people to print,

733
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:27,801
to move the coils...
Actually we have people for everything.

734
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,161
- Last night he took Silvia
and we heard the gunshots.

735
00:52:35,681 --> 00:52:38,241
I can't stand it here anymore,
please, I need to get out.

736
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:40,441
- Everybody.

737
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:44,681
Anguish, stress, anxiety...

738
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:51,641
Me, for example, right now have the certainty

739
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,321
that I'm not getting out of here alive.

740
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:58,121
Me, at your age, also believed that
I could eat the world,

741
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:01,921
I wasn't going to look back on the bloody life

742
00:53:02,081 --> 00:53:04,401
and that I would never regret anything.

743
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,721
But one day something stops you,

744
00:53:08,681 --> 00:53:09,721
suddenly.

745
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:12,801
Yeah. And it's best that whatever
Suddenly stops you

746
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:16,241
Is that you've been kicked out of work
or your apartment repossessed,

747
00:53:17,401 --> 00:53:18,921
and not the GEOS shooting.

748
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:22,801
What's going on is that I've already
been suddenly stop by a gunshot.

749
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:27,841
Specifically one straight to my boyfriend's heart.

750
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:33,281
Get out there and tell everyone.

751
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:36,201
That I don't feel anything anymore.

752
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:40,401
And they can come in for me,

753
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:42,481
shooting.

754
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:45,961
Units stand by for intervention, sir.

755
00:53:46,161 --> 00:53:48,921
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- Waiting for instructions.

756
00:53:50,321 --> 00:53:53,201
When Mussolini was losing World War Il.

757
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:56,361
and a huge black cloud prevented
him from thinking,

758
00:53:57,161 --> 00:54:00,641
he realized that the only thing
that could lift his spirit

759
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:01,761
was sex.

760
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:07,001
He had a prostitute set up
in a room next to his office.

761
00:54:08,561 --> 00:54:10,521
From time to time he went to see her

762
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:13,161
to give him back his joy.

763
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:17,761
- I can help you solve your problems.

764
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,641
- Do you think I could be with
a woman who came to me

765
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:22,081
against his will,

766
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:25,041
if I noticed her contempt for me,
is that it?

767
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:29,001
- I really want to.

768
00:54:30,761 --> 00:54:31,721
Try me.

769
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,321
Try me, Mr. Berlín.

770
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:36,281
- I don't even know if
I want to be with you.

771
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,401
Because I've noticed you.

772
00:54:42,401 --> 00:54:44,241
Why don't you dance a little
so I can see you?

773
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:50,441
Dance.

774
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:04,201
"For Ariadna, surrendering to the
kidnapper in command

775
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:06,321
was the most certain way to save
her life.

776
00:55:07,401 --> 00:55:09,601
What she didn't know was that
she wasn't in danger yet.

777
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,601
and that it was as desperate
as the escape attempt

778
00:55:13,761 --> 00:55:15,441
of Alison,

779
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:19,721
who had the holy ovaries of trying
to escape from Nairobi.

780
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:24,921
Maybe that's what gives you despair,
ovaries.

781
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,281
And the absolute determination to hold
on to life

782
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:29,841
like two fiery bitches."

783
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:05,441
You mother fucker!
Alison!

784
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:07,201
Alison!

785
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:13,641
Alison!

786
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:29,601
Ah, ah!

787
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:09,281
Hello, Salva.

788
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,081
You see, I was around here,
around the area, and...

789
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:15,601
Well, I saw you come in,
and I said, "Will it be Salva?"

790
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:16,721
And yes, it is you.

791
00:57:17,361 --> 00:57:18,681
Do you mind if I come in?

792
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:22,161
Now?
Yes, now.

793
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:25,561
Sure, come in.

794
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,401
That's a hell of a bar you've got here,
isn't it?

795
00:57:35,281 --> 00:57:37,681
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I can't wait to try

796
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:39,441
that cider you promised me.

797
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:42,321
Of course I do, man,
right now.

798
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,441
Thank you.
Cheers.

799
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:03,161
I told you I'm an amateur,
I'm not a professional...

800
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:06,721
No, it's not bad at all, man.
Well, a bit bitter.

801
00:58:07,761 --> 00:58:08,721
Listen to me.

802
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:13,121
How's it going with Raquel?

803
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:18,161
Because you're dating, aren't you?
Well, let's see,

804
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:20,441
going out, going out, no, we are...

805
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:24,321
We've talked once and now
we have a date,

806
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:25,641
that's true, but...
I see.

807
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:28,121
And there is affinity between us,
especially on my part,

808
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:30,401
I consider Raquel a very charismatic woman.

809
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:33,001
But come on, we barely know each other.

810
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:35,681
If you're going to give her that juice,
you'd better perfect it..

811
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:39,481
Yeah, if you give her three glasses of that,
you will let go of her stomach.

812
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,801
It wouldn't be a very ideal date,
would it?

813
00:58:42,961 --> 00:58:45,241
Sure, sure.
Well, thank you very much for the advice.

814
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:47,561
It must be because your apples
are drying out there.

815
00:58:47,721 --> 00:58:48,721
Oh, yeah?
Yes.

816
00:58:49,081 --> 00:58:50,761
There's a lot of moisture in this place,
isn't there?

817
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:13,241
Silene, without that microphone
they can't know if I'm okay or not.

818
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:17,441
Assault units two and three prevented.

819
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,601
- Nine minutes.
In position.

820
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:24,961
I should put a stove in anyway.
Well, they can rot you.

821
00:59:25,121 --> 00:59:27,281
You should find another place.

822
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:44,441
Look,

823
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:47,401
I have to get out of here to
avoid a massacre.

824
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:49,321
with or without proof of life,
you understand?

825
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:54,921
Have a seat.

826
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:57,601
Four minutes.

827
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:59,841
Do I speak fucking Chinese or what's going on?
Sit down.

828
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,881
Alison, Alison, Alison.

829
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:12,361
10 000 m2 is here, huh?
I don't know where the fuck it is.

830
01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:17,001
Excuse me.

831
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:18,721
Yes?

832
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:24,641
I'll call the Profesor,
keep looking for her.

833
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,881
Are you ready? Good.
Does it have the judge's signature?

834
01:00:31,321 --> 01:00:33,481
Okay, fine,
I'll be right there.

835
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:34,601
Thank you.

836
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:37,361
You'll excuse me, duty calls.

837
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:38,961
What a pity.

838
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:42,921
Don't you want to take a bottle with you?
No, thank you.

839
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:50,201
No, I don't pay any attention to it.
After all, who calls a landline?

840
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:51,321
Yes.

841
01:01:00,481 --> 01:01:03,081
Second floor, office 17, inside the safe.

842
01:01:16,321 --> 01:01:18,001
Fuching child.
- No!

843
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:30,161
Alison, are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

844
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,561
- We didn't have much time,
if there's anything, tell me.

845
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:34,961
Weren't you in a hurry?
Well, get the fuck out.

846
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:36,081
Río, with me.

847
01:01:56,641 --> 01:01:59,281
What's up, Pilar?
What, did you find something?

848
01:01:59,921 --> 01:02:02,801
- Yes, there was a print.
- And?

849
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,721
- And the print doesn't match with the cops

850
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:09,761
that patrol it.
- What do you mean, it doesn't match,

851
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:12,321
Did you put it in a database?
- Yes, I have,

852
01:02:12,481 --> 01:02:15,161
but there's no match,
that print is unrecorded

853
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:16,801
in Spain.
- I see.

854
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:19,601
Look, do me a favor.

855
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:23,161
Check it with the fingerprints on this spoon,
okay?

856
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:26,041
When you get the results, call me,
no matter what time it is.

857
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,201
- Done.
- Thank you.

858
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:30,161
- Where did that spoon come from?
- Hey, Alberto.

859
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:33,121
- Did you get the cutlery from
the kidnappers?

860
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:36,121
- No, it's from another source,
a hunch.

861
01:02:36,281 --> 01:02:37,961
- You know we can't analyze anything

862
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,641
which is not sealed and documented
where it comes from.

863
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:42,881
- Yeah, but I'm asking this as a
personal favor.

864
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:47,921
- Fuck, you say nothing, Ángelito.
We found out more about the kidnapping

865
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:49,361
on TV than from you.

866
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:54,881
Don't worry, when we get the analysis,

867
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:57,001
we'll call you, okay?
- Thank you.

868
01:02:58,361 --> 01:02:59,401
- What about Raquel?

869
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:01,801
Is she getting better?

870
01:03:02,921 --> 01:03:04,961
- Yes, she's getting better, bit by bit.

871
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:17,121
Companions, after a severe reflection

872
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:21,561
I wanted to apologize for not being

873
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:25,401
completely honest with you.
The inspector was right.

874
01:03:29,841 --> 01:03:31,481
I have a degenerative disease.

875
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:35,441
Pretty bastard.

876
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,841
And my days are numbered,
but it's not my intention

877
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:44,321
to make you sad.

878
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,561
And much less pity me.

879
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:51,841
After all, it's a disease.

880
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:55,161
which suffers one out
of every 100 000 people.

881
01:03:57,321 --> 01:03:59,041
And that makes me someone special.

882
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:01,801
What I want is to invite you to celebrate.

883
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:02,921
Río.

884
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:15,561
We're all going to die.

885
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:25,841
That's why I drink.

886
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:30,121
Because we are alive.

887
01:04:34,721 --> 01:04:36,961
And because the plan is going perfectly.

888
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:44,441
To life.

889
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,001
And for the plan.

890
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:14,161
Hannibal Cortés is the weakest
link in the chain.

891
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:17,481
That mic wasn't going to pass a search,

892
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,601
that's why I told the scientist to place a message

893
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:22,841
into it.

894
01:05:23,001 --> 01:05:25,281
- And how do we know that kid saw the video?

895
01:05:27,601 --> 01:05:30,241
Hello, son.
We've hired a very good lawyer

896
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:32,281
and I got you a collaboration act

897
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:33,961
with justice.

898
01:05:34,561 --> 01:05:36,961
If Hannibal Cortés surrender,
it will mean

899
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:38,721
that our plan works.

900
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:42,241
We've also talked to the police

901
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:46,121
and they say that if you turn yourself in
and agree to help

902
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:48,801
to the investigation,
the judge will grant you

903
01:05:48,961 --> 01:05:52,641
a favorable sentence,
you wouldn't spend a year in jail.

904
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:55,401
We're doing everything we can from here

905
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:58,041
so you can be okay when you
get out of there,

906
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:02,281
because you don't belong there, Lightning.
Think about it, please, Lightning.

907
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:07,041
Think about it,
you can still back up, honey.

908
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:10,321
Lightning, we're still in time.

909
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:25,201
Tell me, what is it?
- Are you coming to dinner?

910
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:29,081
- No, I don't think I'll make it to dinner,
I've got a business at a pharmacy.

911
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:32,001
- I'm waiting for you, I don't care.
- No, honey, it's not in Madrid,

912
01:06:32,161 --> 01:06:34,001
is in Toledo, in a village,
in Palomeque.

913
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:36,041
I'll call you back.

914
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,041
- Help, please, we just got mugged.

915
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:44,521
- Don't worry, I'm a cop.

916
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:51,001
- He just wanted the records of
purchases without prescriptions,

917
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:55,401
accounting, inventories
and sales books as well.

918
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,401
"And as in chess, there are occasions

919
01:07:01,561 --> 01:07:03,721
where, in order to win, you have to sacrifice

920
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:04,961
one of your pieces.

921
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:07,881
In this case, one of the most valuable,

922
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:10,161
our Trojan horse.

923
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,401
The Profesor had put Ángel in a
fucking situation

924
01:07:21,561 --> 01:07:22,921
when he visited that pharmacy,

925
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,081
a situation that would
bring him down to hell."

926
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:32,001
Raquel, listen, there was a guy
in the pharmacy before me.

927
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:35,161
No, I don't know,
I don't know how that happened,

928
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:36,921
only you and I knew.

929
01:07:39,561 --> 01:07:40,761
"And that's how it happened.

930
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:44,681
With great pain in his heart,
when Angelito

931
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:48,761
stuck his nose in the hangar,
the Profesor decided to sacrifice him."

932
01:07:57,081 --> 01:07:58,921
until when are we going to keep calling

933
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:01,201
each other formally?
When you look at me

934
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:03,161
under the table.

935
01:08:11,761 --> 01:08:13,081
Dirt!

936
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:17,561
Could you put your hand on the fire

937
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:18,681
by your deputy inspector?

938
01:08:21,761 --> 01:08:23,721
Try to hide, because if I see you,

939
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,201
I'll shoot you in the head.

940
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:30,081
Do you know how they say in my village
two men make love?

941
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:31,841
Comb for the inside.

942
01:08:33,641 --> 01:08:35,801
I am Aníbal Cortés,
what do you want?

943
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:38,081
- I want you to tell me the Profesor's name.

944
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:41,401
- I think it's time to have a friendly chat.

945
01:08:41,561 --> 01:08:42,641
with Alison Parker.

946
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:47,481
The lives of 67 people are in your hands.

947
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:51,441
Suárez, put him the handcuffs
and get him out of here!

948
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:54,401
- She's crazy, put the handcuffs on me!
- Put the handcuffs on him.

949
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:55,561
and get him out of here!

950
01:09:07,201 --> 01:09:09,761
You're a bitch, a selfish,
obsessive bitch.

951
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:11,481
You're a fucking bitch!

952
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:21,161
Turn on the light.

953
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:28,001
Stop!

954
01:09:29,641 --> 01:09:30,881
And we're gonna go get them.
