After five years in hell,

I killed him. The police officer.
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,368
Because you were
overdosed on Mirakuru;

00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,250
you didn't remember, and I was hoping
that you never would.

for this company.

I just did.

00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,886
to a little thing
on his chest that goes, "Boom!"

324
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,058
So what do you
want, then?!

325
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,758
Not much.

326
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,027
Just...You.

327
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,727
Never going
to happen.

328
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,129
Such a party pooper.

329

[Beeping]

331
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:47,605
I never thought
I'd be happy to see you!

332
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:58,252
Roy. Hey!

333
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:01,023
Why don't you go home, man?
It's been a long night.

334
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:04,230
She took me out.
It shouldn't have happened.

335
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:05,934
[Sighs] You're not
at your best.

336
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,536
I'm fine.

337
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,243
Looks like you weren't
the only person that Carrie stalked.

338
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:16,944
She was put
on limited duty

339
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:18,913
after becoming obsessed
with her partner.

340
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:21,449
The department sent
her to St. Walker's for a psych eval.

341
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:23,785
She quit the force
a little bit after.

342
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,220
- Where's Felicity?
- She's working tonight.

343
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:27,659
She said she told you.

344
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:31,166
Yes, she did.

345
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:33,635
Oliver, you ok?

346
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,971
I know this can't be easy,
with Felicity spending

347
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,098
so much time with Palmer.

348
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,242
I'm fine.

349
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,579
Where you going?

350
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,315
The psychiatrist
that SCPD sent Cutter to.

351
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:43,784
- You need back up?
- No.

352
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,820
I've got it.

353
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:02,542
Hey.

354
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:03,743
Like what you've done
to the place.

355
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:04,977
Is everything all right?

356
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:06,345
Yeah, yeah, I was just in the neighborhood.

357
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:08,046
Thought I would stop by

358
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:09,481
and check out your new sign.

359
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,883
Oh, yeah.

360
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,652
Phew.

361
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,488
[Chuckles]

362
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,357
Wow, that's a nice dress.

363
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,826
Yeah, it's
really, really,

364
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:21,496
really nice.

365
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,034
Ray lent it to me
for a work dinner.

366
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:27,039
Yeah, some...work dinner.

367
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,674
- You and Ray.
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,475
Doesn't seem that platonic.

369
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:35,214
Actually, it has Oliver
twisted up in knots.

370
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:38,248
Well, Oliver
made his choice.

371
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:39,999
We both know that
was the wrong choice.

372
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,389
And did Oliver
say that?

373
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:45,329
Oh, yeah, because Oliver's just great
at expressing his emotions.

374
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,500
He would rather go ten rounds
with the League of Assassins

375
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:49,304
than ever say that.

376
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:51,440
But this thing
with you and Palmer,

377
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,508
it's, um, it's messing
with his head, Felicity,

378
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,480
and...that's really dangerous.

379
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,688
I told you, there is no
me and Palmer.

380
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,191
But if there were,

381
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,193
and if Oliver had
a problem with it,

382
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:06,630
then Oliver should be the one
to say something.

383
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,700
Ok.

384
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,972
Good night.

385
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:28,427
- Dr. Pressnall--
- Oh, my god!

386
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:29,896
I'm not here
to hurt you.

387
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:30,898
What do you want?!

388
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,266
To talk about
Carrie Cutter.

389
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:34,234
I can't.

Doctor-patient privilege.
Just please, get out!

391
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:40,078
Your patient killed a man,
kidnapped another,

392
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,414
and I'm trying to stop her before
she hurts anyone else.

393
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,284
To do that, I need
to understand her.

394
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:48,652
[Exhales]
Please.

395
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,488
I can only diagnose her.

396
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,325
Attachment disorder,

397
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,127
the inability to form

398
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,297
real, lasting relationships.

399
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,401
They push everyone away,

400
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:04,937
and fixate
on a single person.

401
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,308
Someone they feel mirrors
their emotional state.

402
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,778
How do I stop her?

403
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,379
Give her the connection
that she craves--

404
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:16,979
honesty, sincerity...

405
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,314
If you lie to her,

406
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:21,316
she'll know.

407
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:23,319
Thank you.

408
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:27,855
If you'll permit
a professional observation...

409
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:30,857
you could use
a little therapy yourself.

410
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,459
What gives you
that impression?

411
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,560
You mean,
apart from the mask

412
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:36,394
and the Robin Hood costume?

Oliver: Shouldn't we
get out and look around

414
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,712
or, I don't know,
something?

415
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:54,250
In this place,
at this hour?

416
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:56,854
That's a very efficient way
to get yourself killed.

417
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,356
Feel free.

418

What?

422
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,638
Maseo called me that
before he left,

423
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,441
and I looked it up, but it wasn't in my
Chinese dictionary.

424
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:18,244
Because
it's Japanese.

425
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:21,113
It means
"foreigner."

426
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,883
Outsider.

427
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,885
You.

428
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:28,588
It means you, too.

429
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,858
You're Japanese,
living in Hong Kong.

430
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:37,101
Sorry.

431
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:41,206
Why did you
leave Japan?

432
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,880
It wasn't safe
for us there.

433
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:47,549
Why?

434
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,553
We upset some
very powerful,

435
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:54,719
very dangerous men.

436
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,188
Who?

437
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,393
You ask a lot
of questions.

Who's that?

They control this port.

442
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:12,809
So they know what
happened to Maseo.

443
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:15,643
I don't know.

444

to find out.

You look beautiful.

I think it's the dress.

00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,484
The dress is actually
missing something.

457
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,855
Oh, no, I forgot
to do up the zipper again?

458
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,325
I always do that.

459
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,695
Oh, no, I can't wear that.

460
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:11,362
I'm not even sure
I'm supposed to be looking at it.

461
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:14,297
Well, I had to put down
a $10,000 security deposit

462
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,531
just to borrow it
for the evening,

463
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,165
so one of us should wear it.

464
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,932
And diamonds aren't
really my thing, so.

465
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,566
I appreciate it,
but I think I would

466
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:25,338
feel strange wearing
a million dollar necklace.

467
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,709
Oh, don't worry.

468
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,311
It's not worth
a million dollars.

469
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:33,212
Ahh.

470
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:35,347
I think it was
actually appraised

471

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,132
Ahh.

813
00:41:32,268 --> 00:41:34,433
Sorry to do this to you,

814
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:37,468
but you have
something I need.

815
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:46,475
See, that's the thing
about our work...

816
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:58,573
It always comes back
to haunt you.
