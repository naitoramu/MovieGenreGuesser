1
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,320
Put it down.

2
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,480
MONDAY 6:32 PM

3
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
HOUR 81 OF THE HEIST

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,760
Raquel is looking great.
That's good.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,960
You know,
after a breakup things can be complicated

6
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,640
until both parts get over it.

7
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,120
Yes. I'm glad too.
Raquel really is an extraordinary woman.

8
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
Yes, certainly.

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
If she and our daughter are well,
then we're all good.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,880
Is it hot? I can turn on the AC.

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,400
No. The temperature's fine.
It's me, I'm feeling a bit...

12
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,480
a bit rough.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,120
You had coffee from the caterers?

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,640
That crap shouldn't be allowed.

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,480
I guess I did make that mistake.

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,840
I had three cups and besides,
I have this thing.

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a colon thing. It's nothing serious,
it's this bacteria that...

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,960
well, it makes me have to go
to the bathroom more often than usual.

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,720
It's a bit embarrassing, but I didn't want
to go number two at the crime scene.

20
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
Do you want me to stop?

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,560
If you don't mind. Thanks.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
It's no problem.
I'll pull into the next gas station.

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,040
Actually,
it'd be best if we just pulled over now.

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,600
Look, we could stop here.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
-There?
-Yes.

26
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,440
-Of course. No problem.
-Thank you.

27
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,760
Salva.

28
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
Salva.

29
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Are you alright?

30
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
Yes, much better.

31
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,760
You wouldn't believe some people.

32
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm ready when you are.

33
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,960
Suarez, come here for a second.

34
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Pilar.

35
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,760
I want you to examine Angel's car.

36
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,840
We already did. It's part of procedure.

37
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,120
And did you find anything unusual?

38
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,120
The brake fluid hoses were clogged, but
that doesn't mean anything.

39
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,120
What do you mean?
It could have been tampered with.

40
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,520
It could be,
but it isn't usually the case.

41
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,160
Brake hoses get clogged, parts break...

42
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,560
It's what happens when a car rolls
over twice at 170 km/h.

43
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,840
-I'm sorry.
-Wait, wait.

44
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,760
Did he say where he got the teaspoon
he gave you?

45
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,400
No, he didn't.

46
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,880
I have to get back to work.

47
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,640
Suarez, when did Angel arrive to Toledo?

48
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Yesterday, right?

49
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
Yes. But...

50
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,400
It's possible that he found it here,

51
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,600
that he came to this house before us.

52
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,080
I don't know.

53
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,880
Maybe he took it from the bar
in the village or from the pharmacy.

54
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,520
Maybe he suspected someone
and wanted to make sure...

55
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,440
Raquel!

56
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,440
Take it easy.

57
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,000
That won't help.

58
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,920
Only Angel knows
where he got the spoon.

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,760
Angel and the guy
who's helping them from outside.

60
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,840
The same guy who was
listening in on our calls

61
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,280
and tried to kill Angel
by tampering with his car.

62
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
She just said there's no proof of that.

63
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
Angel had a lead.

64
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,080
And they tried to murder him.

65
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,440
And they'll try again if he ever wakes up.

66
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
What are you trying to say?

67
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,240
This time, we're setting the trap.

68
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
I was thinking about what you said,

69
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,640
about wanting the best for Raquel.

70
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,480
What?

71
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,760
Well, I don't believe it's true.

72
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,520
If it were, you wouldn't be

73
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,720
fucking her sister.

74
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,920
That's none of your business.

75
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm sorry, but I think it is.

76
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
When I heard about you I thought:
"this guy must be

77
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,200
head over heels in love
to get himself into a mess like this".

78
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,000
Falling in love and fucking your wife's...

79
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
sister.

80
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,520
But when I found out that you were hitting
on your daughter's teacher...

81
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,080
Your daughter's teacher.

82
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,520
Then I understood.
You're one of these guys

83
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,400
who shares his intelligence
with his cock and muscles.

84
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,160
Someone disturbed who has to wear
a social disguise.

85
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,600
The worst is that

86
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,120
Raquel has to see a psychiatrist,
when it should be you.

87
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,800
Of course you won't,
you don't realize how messed up you are.

88
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,120
Motherfucker.

89
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
Motherfucker? Me?

90
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,680
Piece of shit.

91
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,920
Get out of the car.

92
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,920
If I get out of the car

93
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll beat you so hard,
you won't know what day it is.

94
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,320
Get out of the fucking car!

95
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,800
Do you know what this is?

96
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
My meds.

97
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,000
Days to live.

98
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,040
It's unbelievable

99
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,520
how something so valuable
is kept in such a fragile container.

100
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,560
Right?

101
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,840
You haven't taken very well
losing the elections.

102
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,720
You should work on that.

103
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,240
I won't sit around waiting

104
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
for them to kill me,
just because we fucking voted on it.

105
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,880
Stay if you want.

106
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,560
But you don't get to decide for us.

107
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,840
That's it, you can go in peace.

108
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,920
No problem. I'll keep you in my prayers.

109
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,720
I have spent some truly wonderful days
with you all.

110
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,720
Tokyo, get to it. They're coming for us.

111
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,200
Tell us about Plan Chernobyl,

112
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
or I'll break your whole stash.

113
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,760
No.

114
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,320
No.

115
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,640
You're going to torture me
by breaking little bottles?

116
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,600
Oh, Tokyo.

117
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,840
So mature for some things,
and so childish for others.

118
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
You should consider
something more convincing.

119
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
Like cutting off one of my limbs.

120
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,960
But I'm so high on opiates
that I might not even notice.

121
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,880
Denver.

122
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,400
Give me the gun.

123
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,360
Tell us what Plan Chernobyl is.

124
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,760
You don’t have what it takes.

125
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,240
You don’t.

126
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,840
Three.

127
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,280
Two.

128
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,080
One.

129
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,240
Is there something you want to say now?

130
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,600
I'll show you.

131
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,760
You're going to get hurt.

132
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,480
There goes number two.

133
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,400
Son of a bitch.

134
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,760
What the fuck are you doing?

135
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,360
We're playing Russian roulette, Nairobi.

136
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,520
Come back later.

137
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,720
Damn it, Tokyo!

138
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,720
Have you gone insane?
What the hell are you doing?

139
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,160
Are you trying to get us all screwed?

140
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,120
You're going to fuck up the plan.

141
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,600
Clearly.

142
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,520
All on your own.

143
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm fucking up the plan?

144
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,800
You can't, can you?
You can't stop and think for once.

145
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
Brainless piece of shit!

146
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,240
I may be brainless, but your plan
to go find your son is absolute shit!

147
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,320
What the hell are you saying?

148
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,040
The last time he saw you, how old was he?
Three?

149
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,560
-He doesn't remember you.
-Shut your fucking mouth.

150
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,000
-He won't remember.
-Shut up.

151
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,280
He won't recognize you.

152
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
He already has a mother,

153
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,160
and a father.
For him, they are the real ones.

154
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,960
-You don't know shit!
-What?

155
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,800
-You don't know shit!
-I know that you had him

156
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,440
and abandoned him to get fucking pills!

157
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,200
You know, I can't hear you very well.

158
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Get a little bit closer to the door,

159
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,400
or, better yet,
just open the door and say it to my face!

160
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,920
Fake bitch!
You missed your chance to be a mother.

161
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,080
Face it.

162
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,240
That's enough!

163
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
Hey, Tokyo.

164
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,680
This is getting a little out of hand.

165
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,040
Don't you think?

166
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,680
Didn't you say "no matter what"?

167
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,320
This is it.

168
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,600
Son!

169
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,240
Listen to me!

170
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,360
Come out immediately!

171
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,560
-You're getting into really deep shit.
-Deep shit?

172
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,240
What does it matter?
Everything has fallen apart!

173
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,160
Look, forget about the Stockholm thing.

174
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,160
We rushed to conclusions.
We are not doctors!

175
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
Please don't...

176
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,160
don't blow it.

177
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,680
Do we come out?

178
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,640
No.

179
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
-Maybe we can still vote...
-No!

180
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,280
We already did.

181
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Come on.

182
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
Come on, finish it.

183
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,400
If this is the end for me, shoot.

184
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,000
Come on, Tokyo!

185
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,560
I'm terminally ill.

186
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,880
You won't be cutting short
my hopes and dreams.

187
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,360
But if you're trying to scare me,
keep in mind

188
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,880
that after blowing my head off,
you'll be the scared one.

189
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm the only one that knows the plan.

190
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,680
You won't know
how to get out of this death trap!

191
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
It's all of you

192
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,520
who are playing Russian roulette!

193
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Go on!

194
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Get on with it.

195
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm sorry, Alberto. I got carried away.

196
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,400
Please forgive me.

197
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,080
Alberto.

198
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,960
You're under arrest
for assaulting a police officer.

199
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,120
Don't move!

200
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,880
Stay there.

201
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,120
Romero, I have a detainee.
Assault on a police officer.

202
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,960
Take his prints and lock him up.

203
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,880
Sit here. I'll be right back.

204
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,320
Rest in peace.

205
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
Helsinki.

206
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,200
Whenever you're ready.

207
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,000
<i>Rest in peace, Oslo.</i>

208
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,920
<i>The quietest one.</i>

209
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,280
<i>And the unluckiest.</i>

210
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,400
<i>I would come next.</i>

211
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,440
<i>I earned it.</i>

212
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,320
<i>While the others were on a break,</i>
<i>Berlin gave me what I deserved.</i>

213
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,600
<i>Clearly and irreversibly.</i>

214
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,120
You look like a birthday present.

215
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,160
You're only missing the bow.

216
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,480
What are you going to do to me?

217
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,920
Ration your energy, Tokyo.

218
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,800
Are you going to kill me?

219
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,560
No.

220
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,360
I won't kill you.

221
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,600
I won't torture you either.

222
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,440
Son of a bitch.

223
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I hate you.

224
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,000
Let me ask you something.

225
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
Why does this have to be
the end of something?

226
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,720
Couldn't it be the beginning

227
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,840
of a beautiful friendship?

228
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,240
<i>That's how it all began.</i>

229
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,280
<i>The beginning of the end of the heist.</i>

230
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,760
<i>Of the days in confinement.</i>

231
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,960
<i>Of my love for Rio.</i>

232
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,400
<i>Of everyone's dreams.</i>

233
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,880
<i>Of my freedom.</i>

234
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
Who is it? I can't see her face.

235
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,160
It's Oliveira, sir.

236
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,560
We've got her, sir.

237
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,040
Why the hell have they turned in
one of their people?

238
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,640
Everybody at 20 yards.
She may be carrying explosives.

239
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,680
She's got explosives!
Security perimeter!

240
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,240
<i>Bomb hazard protocol, I repeat,</i>

241
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
bomb hazard protocol. It could be a trap.

242
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,920
On the floor!

243
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,640
Perimeter! She might be carrying a bomb!

244
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Tell her to take off her jumpsuit.

245
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,680
Take off the boots and the jumpsuit!

246
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,880
Take off the boots and the jumpsuit!

247
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
Do it fast!

248
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,400
Take off the boots and the jumpsuit, now!

249
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,520
The t-shirt. Lift up your t-shirt!

250
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,520
Restrain her.

251
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,840
On the ground.

252
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,440
Get on the ground!

253
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,400
Hands up.

254
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,280
Let's see your hands!

255
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,320
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire

256
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,520
Nobody touches her.
I want her alive!

257
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,480
Tokyo.

258
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,080
Tokyo!

259
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,560
Don't move!

260
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
Don't move!

261
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,920
Fuck!

262
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,160
We're risking three things.

263
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,320
Getting killed, getting wounded,
getting caught.

264
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,120
Today we're going
to talk about that last one.

265
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,280
Tokyo.

266
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,720
What do you do if you get caught?

267
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,240
Kick them in the nuts?

268
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,120
Always keep in mind
the golden rule of the heist:

269
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,800
Buy...

270
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,600
time.

271
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,280
Buying time and, indeed,

272
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,480
exhausting every possible way of doing so.

273
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,160
Oh, my stomach!

274
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
-Let's go!
-I can't breathe.

275
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,600
You messed me up, damn it!

276
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,040
Sir, the detainee says she's in pain.

277
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
She's saying she can't breathe.

278
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,640
<i>Requesting medical assistance.</i>

279
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,200
Okay, get her to a doctor.

280
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
Copy that.

281
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,440
Oh, it hurts. It hurts a lot.

282
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,680
-Just a little further back.
-Damn!

283
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
You lied to us.

284
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,320
You said "no personal relations",
but Berlin calls you by your name.

285
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,240
Sergio.

286
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Because that's your name, right?

287
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,360
Tokyo, tomorrow
we may see things in a different...

288
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
I won't see anything tomorrow.

289
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
I got into this because I trusted you.

290
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,960
Because you were going to be
our guardian angel.

291
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,840
Guardian angels don't lie.

292
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,960
My name is Sergio.

293
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
Sergio Marquina.

294
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,240
My father was a heist man.

295
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,080
He was killed in a shootout

296
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,560
with the police outside a bank.
It was him...

297
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,600
who had the idea for the heist.

298
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,080
Of all the people on board,
you're the one with the shortest fuse.

299
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,680
And there will come a time when you think
that everything's falling apart.

300
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,880
That everything is going wrong.

301
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,120
That you're all alone.

302
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,640
But I promise you that won't happen.

303
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,480
I have it all figured out.

304
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,400
Besides, I'm a lucky man.

305
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,640
You're a lucky guy.

306
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,800
Tokyo, I won't fail you.

307
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,720
Always remember that.

308
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,160
<i>The worst that can happen</i>
<i>when you're leading a heist is,</i>

309
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,440
<i>first: Getting arrested for beating up</i>

310
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,920
<i>the inspector's ex-husband.</i>

311
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,480
Take his prints and lock him up.

312
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,520
<i>Second: The police asking you</i>
<i>for your ID.</i>

313
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,080
-ID.
<i>-But only have a fake one.</i>

314
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,560
<i>Third: That they take your fingerprints.</i>

315
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
<i>And worse,</i>
<i>that they match the ones found on</i>

316
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,520
<i>a patrol car that is part</i>
<i>of the investigation.</i>

317
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,040
Empty your pockets here.

318
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
<i>Fourth: That they take your belongings.</i>

319
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,520
<i>Especially</i>
<i>when you have the keys to the hangar</i>

320
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,520
<i>where you set up</i>
<i>and through which they will escape</i>

321
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,880
<i>And a flask with poison...</i>

322
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,960
Those are meds for my heart condition.

323
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,320
It's called Digoxin.

324
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,640
<i>That you were going to use to kill</i>
<i>the Inspector's mother hours ago.</i>

325
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,600
Come with me.

326
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,600
Sit here until they take your statement.

327
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,280
<i>...from the Royal Mint, a few moments ago</i>
<i>the kidnappers have literally thrown out</i>

328
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,760
<i>a person who was gagged</i>
<i>and tied to a stretcher.</i>

329
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,000
<i>The person has been secured</i>
<i>by the Police Tactical Unit forces</i>

330
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,040
<i>and identified as Silene Oliveira,</i>
<i>one of the kidnappers</i>

331
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,320
<i>who was still in the factory,</i>
<i>and is currently being tended to</i>

332
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,760
<i>by medical services</i>
<i>within the security perimeter.</i>

333
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,720
Tokyo lost her mind.

334
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,480
She couldn't take it.

335
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,840
It's not easy.

336
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,080
But I didn’t have a choice.

337
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,440
Hold hands.

338
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,880
Please.

339
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,280
We're all risking our lives here.

340
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,040
It wouldn't kill you to hold hands.

341
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,000
When you have a wound,

342
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,760
the platelets come together to close it.

343
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,360
If they don't, the body will die.

344
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,840
We are wounded and we must unite.

345
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,640
What are you talking about?

346
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,200
-Rio.
-Who do you think you are?

347
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
A preacher?

348
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,360
The leader of a cult?

349
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,280
Will you fly to space
holding his hand?

350
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,240
Rio.

351
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,240
-You need to calm down.
-No.

352
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,400
I won't calm down!

353
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,360
You sent Tokyo to prison.

354
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,960
And you have the nerve
to ask me to calm down.

355
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,680
She's my girlfriend.

356
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,920
My girlfriend.

357
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,720
And you ruined her life.

358
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,960
It's your first love.

359
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,960
Summer is over, you say goodbye
to Suzanne in the French Riviera.

360
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,920
It seems like the end of the world.

361
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,840
Shut your fucking mouth,
you fucking psychopath.

362
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,760
You have no idea
what you're saying, okay?

363
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,360
Anybody still sane?

364
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
Moscow.

365
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,560
Do you think this is right?

366
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,680
Son.

367
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,520
She lost it.

368
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,240
We all saw it.

369
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,240
Nairobi.

370
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,960
There are rules here.

371
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,960
We voted and she didn't accept it.

372
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,840
And then she lost it.

373
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
Denver.

374
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
You realize this is bullshit, right?

375
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,240
Of course I do, man.

376
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,240
But she played
Russian roulette on Berlin.

377
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,840
-What do you think?
-Nothing happened, damn it.

378
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,880
But it was close, this close!

379
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,680
Wake up, kid. Open your eyes.

380
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,560
Tokyo lost it and we can't have
a bomb like that in here.

381
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,080
I can't believe it.

382
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,640
You're all on Berlin's side.

383
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,560
You're all with a psychopath!

384
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,280
We're not on Berlin's side.

385
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,000
We're all on the Professor's side.

386
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,000
The Professor?

387
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,240
He's under arrest.

388
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,760
We all saw it on TV.

389
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,560
He won't call.

390
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,840
He won't wait
on the other side of the tunnel.

391
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,360
Now you'll say
that there are two hours left

392
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,880
for the check-up call, right?

393
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,280
Great.

394
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Because it's the last one.

395
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,160
What will you do when he doesn't call?

396
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm not going to stick around to see it.

397
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,120
We've seen hostages go.

398
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,760
Tokyo is gone.

399
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,240
I guess it won't matter if I go too,
right?

400
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,840
You know it matters, Rio.

401
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,000
But it's your decision and we respect it.

402
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,040
Okay then.

403
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,920
Is someone coming to shut the gate?

404
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,880
Wait.

405
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,840
When you leave...

406
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,560
take this and wave it over your head,

407
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,600
so that they see
you're coming peacefully.

408
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,960
There are snipers and I wouldn't want
anything to happen to you.

409
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,760
Give me a hug.

410
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,000
I want you to do well.

411
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,520
Never stop believing in love.

412
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,880
It's beautiful.

413
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,800
You must trust, trust, trust!

414
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,960
Empty your mind in order to think clearly.

415
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,440
Trust.

416
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,440
Do it. Let yourself go.

417
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,080
Let yourself go. That's it.

418
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,680
He needs to rest and he'll be fine.

419
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,320
<i>Kill Berlin.</i>

420
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,160
<i>Kill Berlin.</i>

421
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
<i>Kill Berlin.</i>

422
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,680
<i>Kill Berlin.</i>

423
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
<i>Those were the only words in my head.</i>

424
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,480
<i>But there was no way.</i>

425
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,640
<i>Try as I might,</i>

426
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,600
<i>I couldn't think of a way</i>
<i>of ruining Berlin's life</i>

427
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,520
<i>that didn't also harm Rio.</i>

428
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,880
<i>I could tell them</i>
<i>how we planned to escape,</i>

429
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,320
<i>or where the hangar was.</i>

430
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,760
<i>But any revenge would also fall upon Rio.</i>

431
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,520
<i>My little Rio.</i>

432
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,040
Fuck!

433
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,560
Son of a bitch. Fuck.

434
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,480
Look who's here, Mr. Prieto.

435
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,920
Miss Tokyo.

436
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,400
Do you usually interrogate women
in underwear?

437
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,160
Why did they turn you in?

438
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,920
Well, shit happens.

439
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,080
Why did they tie you up?

440
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,880
I didn't see eye to eye

441
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,640
with the person in charge.

442
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,760
I tortured him and he didn’t take it well.

443
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,920
Okay.

444
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,880
I want you to know that your money
is still secured.

445
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,400
Just like I found you once,
I'd find you when you get out of jail

446
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,400
and you'd have it.

447
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,560
I mean that we carry on with the plan.

448
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,480
Because in the worst case

449
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,520
you get your money after a few years,
and in the best case...

450
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,640
I try to get you out of the joint
when things have calmed down.

451
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,360
Carrying on with the plan means

452
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,600
not talking to the police,
or to the judge,

453
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,080
or to other inmates, right?

454
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,960
-That's it.
-I'll bite, chew and swallow my tongue

455
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,440
before I rat on anyone.

456
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Well, it's an effective method.
It's a bit rough, but it's effective.

457
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,080
I was going to suggest
something a bit more...

458
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,360
subtle.

459
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Being interrogated is a game of skill.

460
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,480
Like flying a kite that can crash
at any moment.

461
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,240
With your right hand...

462
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,440
you release...

463
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,000
the thread of the truth.

464
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
How many of you are in there?

465
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,640
Eight.

466
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,560
The same ones that planned the heist

467
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,680
in Toledo.

468
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,120
And how long did it take you to plan
the heist in Toledo?

469
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,920
Five months.

470
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,520
When the kite takes off,

471
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,760
when they believe you're telling
the truth,

472
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,880
when they're certain they can get
something out of you,

473
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,320
you pull on the thread
with your left hand,

474
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,760
stopping the kite.

475
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,600
You stall them.

476
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,200
Are you wearing underpants, Colonel?

477
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,000
I've always thought
that army guys like to let it hang.

478
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,360
-Am I wrong?
-"Let it hang".

479
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,840
Why the hell is this girl
not wearing any clothes?

480
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,720
I apologize for that.

481
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,240
Glad to see you again, Miss Tokyo.

482
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,280
This time we'll be pragmatic.

483
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,920
I ask and you answer.

484
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,680
Who is the Professor?

485
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,960
