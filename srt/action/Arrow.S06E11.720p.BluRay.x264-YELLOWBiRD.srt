1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,827
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,582
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,836
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,254
<i>Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,544
<i>By day,
I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,847
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,095
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,555
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,432
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:26,642
You cost me something dear to me.
My son.

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,398
- We decided to go our own way.
- Good luck.

12
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,572
It's our new lair. Helix used
to operate out of here

13
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,695
but it's not like
they're using it anymore.

14
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:38,324
So we've got 'em fighting with
each other instead of fighting us.

15
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,279
Vincent's working with them, too.

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,081
Oliver saw him with
James and the rest.

17
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,203
You don't understand.

18
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,205
You lying son of a bitch.

19
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,911
You were the Green Arrow for my dad.

20
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,995
That's right, William.

21
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,424
I'm sorry you had to step in.
I'm sorry you had to lie to your son.

22
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,461
I don't want to lie to him,
but I can do it if it's temporary.

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,764
I may have solved the glitch
in my chip.

24
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,382
It worked?

25
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,560
Looks like we are not as undermanned
as we thought.

26
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,854
Yes.

27
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,695
I'm a city councilman.
I deserve some respect.

28
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,344
<i>Weather
for the next couple of days,</i>

29
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,967
<i>looking for mostly cloudy skies...</i>

30
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,764
Hey, didn't your shift end
at 6:00, Doc?

31
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,475
That's what I keep
asking myself, Gilbert.

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,449
Hey, man.

33
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,950
<i>Six.</i>

34
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,282
Joe and I are going to
watch the game tonight

35
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,365
if you want to join us, Frank.

36
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,666
No. I wish I could.
Today is going to be a long one.

37
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,670
All right, everybody. Stay calm.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,722
Whoa, what was that? What's happening?

39
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,387
Back away from the walls.

40
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,685
Move back away from the walls.

41
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,978
No, no. We gotta get out of here.

42
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,054
No, no, don't.

43
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,453
Bull's-eye.

44
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,119
Indeed it was, young man.

45
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,334
- Try again, please.
- Okay.

46
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,293
Yes! Ha!

47
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,339
These things... You win again.

48
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,883
Well, you must be out of practice
since you quit being the Green Arrow.

49
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,260
That must be it. Yeah.

50
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,472
- Ready for your field trip, yeah?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,187
- The Coastal Biology center, right?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,195
There's a prep sheet for the trip
and I tried one of the extra credits.

53
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,396
Hold on.

54
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,366
- Will you take a look at it?
- Yeah, of course.

55
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,819
I meant Felicity.

56
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,407
Sure you did. Yep.

57
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,536
I'm sorry. It's a math problem
about hyperbolic geometry

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,457
in marine organisms like coral.

59
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,498
I do know what coral is,
but that's okay.

60
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,705
This is a high-dimension math problem
most people don't get it

61
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,916
until they're in 12th-grade AP.

62
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,134
And it's perfect.

63
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,170
Well, congratulations.
Take your Flash backpack

64
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,176
and don't miss your bus. All right?

65
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,680
- Okay.
- Get out of here. Go learn something.

66
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,058
- I know what coral is.
- Hmm.

67
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,435
- Good morning.
- Morning.

68
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,565
I think we've reached
maximum-level domesticity.

69
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,647
Oh, God, I certainly hope not.

70
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,616
- What's up?
- Councilman Grovner is dead.

71
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,788
- What?
- So are six people in the hospital

72
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,832
and five more electrocuted
by an elevator.

73
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,876
- In an elevator?
- By an elevator.

74
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,419
What? That...

75
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,042
That doesn't make any sense.

76
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,998
- Yeah, Quentin.
<i>- We got a problem.</i>

77
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,049
<i>- An elevator...</i>
- Electrocuted five people.

78
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,503
- Yeah, how do you know?
- I just know.

79
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,930
Look, grab Thea and I'll meet you
at the SCPD, okay?

80
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,843
Oliver, one of the casualties,
it's Frank Pike.

81
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,263
Oh.

82
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,313
I will see you soon.

83
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,152
Frank Pike is dead.

84
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,655
Can you get yourself...
Can you go to the bunker?

85
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,657
Can you find out what's going on,
please? Thank you.

86
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,747
Hey, that chip's really working.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,126
Yeah, I never felt better.

88
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,003
- That's great.
- Or stronger.

89
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,507
- Everything all right?
- No, not even close.

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,637
The city is under some sort
of electronic attack.

91
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,138
- Cayden James?
- You gotta figure.

92
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,845
I mean, cars, cranes,
life support systems,

93
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,726
even elevators are killing people
all over town.

94
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,103
Yeah, hacking electronics I always
thought was a bit of a bank shot

95
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,980
when you have a thermobaric bomb
and amplifier.

96
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,311
And control the port.

97
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,816
- Right.
- It's Oliver.

98
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,648
- Hey, I'm on with John.
- What do we know?

99
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,155
Accidents are happening all over
the city. The size of this attack...

100
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,988
Gotta think it's Cayden James,
but to what end?

101
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,697
Well, should I get William home
or should I be happy

102
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,872
that he's heading out of the city?

103
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,075
Oh, for sure the second one.

104
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,626
Now let's think about looping
in Dinah, Curtis and Rene.

105
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,129
We may have gone our separate ways,
but we have the same goals.

106
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,958
Do it. We need all the help
we can get.

107
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,881
Mr. Mayor.

108
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,007
Quentin, I am...

109
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:35,219
I'm sorry about Frank. He was
a good cop and he was a better man.

110
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,019
Yeah, yeah, he sure was.

111
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,769
But he wouldn't want us standing
around here grieving, right?

112
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,567
Listen, 911 is on overload. Now we've
got no one here to run the show.

113
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,810
Yes, we do.

114
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,981
Just when I thought I was out.

115
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,816
Can you catch me up
on the status here?

116
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,156
Yeah, well,
the status keeps changing,

117
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,908
but I can tell you what we know
so far.

118
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,746
Not bad for one week's worth of work.

119
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,045
I would rather have a team I can
trust than any kind of technology.

120
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,288
Word.

121
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:13,177
- It's Felicity.
- She isn't bugging us again, is she?

122
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,475
No. I'll do a sweep.

123
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,724
- Hey.
- Hey.

124
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,686
Cayden is attacking the city
with a series of coordinated hacks.

125
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,239
He just crashed a plane.

126
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,487
<i>Yeah, I know.
He can hack anything</i>

127
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,738
<i>that is connected to the Internet,</i>

128
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,194
which is practically everything
these days.

129
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,031
So, I was thinking that our teams,

130
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,910
our two separate teams,
could share information.

131
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,714
Yeah, uh, that's a good idea.
We'll share

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,666
any and all information
that can help.

133
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,052
Okay, thanks, Curtis. I'll send you
what I've got so far.

134
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,098
I hope that's all right, guys.
I know we looked at each other,

135
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,675
but we actually didn't verbalize.

136
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,101
Oh, we agreed, Curtis.

137
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,818
- Frank Pike is dead.
- What?

138
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,150
He was killed by one
of Cayden James' hacks.

139
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,153
Is Felicity doing this?

140
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,451
Wait, that...

141
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,248
That can't be.

142
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,870
You know what?
The last time I saw it doing this,

143
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,577
it was tracking Vigilante's visor.

144
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,754
I know, but he modified
his electronics

145
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,127
to block our signal. But...

146
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,254
This is real.

147
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,794
It's locking on to him.

148
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,925
Because your balls never malfunction?

149
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,966
Really? Not this time.

150
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,010
All right, but, I mean...

151
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,437
Could he have messed up?
Did he forget we could track him?

152
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,264
No way, he's too devious.

153
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,475
I think the son of a bitch
is trying to draw us out.

154
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,559
Trap us.

155
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,696
I say we trap him.

156
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,700
You all in?

157
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,869
One, two, three... Suit up.

158
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,170
Yeah, I don't think we should say
"Suit up" all together.

159
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,464
It'd be really cool
if we did, though.

160
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,757
I don't think
it would be really cool.

161
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,337
I mean,
let's just be different than OTA.

162
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,794
Let's be like NTA
and say it together.

163
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,880
But we are NTA and we're cooler
without having to say "Suit up."

164
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,215
Listen, this is kind of what Oliver...

165
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,050
- I'm just saying...
- I'm just saying we should try...

166
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,352
I'm sorry I'm late. There was
an airplane crash on State Street.

167
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,268
It's awful. Is this the Cayden James
you've been talking about?

168
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,353
Most likely. Look, Quentin
can bring you up to speed.

169
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,689
I've asked him to run things here
with your help.

170
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,944
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

171
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,026
Listen, we're taking
SCPD systems offline.

172
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,362
We're setting up communication trees
so officers can talk in person.

173
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,072
Okay, cool.
It's just like the old days.

174
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,156
I'm not that old.

175
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,491
Look, I think it's a great idea.

176
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,872
We should take everything
in the city's government on analog,

177
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,454
and that way, we're out
of James' reach.

178
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,380
In the meantime, we need to do
everything that we can

179
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,799
to minimize panic.

180
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,593
Why don't we set up libraries, uh,

181
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,592
gyms and civic centers
with SCPD protection?

182
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,390
We can take them completely off-grid.
People can come, feel safe.

183
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,059
Safe zones are a good idea.

184
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,681
Now, I have to get back to City Hall.

185
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,013
With the death
of Councilman Grovner...

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,564
- No, go.
- Go, go, go.

187
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,640
We got it.

188
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,941
- Okay.
- Good luck.

189
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,112
I got nothing in the alleyway.

190
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,693
<i>Same for the parking garage.</i>

191
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,783
Zilch here. Back to base?

192
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,115
What was that?
You're comm's breaking up.

193
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,041
Yeah, I'm getting some interference
on my side, too.

194
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,118
Can you guys hear me?

195
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,711
No, they can't.

196
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,757
You're jamming us.

197
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,129
I'll be brief.

198
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,628
I'm on your side.

199
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,464
Cayden James is my target, too.

200
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,557
I'm undercover with his organization.

201
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,802
You think this "T" on my face
stands for "gullible"?

202
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,057
You know what I mean.

203
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,855
I tried telling Dinah last week,

204
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,227
but she didn't give me the chance.

205
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,735
Right now, James is killing
dozens of people.

206
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,567
By tonight, it'll be hundreds.

207
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,107
I need your help.

208
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,785
Why should I trust you?

209
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,494
Go to the subway tunnels where
the Red Line and the Gold Line cross.

210
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,787
An hour from now.

211
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,082
You might be able to save some lives.

212
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,497
Or I could lead my teammates
into a trap.

213
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,133
I could have trapped you here.

214
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,381
But I didn't.

215
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,691
Harold Grovner was
a dedicated civil servant.

216
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,232
Who always wanted what was best
for this city

217
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,654
and we will not forget that.

218
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,233
But with everything
that is happening,

219
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,112
we don't have the time
to mourn at the moment.

220
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,489
So, please, let's get back to work.

221
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,165
Becky, I need Councilmen Gattis,
McCaskell and Kullens,

222
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,244
in that order please.

223
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,500
Your 10:00 a.m. is here.

224
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,841
I don't have a 10:00 a.m.
on my schedule, and even if I did...

225
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,835
I think you'll find this one's
rather important.

226
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,469
Ben Gayle, pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

227
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,391
Thanks for making the time.

228
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,264
Thank you, Becky.

229
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,933
I'll let you make the usual threats
in a minute.

230
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,149
But before we get to that, you should
know that my colleagues are expecting

231
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,901
to hear from me in six.

232
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,822
And if they don't, well,

233
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,949
you would be remiss in forgetting
the thermobaric explosive

234
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,495
that remains in my possession.

235
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,823
What do you want?

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,536
I've already told you.

237
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,461
Vengeance for my son.

238
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,014
I cared for him, protected him,
loved him,

239
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,508
just as you do this city.

240
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,977
But now,

241
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,398
your city's entire infrastructure
is under my control.

242
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,982
Buildings, institutions, even people,

243
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,646
all under my dominion.

244
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,981
These are innocent people.

245
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,816
And you can save them...

246
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,991
By wiring $10 million
into that offshore account

247
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,958
no later than 11:30 tonight.

248
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,713
And every night.

249
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,927
Until further notice.

250
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,466
That will bankrupt us.

251
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,018
Well, I certainly hope so.

252
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,976
Please don't imagine that I've gone
to these lengths for money.

253
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,977
No, this is for you.

254
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,187
So that you'll suffer.

255
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,644
I didn't kill your son.

256
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,858
Yes, you did. One year ago,

257
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,362
this very day,

258
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,285
right here in Star City.

259
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,493
You missed your intended target,

260
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,451
but your arrow found its way
into my boy.

261
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,504
Are you seeking vengeance?
If you want revenge,

262
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,553
why haven't you just outed me
as the Green Arrow?

263
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,714
If my understanding is correct,

264
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,682
that's already been done.

265
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,937
Star City will not negotiate
with a terrorist.

266
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,190
Oh, spare me the political claptrap,
Mr. Queen.

267
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,485
By tonight,
that will sound hollow even to you.

268
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,330
You okay?

269
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,540
I have tried every trick

270
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,750
to counter-hack what Cayden is doing,

271
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,794
and I am completely boxed out.

272
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,387
So I contacted Alena
to help me figure out why

273
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,807
and the answer is,
is that it's my fault.

274
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,676
Felicity, what are you talking about?

275
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,308
When we stopped Cayden and Laurel
from blowing up the Internet vault?

276
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,479
Uh-huh.

277
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,556
That was all a ruse.

278
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,605
Cayden just wanted us to think
that people were in trouble

279
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,936
so that I would break through
his firewall,

280
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,865
but instead of blocking him, I was
actually helping him plant a virus.

281
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,908
Now he has complete control
of the entire city.

282
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,825
The hackcident is killing
one person every 18 minutes

283
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,577
and I have no idea how to stop it.

284
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,657
I do.

285
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,289
Thanks to Cayden James,
who was kind enough

286
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,870
to pay me a visit at City Hall.

287
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,297
- What did he want?
- He wants $10 million a day.

288
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,295
That's not the actual part. He told
me the details of his son's death.

289
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,254
He was killed one year ago today.

290
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,598
Cayden thinks that he was
collateral damage from a fight

291
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,970
that I had in Star City.

292
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,476
It's not possible.

293
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,304
You were in Hub City
recruiting Dinah.

294
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,388
Yup.

295
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,060
If Cayden James is motivated
by revenge,

296
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,437
maybe we can get him to stand down.

297
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,311
Oh, I like that idea, because I have
no way of stopping him my way,

298
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,738
and I have no location for you
to find him your way.

299
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,781
Felicity, we need
incontrovertible proof.

300
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,825
Yeah, I know. I'm on it.

301
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,074
I can't believe
we didn't catch Vincent.

302
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,202
He had a 20-minute lead on us.

303
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,700
Where have you been?

304
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,706
Long story.
I need to check on something.

305
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,675
- Hey.
- Hey.

306
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,093
If we're still sharing intel, I need
you to check on something for me.

307
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,378
Yeah. Shoot.

308
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,136
The subway system specifically
where the Red and Gold Line meet.

309
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,725
<i>I'm trying to stave off a disaster.</i>

310
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,686
Yeah, the automatic track signals
just went offline. How did you know?

311
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,938
- Lucky guess.
- You want backup?

312
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,063
Felicity, I appreciate the intel, but
we're not working together anymore.

313
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,226
My team can handle it.

314
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,396
Handle what?

315
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,488
Cayden James is going to attack
the subway in less than an hour.

316
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,953
I'd say suit up but we already are,
so let's go.

317
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,997
You guys, take a look at this.

318
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,788
This is the city's
transportation system,

319
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,165
and these are all the accidents
that have happened so far.

320
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,548
A lot around the edges.
The train lines and the freeways.

321
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,170
He's laying siege to the city.

322
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,751
It's probably why he wanted the port.

323
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,835
It's exactly what he's doing.

324
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,011
He wants to block off
all the exit routes.

325
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,301
And stop all the reinforcements
from the outside.

326
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,725
Any roads he hasn't hit yet?

327
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,099
Yeah, there's one exit left under
the city and it's the tunnel.

328
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,395
William.

329
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,413
I saw your new mom on TV.
She's pretty hot.

330
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,207
She read you bedtime stories?

331
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,968
Well, at least she can read,
unlike your mom.

332
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,341
This field trip,
it's going to be fun.

333
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,602
- You sure you're good?
- Yup, never better.

334
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,180
I had Cisco put this together.

335
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,816
- You okay?
- Yeah.

336
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,353
We need to move.

337
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,984
Let's go save your son.

338
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,788
Careful
around these metal lines.

339
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,365
Sometimes they can be electrified.

340
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,371
I know that, T. I'm not six.

341
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,918
I didn't know that.

342
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,171
Hey, these tracks are set to cross.
The trains are going to collide.

343
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,924
That could be the switch, that lever.
Pull it.

344
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,091
It's stuck.

345
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,426
These switch boxes are locked though.

346
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,561
All right, stand back.

347
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,017
Here we go.

348
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,818
Okay. Well, Plan B...

349
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,773
Actually, there's no Plan B because
Cayden James has completely

350
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:38,903
overwritten everything
we can do here.

351
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,201
- Maybe Plan C would be...
- Guys.

352
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,362
We can literally
just start pulling things out

353
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,446
till we get the right circuit.

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,990
Guys!

355
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,331
Pull it all out. Pull it all out!

356
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,501
It's not working. Hurry!

357
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,836
- Hey, what's Plan D?
- There's no Plan D.

358
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,667
- What?
- Yes, there is.

359
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,777
All right. I'm going to go see
what's going on.

360
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,449
You kids stay put.

361
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,672
I'm bored, Clayton.

362
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,793
Read us a story.

363
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,427
We have to get out of here.

364
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,509
Everyone stay calm and follow me.

365
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,305
We have to get out of the back.

366
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,154
We can still make it out.

367
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,035
Okay, come on. Move it, move it.
You two help them out.

368
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,328
Hurry, hurry.

369
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,451
Tony. We need to get out of here.

370
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,625
- Come on, come on.
- I can't. I can't.

371
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,078
We need to go! Go.

372
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,123
I need you to go. Go.

373
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,881
William! William!

374
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,468
There's William's bus.

375
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,137
Go, I'll take care of everyone else.

376
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,407
Open the door. Open the door. Move!
Come on! Come on.

377
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,829
Get to the door. Move, move.

378
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,497
Go, go, go!

379
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,790
Come on, keep your head down.

380
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,339
Where's William, Clayton?

381
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,302
- He's stuck behind the sign.
- Go, go.

382
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,105
Come on.

383
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,370
William.

384
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,447
You okay?

385
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,665
- All right, it's okay, it's okay.
- Dad.

386
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,090
We got everyone out safely.

387
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,594
Unfortunately, that tunnel was
the last way out of the city.

388
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,017
So, this is your secret hideout?

389
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,306
Yeah.

390
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,067
You said you weren't
the Green Arrow anymore.

391
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,482
John did take over for me,
but he got injured.

392
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,486
- Guess he's not injured anymore?
- No, he's not.

393
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,871
We've lost the other members
of our team, William, and...

394
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,627
I can't have him out there
on his own right now

395
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,454
with everything that's going on.

396
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,052
- Listen, buddy. I promise...
- You've promised before.

397
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,350
I need to go meet your Aunt Thea.

398
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,764
Could you please hang here?

399
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,194
Damn, that was so fire.

400
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,746
Hey, man, New Team Arrow
is kicking ass.

401
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,247
You know what? I really have to say

402
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,120
that I think we should change
our name.

403
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,126
What do you guys think
about "The Outsiders"?

404
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,087
Ooh. Um... I think
it was a really awesome book.

405
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,884
You guys, talking to Felicity
actually was a good idea.

406
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,587
I mean, if she hadn't given us that
intel, those people would be dead.

407
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,388
About that. I got that information
from Vincent Sobel.

408
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,392
- I'm sorry, what?
- I didn't trust him at first either.

409
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,980
Okay, but I called Felicity
to confirm if his intel checked out,

410
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,435
and it did, clearly.

411
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,234
And that's why you were late
getting back here earlier,

412
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,485
you were talking to him?

413
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,321
So, you didn't bother telling us?

414
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,822
How very Oliver Queen of you.

415
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,451
I had to get all the information
first before I looped you guys in.

416
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,532
Then once I did
have all the information,

417
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,037
we had to stop a subway collision.

418
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,127
But we did, and now here I am,
telling you guys.

419
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,579
Telling us what?

420
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:46,957
Why would Vince help us?

421
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,758
He says he's a double agent working

422
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,676
to take down Cayden James
from the inside.

423
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,298
I mean, that does track,
and the guy used to be undercover.

424
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,054
Which makes him a professional liar.

425
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,013
He's had so many opportunities
to tell me he's a double agent.

426
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,144
Why hasn't he? He just somehow forgot
to mention it?

427
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,224
He says he tried to.

428
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,987
That is absolute crap.

429
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,239
Maybe. But if he
turns out to be legit,

430
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,238
he could offer a tactical advantage
that we can't turn down.

431
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,946
Well, I can, because I will
never work with him again, ever.

432
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,490
Well, obviously Curtis
and I disagree, so...

433
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,658
So nothing.

434
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,043
We all have to agree. Don't we?

435
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,341
Or are just screwing consensus now?

436
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,436
So, maybe you can get some
of your officers

437
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,558
and have them stand over there?

438
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,729
- Okay.
- Great, thank you.

439
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,853
Thought that will put a little extra
pep in your step.

440
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,684
You are my savior.

441
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,235
Me or the coffee?

442
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,030
- Why can't it just be both?
- Hey,

443
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,402
how are things going here?

444
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,859
Well, it's not good, no.
We got no customers at all.

445
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,660
Okay, there's so much happening
right now

446
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,738
that people are too scared
to even come to the safe zones.

447
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,949
Worse still, I got cops standing
around here doing nothing

448
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,453
when they could be out there
helping people.

449
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,001
I'd like to redeploy them.

450
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,204
No. If we get people here,

451
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,163
then we don't need to worry
about protecting them out there.

452
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,626
We have no idea where Cayden James
is going to attack next.

453
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,428
The best thing that we can do for
the city is to get people

454
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,504
to the safe zones.

455
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,218
Could you please call the press?
I have an idea.

456
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,261
Okay.

457
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,978
- Yes.
- You got something?

458
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,058
Bull's-eye.

459
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,852
Alena remembered that last May,

460
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,232
Cayden received a package
from Corto Maltese

461
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,312
and she thinks that in that package

462
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,569
was the evidence that made Cayden
think that Oliver killed Owen.

463
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,320
And how exactly is that a bull's-eye?

464
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,743
Because we know Oliver
didn't kill Owen.

465
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,995
So whatever was in that package,
that evidence...

466
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,368
That evidence had to have been
faked somehow.

467
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,909
- Bull's-eye. Boom.
- All right.

468
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,288
You okay?

469
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,545
Yeah. Yeah, it's just stupid.

470
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,501
Well, you don't do stupid, so?

471
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,179
I don't know. I was just hoping that

472
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,261
since the implant was working
so well, that maybe...

473
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,341
You'd be putting the hood back on?

474
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,303
- Yeah.
- I'm sure you will.

475
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,018
You know, once this whole Cayden
thing is dealt with.

476
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,098
Hope so.

477
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,853
Hope so for his sake.

478
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,068
Oh, man, he just found out that his
father has been lying to him

479
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,148
for a month.

480
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,826
I've been trying to work up the
courage to talk to him, but like...

481
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,787
Stepmom-in-training over here.

482
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,032
You'll do fine, Felicity.

483
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,040
Hey, Will, your dad's on TV.

484
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,039
<i>Are we under
some kind of attack?</i>

485
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,085
<i>A hacker who goes by
the name Cayden James</i>

486
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,631
<i>has taken over the electronic
infrastructure of Star City.</i>

487
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,727
<i>In his hands anything, anything
that is connected to the Internet</i>

488
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,520
<i>can be used as a weapon.</i>

489
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,400
Now sadly this had already led
to a number of casualties

490
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,313
including our police captain,
Frank Pike,

491
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,323
and Councilman Harold Grovner.

492
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,905
Mr. James has made his demands,
but make no mistake,

493
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,199
he is a terrorist

494
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,662
and Star City does not negotiate
with terrorists.

495
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,246
Period.

496
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,715
Instead, we are going to focus on
the safety

497
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,839
and well-being of our citizens.

498
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,510
In that spirit, the SCPD has set up
safe houses throughout the city.

499
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,389
These locations are entirely
analog and you will be safe there.

500
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,726
I promise you,
you will be safe there.

501
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,186
<i>Mr. James, Star City has survived
far worse than you.</i>

502
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:38,938
<i>We will band together.</i>

503
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,325
<i>We will be united
and we will survive this.</i>

504
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,370
<i>- Thank you very much.</i>
- So predictable.

505
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,500
Almost takes the fun out of it.

506
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,672
Time to proceed to the next phase.

507
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,512
Nice speech, and it worked.
Safe zones are filling up.

508
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,269
They are completely offline
and hackcident free.

509
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,515
And in other news.

510
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,479
Yeah, I might have a thing
on our other thing.

511
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,193
On Cayden James' son?

512
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,491
So Alena thinks that Cayden believes
that you killed his son

513
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,695
because of something that arrived in
a package from Corto Maltese in May.

514
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,447
Through a pretty close sequence
of hacks on the mail systems

515
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,624
of several different countries,
not that you need to know about it

516
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,996
but it was really intense
and really cool

517
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,076
and I did it, it was really hard.

518
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,003
You don't need to know about those.
In that package was a USB drive,

519
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,671
we actually have that USB drive's
serial number,

520
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,841
so Alena is just working on trying
to find the computer in Corto Maltese

521
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,919
that uploaded the information
onto that drive that Cayden received.

522
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,589
The information that made him think
that you killed his son.

523
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,256
You see how
I came full circle on that?

524
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,467
One hundred percent.

525
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,184
Awesome.

526
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,474
You should go talk to him.

527
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:58,772
I will.

528
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,453
- Dinah.
- Hey.

529
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,289
If you don't wanna work with him,
we won't.

530
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,421
We do it by consensus,
like we agreed.

531
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:29,383
Look, I acknowledge that Vince
is a complicated variable. Okay?

532
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:34,596
Well, let's break it down.
You know, pro/con style.

533
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,180
All right.

534
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,520
Pro, he's really good and he gets
deep into his assignments.

535
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,941
Con, on our last assignment
he got in too deep.

536
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,364
He can forget what side he's on.

537
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,989
Pro, he's in with Cayden James
and his crew.

538
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,704
and his last intel worked.

539
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,501
If you didn't know Vincent,

540
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,580
if you could remove
this history with him...

541
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,584
If, as a cop, he came to you
with some intel,

542
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,511
what would your gut tell you?

543
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,014
- Do we have new intel from him?
- No.

544
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,763
Then I'm not going
to answer that yet.

545
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,233
You know, there's, um,
a study I was reading

546
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:29,614
that was saying that actually talking
to a child is one of the most

547
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,615
effective parenting techniques.

548
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,493
- No kidding. Is that true?
- Yeah.

549
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,495
Well, I have learned several times
the hard way that

550
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,963
sometimes kids just
want to be left alone.

551
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,256
I know I have to talk to him.
I'm just trying to respect that.

552
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,337
Okay.

553
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,469
And I might
totally be projecting here...

554
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,560
Because my dad was a, you know,

555
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,179
super-villain, evil hacktivist but...

556
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,349
He did a lot of things

557
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,728
that I didn't like or approve of

558
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,946
and the way he chose
to live his life,

559
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,489
that's not the part that bugged me.

560
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,031
- Okay, what bugged you?
- The lie.

561
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,072
All I ever wanted was for him
to tell me the truth, you know.

562
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,119
And that's all William wants,

563
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,621
all he wants to know is the truth.

564
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,543
The good, the bad, the ugly,
he just wants to know the truth.

565
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,213
William knows the truth.
Well, he knew

566
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,498
the truth.

567
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,551
And he decided that
he didn't want me in situations

568
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,674
where he might lose me.

569
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,721
Okay, but here we are.

570
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,348
And everything that has
happened with John,

571
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,550
and everything that has
happened with the team,

572
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,977
and everything that is happening
right now with Cayden James.

573
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,053
Here we are.

574
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,640
And you know what I think?

575
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,938
I think William can handle it.

576
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,105
- I don't know.
- I do.

577
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,407
Because, you know,

578
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,235
genetics.

579
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,163
Aren't you ready yet?
We're moving out.

580
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,965
I'll be right there.

581
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,432
What's going on?

582
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,234
Vincent's using the link to my
T-Sphere to send a message.

583
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,107
Morse code.

584
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,312
Clever, what does it say?

585
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,023
"Attack.

586
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,363
"Oak Street,

587
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,240
"now."

588
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,036
I'm assuming that's a warning,
not a directive.

589
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,796
Oak Street is one of the safe zones
Oliver and Quentin set up.

590
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,925
What do you want to do?

591
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,721
Suit up.

592
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,890
Officers marching, guns out.
City under siege.

593
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,895
It's like <i>Escape from Detroit.</i>

594
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,480
I don't know whether to correct you
or to just embrace your attempt

595
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,735
at referencing one of my favorite
John Carpenter films.

596
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,316
- Huh?
- I think the point,

597
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,448
is that people are scared.
It's not good.

598
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,411
They should be scared.
It's why they need us.

599
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,663
When you say "us,"
do you mean just you,

600
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,208
and it's a passive dig at
our team, no pun intended?

601
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,085
Or do you mean all of us,

602
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,838
and you recognize our own team
as being independent...

603
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,920
Curtis, we got your message,
thanks for reaching out.

604
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,054
So what are we dealing with here?

605
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,429
We have it on good authority
this place is Cayden James' next target.

606
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,138
- How do you know?
- We know. That's all that matters.

607
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,496
Not to spoil the really awkward
team reunion, but you have incoming.

608
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,703
Oh, you have lots of incoming.

609
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,092
We need to move out. Right now.

610
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,847
Is Dad gonna be okay?

611
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,519
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

612
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,680
Look, I know you're not all that
happy with your dad right now,

613
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,764
but this,

614
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,685
this is what he does best,
and nobody does it better.

615
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,652
<i>But everybody makes mistakes,</i>

616
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,446
things go wrong,
you can't plan for everything.

617
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,363
Yeah, you're right.

618
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,904
What your dad does, it's...

619
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,157
<i>It's very dangerous.</i>

620
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,122
And heroes don't always make it home.

621
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,796
I never forget that.

622
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:04,430
<i>But, you know, I've loved your dad</i>

623
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,478
<i>from the first time he brought me
a bullet-riddled computer.</i>

624
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,646
Remind me to tell you about that one.

625
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,980
<i>That was a long time ago, which means
I've loved him for a long time,</i>

626
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,777
which means I've worried about him
for a long time.

627
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,319
And he hasn't always been truthful.

628
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,072
<i>He's lied, he's kept secrets,</i>

629
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:25,872
he's not perfect.
This life, it's not ideal.

630
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,038
But he makes his sacrifices,
so we have to make ours.

631
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:32,995
I sometimes think to myself,

632
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,456
that that's what makes this love
deeper than other kinds of love.

633
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,758
I know it sounds cheesy but,

634
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,587
it does, because we can't
take things for granted.

635
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,216
<i>We have to live with the fear
and the uncertainty</i>

636
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,594
<i>that everything
can be taken from us in an instant.</i>

637
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,050
Traitor!

638
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,018
I'm taking you to hell with...

639
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,434
<i>'Cause that's the price we pay
for choosing the people that we love.</i>

640
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,770
Everything he does,
he does for a good reason.

641
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,030
Or what he thinks is a good reason.

642
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,995
So you can worry about your dad,
but you have to believe

643
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,869
that he's going to be okay.

644
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,996
Because that's the only way
that this works.

645
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,536
Okay?

646
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,710
Okay, now, watch.

647
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:24,218
Now, after he takes these two down,
he's gonna spin, disarm him, kick.

648
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,424
He's probably gonna use the arrow
right here. Oh!

649
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,302
You probably shouldn't have been
allowed to watch that,

650
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,058
that's definitely in Parenting 101.

651
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,141
Good work.

652
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,647
Doesn't change anything, hoss.

653
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,823
Come on.

654
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,495
At least, he's pretty...

655
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,375
Amazing, yeah.

656
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,172
Well, I was gonna say "badass."

657
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,509
- Badass.
- Yeah.

658
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,675
Well, for two teams
that do not trust each other,

659
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,135
you guys worked together pretty well.

660
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,970
Well, except for the fact
that they never shared with us

661
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,350
where they got their information.

662
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,353
What's happening?

663
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,109
Cayden's shutting down
all communications.

664
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,063
E-mail, TV, cell phones,
Internet traffic, everything.

665
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,689
We didn't meet his 11:30 deadline.

666
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,321
Please talk to Alena and tell her
that we are running out of time.

667
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,494
I already did, she is working
as fast as she can.

668
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,534
What are we gonna do?

669
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,624
I need to go talk to my son.

670
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,344
You saved Rene's life tonight.

671
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,089
Thank you.

672
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,807
I'm on your side, D.

673
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,556
I wasn't so sure before.

674
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,893
So, what now?

675
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,528
When I was growing up,

676
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,613
if something happened, my dad would

677
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,695
call a family meeting so that
we could all talk about it.

678
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,913
And I know we've both already
talked to you separately,

679
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,410
but we just thought
we'd all get together

680
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,618
and just sort of, talk it out.

681
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,418
Put it all in the open.

682
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,257
I'm terribly sorry
that I lied to you.

683
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,968
There is no excuse for it.

684
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,339
I'm new at this whole dad thing,
but that's not an excuse either...

685
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:37,226
I've been tryin' to work my way
through it, and I've hit more

686
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,683
bumps in the road
than I thought that I would.

687
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:42,939
As you know.

688
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,071
But no more secrets,
and no more lies.

689
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:50,242
And, William, if you need me
to stop being the Green Arrow,

690
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,195
I will.

691
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,541
Felicity showed me
what you did tonight.

692
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,246
I gotta say it was really cool.

693
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,835
The city needs you
and I get that now.

694
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:12,965
Are you sure?

695
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,932
Yeah, I mean, I was worried before
that I would become an orphan.

696
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,272
But it's different now.
I have Felicity.

697
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,522
I understand
why you have to go out there.

698
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,985
I'm gonna get to bed.

699
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,360
You sleep well, William, okay?

700
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,615
Thanks.

701
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,915
What you said was touching.

702
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,714
It was kind of awful, too.

703
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,543
That's the actual definition
of "bittersweet."

704
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,752
Okay, well, don't let it get to you.

705
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,212
Yeah, it's not...

706
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,047
- Oliver.
- It's not, it's...

707
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,972
If I've learned one thing about
parenting so far that I'm sure of,

708
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,979
you can't win 'em all.

709
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,121
It's Alena.

710
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,785
She went through all the computers
in Corto Maltese.

711
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,120
She didn't find anything, I'm sorry.

712
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,039
I've gotta get to City Hall.

713
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:28,874
What are you gonna do?

714
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,904
Wire the money.
