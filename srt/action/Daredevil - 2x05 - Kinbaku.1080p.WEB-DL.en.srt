1
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:32,562
Oh, it tastes like fish eggs.

2
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,233
I think they are, Einstein.

3
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,485
And it tops out at $200 an ounce.

4
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:40,779
You two really think
you can crash this party?

5
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:43,531
- Yes.
- We're kind of ambitious.

6
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:45,993
- Are you gonna kick us out, bro?
- Depends.

7
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:48,245
Are you pompous jackasses?

8
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:50,330
Uh, well, we're not... pompous.

9
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:52,082
Help yourself.

10
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,502
Mmm, the taste kind of grows on you.

11
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:58,756
You wanna get down on this?
Pull up a stool.

12
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,758
Uh, you do that.
I'm gonna find the alcohol.

13
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,426
Genius! And grab me a beer!

14
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:08,265
It's not a cabin cruiser,
it's a yacht.

15
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:10,350
For the $24,000
we're paying Dalton,

16
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,895
I would expect Jackson's
modern dance to be included.

17
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,980
I like the way
the Jets are playing this year.

18
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,314
- Excuse me.
- It's time to go.

19
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:59,399
- No, I'm just looking for...
- You found it.

20
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:01,026
Come on.

21
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,244
He's with me.

22
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:13,956
Excuse me.

23
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:34,744
Mmm! German beer.
Tastes like piss.

24
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:38,874
What the hell are you doing here?

25
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,001
You've never been hard to find.

26
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:43,128
That's not what I asked.

27
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,006
At least your furniture's improved.

28
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:49,301
Kinda liked my old futon.

29
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:51,970
I liked breaking it in.

30
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:53,972
Nice place.

31
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:56,433
Too bad about the clothes, though.

32
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:57,725
Why are you here?

33
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,940
Would you believe it if I said
I missed you?

34
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:04,732
- No.
- Smart man.

35
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:07,235
Columbia education really paid off.

36
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,155
No thanks to you.

37
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:13,241
I'm in New York for a meeting.
I thought I'd pop by.

38
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:15,702
Well, you're not staying here, so...

39
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:17,120
Fine.

40
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:20,540
My penthouse in midtown
will just have to do, then.

41
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:21,833
We spent some nights there.

42
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,626
Look, if you came here
to walk down memory lane,

43
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,310
- I don't really have the...
- I'm sorry.

44
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:31,634
I've spent years trying to convince myself
that things happen for a reason,

45
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:34,429
that you and I were not meant to be.

46
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:40,768
But I know now.
That wasn't fate.

47
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:42,938
It was a choice.

48
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,857
My choice.

49
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,069
And I'm sorry.

50
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm alone in the world, Matthew.

51
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:58,495
Do you know what that feels like?

52
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:03,666
Of course you do.

53
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:08,964
And you know what it's like
to clean up your father's messes.

54
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:13,301
A long time ago, before he died,

55
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:16,346
my father did business
with the Roxxon Corporation.

56
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:17,430
Roxxon?

57
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:20,392
Energy, cleaning supplies,
macaroni and cheese.

58
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:22,894
Child labor, slave trade.

59
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:24,521
They have their fingers in everything.

60
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,939
I believe it's called diversification.

61
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,401
And thanks to my father's
shitty investments,

62
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:30,777
they hold most of his wealth.

63
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,903
Yeah, okay, I...

64
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:36,824
I have a meeting tomorrow with the board
at the Yakatomi Building.

65
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,786
And I need your help, Matthew.

66
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,913
How am I supposed to help you?

67
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:44,666
I want you to use that expensive
legal training of yours

68
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,210
- to help me get my money back.
- See, I'm a defense lawyer.

69
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:50,088
- I'll pay you well.
- I'm not taking your money.

70
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,965
And, even if I accepted,
there's not enough time.

71
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,260
- For what?
- Oh, just research.

72
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,554
Accounts, shareholders,
hierarchy of the...

73
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:00,682
- You have 15 hours.
- Fifteen hours, Elektra, are you insane?

74
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:02,016
Matthew.

75
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,814
You're the only person I can trust.

76
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:12,026
Well, sweetheart, you don't break into
my house and then talk to me about trust.

77
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,945
Don't overthink it.

78
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:16,364
It's just a bunch of guys
in business suits.

79
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:18,491
They won't know what hit them.

80
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,910
Would be fun, like old times.

81
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:24,122
Oh, you and I,
we have very different ideas of fun.

82
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,582
You can say whatever you want.

83
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,168
- But I know you...
- No, you don't.

84
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,377
You don't, not anymore.

85
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:33,090
Not... ever again.

86
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,054
Well...

87
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,931
that's disappointing.

88
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,685
Get out.

89
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,621
Morning.

90
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:07,582
We, uh, have anything for breakfast?

91
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,000
You hungry or hungover?

92
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:12,920
Both.

93
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:17,008
All right, you need some potassium,
some electrolytes, and a jolt of caffeine.

94
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:19,177
I'll give you, uh...

95
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:24,391
The last piece of Mrs. DiNizio's
peach cobbler,

96
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:27,227
which is the last piece of anything
in this office.

97
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,062
I guess our finances
haven't improved since last week.

98
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:33,483
Yeah, well, clients don't respond well
to a "closed" sign.

99
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:36,736
Yeah, it's my fault.

100
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,821
- I'm sorry, Foggy.
- Don't be.

101
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,240
Punisher off the street.

102
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:42,492
I'm hoping Reyes
will get her jackboot off our neck

103
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,744
and this office can go back to normal.

104
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:47,372
Oh, yeah? Normal? What's that?

105
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:51,918
Matt. Uh, good morning.

106
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:53,170
Hey, Karen.

107
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:55,547
Did you sleep well?

108
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,175
Uh, not so much. You?

109
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,051
Me? Yeah, sure.

110
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:01,344
I mean...

111
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:03,680
Is that coffee I can smell?

112
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,640
- Hmm?
- Coffee.

113
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,142
Uh, yeah, um...

114
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,269
Yeah, arabica for all.

115
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:12,230
- For everyone.
- Wow, thank you. You're a goddess.

116
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,857
Okay, you two.
Let's talk business.

117
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,984
Potential clients. Real ones.
With bank in the bank.

118
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:20,197
Uh, actually, yeah, can we, uh...
talk about these first?

119
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,866
The, uh, press is still painting Castle

120
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,911
like he's nothing more than
some deranged lunatic.

121
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:29,874
Well, it's not like our boy was
out collecting for the Red Cross.

122
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:33,084
- I know. I know, but...
- You think there's more to the story.

123
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,420
Exactly. I mean, five different papers

124
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:37,339
and not a word about the bullet
he took to the brain,

125
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:39,090
or his military record, or his family.

126
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,133
Uh, his family?

127
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:44,387
Um...

128
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:45,555
Okay, uh...

129
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:48,099
I found this photograph.

130
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:50,560
It's of him and his wife and kids
at the carousel.

131
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,978
You found it where?

132
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,814
I sort of broke into his house.

133
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:55,897
- You did what?
- What?

134
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,984
- It was ill-advised, I know.
- Not to mention dangerous.

135
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,667
- And illegal.
- Yeah...

136
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:00,862
It's all that. All of that.

137
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,948
And I don't need a lecture or I will
take those coffees back, okay?

138
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,494
Thank you.

139
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:11,248
Look, it's not just about the press.

140
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:14,584
The DA's office released their statement
and it's full of holes, too.

141
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,045
Something big is going on here, guys,
and it all circles back to Frank Castle.

142
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,464
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Foggy...

143
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:22,217
No, come on, we successfully dodged
a metaphorical bullet

144
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,593
and quite a few literal ones.

145
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:26,429
We need to be done with the crazy, guys.

146
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:28,055
We need normal.

147
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:34,521
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:38,024
I'm really sorry if I...

149
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:40,067
- I pushed it too far.
- It's okay.

150
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,736
I just...

151
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,614
Uh, I don't think you're wrong
about Castle, but...

152
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,284
it's really simple, Karen.

153
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,118
Just... I don't want you to get hurt.

154
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,791
So, uh...

155
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:56,584
Last night.

156
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,044
Last night?

157
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:01,256
I don't... What happened last night?

158
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,674
- At Josie's? With Foggy?
- You...

159
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:03,957
- Did something happen?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:05,635
- Anything else? I don't...
- Yeah?

161
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,181
Yeah, it was great.

162
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:15,978
And I like to think I can do better,
if we're still on for dinner.

163
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:17,439
Uh, yeah.

164
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:19,148
It's a date.

165
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,567
Holy shit!

166
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:24,153
- That was the bank.
- Oh, no.

167
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:27,156
No, it's... all good.
There was a deposit.

168
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,825
A big one.

169
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:30,785
What? Uh...

170
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:33,204
Um, yeah...

171
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:35,790
Yeah, uh, do me a favor,
don't spend any of it.

172
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,208
- Why not?
- God...

173
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:40,211
I was hit up by a potential client
yesterday, so, I just...

174
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,046
Is it dirty money?
Are we doing that again?

175
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,923
No! No, it's nothing like that.
It's just, um...

176
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:46,126
I'm not sure
it's gonna work out, let me...

177
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:48,260
Let me get into it, I'll...
I'll get back to you.

178
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:55,518
Hey, I'm gonna have a Macallan, neat,
and the lady will have, uh...

179
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,812
another vodka martini.

180
00:10:57,895 --> 00:11:00,189
- Perceptive.
- Thank you, I try.

181
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:01,941
But I can order my own drinks.

182
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,944
Tequila. Mezcal, if you have it.

183
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,532
So, thanks for your help.

184
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:12,326
It's hard to find reliable
security these days.

185
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,956
Nice shoes.

186
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,416
What?

187
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,628
Wingtips. Good call.
Shine them yourself?

188
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:24,130
How'd you know?

189
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,716
You're not exactly a tough read.

190
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:28,718
I...

191
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,136
could surprise you.

192
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,389
Doubt it.

193
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,557
All right.

194
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,852
You, uh, wanna give it a try?

195
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,230
Okay.

196
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:43,775
You desperately want
to belong somewhere...

197
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:46,277
with someone,

198
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,531
which is the real reason why
you sneak into fancy faculty parties.

199
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,866
Not because you're sick of your ramen

200
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,826
and video games routine.

201
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:58,372
And now, your mind is racing.

202
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:04,504
You're wondering what you can possibly
say or do to keep me on the line,

203
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:08,299
because the last thing you want
is to spend the rest of the evening

204
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:11,302
with that scotch
and that shaggy-haired friend of yours.

205
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,515
You know what your problem is?

206
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:16,641
You're pretty.

207
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:19,351
You even work the blind thing.

208
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:20,562
But you're dumb.

209
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:23,147
You lost before you even
stepped to the plate.

210
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,571
You get all of that
from a pair of old wingtips?

211
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:32,031
Quick study.

212
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:39,956
- You wanna know what I think?
- Tell me.

213
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,834
I think the game's just beginning.

214
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,631
Because despite your artisan tequilas

215
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:50,925
and charm-school manners...

216
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:56,723
Despite being richer than God and having
the whole world at your fingertips...

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,226
you're just bored.

218
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:03,980
Really?

219
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,274
Bored enough to spend your time
studying a stranger's shoes.

220
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:14,323
See, I think you were dying on the vine
of this tight-ass party,

221
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:17,660
because Daddy's money can't buy you
the one thing you really need.

222
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:21,789
And what's that?

223
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,666
The unexpected.

224
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,131
Maybe you're not so dumb.

225
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:33,009
Elektra Natchios.

226
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,136
Matt Murdock.

227
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:42,226
Let's go, Matthew.

228
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,529
On your left.

229
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,501
Do you like it?

230
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:10,004
Sounds expensive.

231
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,505
You have good ears.

232
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,929
- Is it yours?
- It is.

233
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,263
Until we get caught.

234
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,150
Mr. Tower?

235
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,195
Uh, I wish you'd called.
I'd have set something up.

236
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,323
- Are they in?
- Uh, just the Nelson half.

237
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:38,616
What's the problem?

238
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,117
We need to talk.

239
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,078
In private.

240
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,878
You know, it's really not
a good idea to piss her off.

241
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,882
So, what can I do
for the Assistant District Attorney?

242
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:57,635
It's more what I can do for you,
Mr. Nelson.

243
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,721
We need all your files on the Grote case.

244
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:02,765
Notes, interviews, any and all
recordings and e-mails.

245
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,266
And in return, we get...

246
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,852
I convince District Attorney Reyes

247
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:08,605
to scratch the names Nelson
and Murdock off her shit-list.

248
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,356
Wow.

249
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,024
There's an actual list?

250
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,308
- Mr. Nelson, I...
- I'm sorry.

251
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:17,113
Believe me, the sooner this Punisher
mess is off our plate, the better.

252
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,866
So... show me a subpoena, and...

253
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,369
Is there a problem?

254
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:29,541
Are you really going to make me
jump through hoops for this?

255
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:34,088
Trust me, there's nothing I'd rather do
more than cooperate with your office.

256
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:37,634
But a legal firm sharing privileged
communications with a client,

257
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,011
I mean, even a deceased one,
without a court order?

258
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:42,597
I've seen lawyers get disbarred for less.

259
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,226
And I don't know about you, but I worked
really hard for my law degree.

260
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,936
Nights and everything.

261
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,020
Reyes...

262
00:15:56,119 --> 00:16:00,362
she staked all her political chips
on the conviction of this Punisher freak.

263
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:02,748
Now, if things'll go her way,

264
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,248
there'll be an opening
in the District Attorney's office

265
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,875
in the not-so-distant future.

266
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:10,165
And DA Tower has a nice ring to it.

267
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:13,541
Now, I'd start considering
the benefits that could accrue

268
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,676
if your firm were more...

269
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:16,964
cooperative.

270
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:20,551
Like I said...

271
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:24,221
show me a subpoena,
and I'll cooperate like a son of a bitch.

272
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:31,145
Reyes is gonna roll over you like a tank.

273
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:32,479
You keep saying that.

274
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,981
And yet...

275
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,608
still kinda here.

276
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,610
I'm gonna have to pay for that.

277
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:21,070
I'll stake you.

278
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:24,741
So this is the famous Fogwell's.

279
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,868
Yeah, breathe it in fast.

280
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:32,081
If we get arrested for breaking
and entering, the fun kinda stops.

281
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,457
Shows what you know.

282
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,793
I haven't been here in a while.

283
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,046
I bet nothing's moved.

284
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:46,721
- Thanks.
- So tell me.

285
00:17:47,638 --> 00:17:50,516
- How does a blind man box?
- Oh, uh...

286
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,852
I don't...
I can't.

287
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:54,854
My dad, he was the boxer.

288
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:56,563
Was?

289
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,607
Yeah, he died.

290
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,817
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,155
I just come here to...
breathe in the smell of sweat.

292
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:08,284
Hear the clank of the chains
holding the bags.

293
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,701
Remember him.

294
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:13,831
You never saw your father fight.

295
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:17,459
Oh, I saw him get his ass beat
more times than I can count.

296
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,630
I wasn't born blind.
That's a...

297
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,132
whole other story.

298
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:30,389
Did he die in the ring?

299
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:32,934
Uh...

300
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:35,311
No, boxing didn't kill him.

301
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:36,478
What did?

302
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,231
Organized crime.

303
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:42,151
Like a mob hit?

304
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,988
- Was he a criminal?
- No.

305
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,804
But I guess you could say he rubbed
some people the wrong way.

306
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,578
Someone in particular?

307
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:57,834
Uh, yeah.

308
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:02,004
A guy named Roscoe Sweeney.

309
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:04,488
I don't know if he pulled the trigger,
but he gave the order.

310
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,593
Did you ever try to find
that piece of shit?

311
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:10,346
Yeah, once. When I was a kid.

312
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,682
Got nothing.
Learned to live with it.

313
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:16,185
He probably went underground.

314
00:19:16,268 --> 00:19:17,979
Well, six feet, I hope.

315
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,316
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

316
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:23,651
I don't.

317
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,528
Are you sure?

318
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,738
Yes.

319
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:29,820
I've seen it.

320
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:33,952
Here and there,
over the past few weeks.

321
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,084
You're so much more than you let on.

322
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,128
Okay.

323
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,219
I feel like I've told you more
in the last ten minutes

324
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:45,797
than I've told anyone else in ten years.

325
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,674
Ha!

326
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:49,426
I knew it.

327
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,763
You knew what?

328
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:56,851
You said you were blind.

329
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,853
No, you said I was blind.

330
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,897
So you can see?

331
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,314
It's complicated.

332
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,364
What about you?
You said you took ballet lessons.

333
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:11,490
I did.

334
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:12,824
In the winters,

335
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:15,827
when my capoeira master
returned to Angola.

336
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:25,880
Muay Thai?

337
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:28,215
- Every other Thursday.
- Of course.

338
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,138
You got me.

339
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:36,640
Get me back.

340
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:38,559
Get me!

341
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,234
I win.

342
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,280
Yeah, first round, maybe.

343
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:53,908
We're just getting started.

344
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,937
Ms. Natchios, good afternoon.

345
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,232
Good afternoon.
You can sit.

346
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:37,113
We hope you know how valuable
your business is

347
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:38,905
to the Roxxon Corporation.

348
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:39,990
Thank you.

349
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:44,453
This is Stan Gibson.
He's the money man for our Japanese arm.

350
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:46,913
So, he'll have the answers
you're looking for.

351
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:49,666
Whether or not he can put them
in terms you'll understand

352
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,960
is another matter.

353
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,340
Let's all prepare to be dazzled, shall we?

354
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,391
- Excuse me, uh, Mr. Ellison?
- Yeah?

355
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:07,309
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.
My name is Karen Page.

356
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:08,977
- I was a friend of...
- Ben.

357
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,479
Yeah, I remember.

358
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:13,982
Look, I think that
I owe you an apology.

359
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:16,105
- At the funeral, I thought that you...
- Forget it.

360
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,112
Look, Ben...

361
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:21,698
Ben was a real pain in my ass.

362
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,410
So it follows that his friends
would be, too.

363
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,120
What can I do for you?

364
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,331
Well, I don't think
you're gonna like my answer.

365
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,167
I'd like to talk to you
about the Frank Castle article.

366
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,919
- I know, terrifying.
- Also inaccurate.

367
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:37,005
Look...

368
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:39,883
that article was corroborated
by multiple sources.

369
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:43,345
NYPD, DA's office,
we even had some eyewitnesses.

370
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,431
Yes, everything that
you reported is correct.

371
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:47,098
It's what you haven't reported
that bothers me.

372
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:49,226
The article is inaccurate by omission.

373
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:53,146
Okay, come here, come here.

374
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,898
Excuse me, please.

375
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:56,066
Go.

376
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:01,780
Right, did you know that two years ago,
Lieutenant Frank Castle

377
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:04,074
was awarded the Navy Cross
for his service in Afghanistan, right?

378
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:05,992
That's second only
to the Medal of Honor.

379
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:07,411
This guy is a war hero.

380
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:09,371
Military history
is the first thing we search

381
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,415
whenever there's a mass shooting.

382
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:15,336
So, we know that he was a Marine recruit,
and we know that he went in as a kid,

383
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,671
but there's no evidence
that he actually served.

384
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:19,590
I've seen the medal,

385
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:21,091
engraved with Castle's name,

386
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:23,427
next to a photograph of him
shaking the secretary's hand.

387
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:27,097
Are you suggesting
that his work was classified?

388
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,391
I don't know, but...
but I would assume.

389
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:31,435
Don't assume. Where'd you see it?

390
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:34,605
Uh, not important.

391
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,022
Pretty important.

392
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:38,149
Look, your article also states
that he had no known relatives,

393
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:39,901
but every paper in New York says that.

394
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:43,029
Well, that was in the press briefing
issued by the DA's office.

395
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:44,365
He had a family.

396
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:48,952
He had a wife, Maria Elizabeth,
a daughter, Lisa Barbara,

397
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:50,871
and a son, Frank Junior.

398
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:53,832
- Had?
- All dead.

399
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,835
Killed around the same time
that Castle was hospitalized

400
00:25:56,918 --> 00:25:58,420
for a gunshot wound to the head.

401
00:25:58,504 --> 00:25:59,505
What, so...

402
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:02,466
What, you're saying that he murdered
his family and then shot himself?

403
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:05,093
Some sort of PTSD murder-suicide attempt?

404
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,177
No, see, if that's what had happened,

405
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:07,513
the DA would have put it in her brief,

406
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:09,055
in flashing neon if she could,

407
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:12,017
because that supports her story
that he's a psychopath.

408
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:16,062
So, what do you think really happened?

409
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:19,400
That's what I don't know yet.

410
00:26:19,483 --> 00:26:22,611
But if I could dig through your files
or I could check into your back issues,

411
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:24,154
maybe I could figure it out.

412
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:28,367
And anything that I find,
anything that I can prove...

413
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,286
The <i>Bulletin</i> gets the exclusive.

414
00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:32,538
Deal.

415
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:34,873
Okay, deal.

416
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:38,419
Uh-uh... don't do any somersaults yet.

417
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:47,303
All the, uh...

418
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,846
All the servers were completely
wiped in the incident.

419
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,848
Decades, just...

420
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,016
gone.

421
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,061
So, um, we keep hard copies
of everything now.

422
00:26:56,144 --> 00:26:57,771
Jeez! Are they in any kind of order?

423
00:26:57,854 --> 00:26:59,440
Um, you know, roughly.

424
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:01,692
I would... I would start, uh, down here.

425
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:03,652
- Okay. Uh, thanks.
- Uh-huh.

426
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,157
- What?
- Oh...

427
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,868
Uh, nothing, I'm just thinking, uh,
somewhere...

428
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:15,622
Ben Urich is looking down,
and just...

429
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,999
getting a real kick out of all this.

430
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,669
Have fun.

431
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:34,975
I'm sure you all have
places to be, things to do.

432
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:37,769
With your wives,
your mistresses...

433
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,230
But I have questions.

434
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:44,610
And this subsidiary,
what is it exactly?

435
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:47,693
- A medical company.
- And they do?

436
00:27:47,773 --> 00:27:50,325
- Studies.
- How specific.

437
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:52,903
Research for pain relievers,
treatments for diseases.

438
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:55,781
The names of which
I mostly can't pronounce.

439
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,086
How do you determine
your acquisitions?

440
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,087
Well...

441
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,255
Excuse me.

442
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,886
There's an issue with our server.

443
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,552
Someone has
hacked into the server.

444
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:13,389
Possibly internal, we don't know yet,
security is looking into it.

445
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:19,520
If it's an external threat,
I'm sure they can trace the IP address

446
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:24,400
and deal with the "problem" face-to-face.

447
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:28,319
But I'm more concerned
about what information

448
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:34,451
they can pull from Roxxon's system
when it is offline.

449
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:36,787
I'm terribly sorry,
something has come up.

450
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,456
Could we reconvene at another time?

451
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,999
Absolutely.

452
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,377
Thank you.

453
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,505
I'll have someone
escort you downstairs.

454
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:48,089
Thank you.

455
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:50,967
In this city, a girl needs
all the help she can get.

456
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:59,643
Why is it gray?

457
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:02,020
One of life's mysteries.

458
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:15,534
They were out of olives.

459
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:18,078
So?

460
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,831
So...

461
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:22,624
What?

462
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,043
It was a hard day.

463
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:27,671
I thought we could catch up,
you know, have a drink.

464
00:29:27,754 --> 00:29:29,172
Just...

465
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:30,381
be like we were.

466
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:32,133
Normal.

467
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:35,429
I haven't heard from you in months.

468
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:37,889
Well, that's...

469
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:39,766
not all that abnormal, right?

470
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:43,937
Yeah, I guess you're right.

471
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,483
Let's get trashed and tell each other
our sob stories. You first.

472
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:49,735
Matt's dating our office assistant.

473
00:29:50,652 --> 00:29:52,571
The cute one?
Blonde, totally your type?

474
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:53,989
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

475
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:55,824
The correct answer is,

476
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:58,952
"No one is as perfect for me
as you, Marci."

477
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:00,120
Gets worse.

478
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:02,038
We lost two clients in the last hour.

479
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:04,249
Oh, it's kinda like when I lost the job
at Landman and Zack.

480
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:07,127
- Thank God HC and B was hiring.
- No, I'm serious.

481
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,378
It's the DA.

482
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,965
I called her bluff on a case
she's building against the Punisher

483
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:13,133
and she doubled down.

484
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:15,093
She's coming after us.

485
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:16,762
I see.

486
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,015
You didn't call me for a social drink.

487
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:21,850
You called me for help.

488
00:30:22,768 --> 00:30:25,771
That feels more normal.

489
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:34,821
Fine.

490
00:30:37,783 --> 00:30:40,035
Rumors among my new partners?

491
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:42,120
Reyes has her sights
on the mayor's office.

492
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:46,457
This is my shocked face.

493
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,669
And she aims to do so by...

494
00:30:48,752 --> 00:30:51,630
building a platform
on Frank Castle's conviction.

495
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,256
She gets him...

496
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:56,635
she sets precedent against
these other vigilantes popping up.

497
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:59,345
One in our office is already
under serious scrutiny,

498
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:01,640
lady by the name of Jessica Jones.

499
00:31:01,723 --> 00:31:03,600
Oh, and you know who I bet is next?

500
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,226
The horny one.

501
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,937
It's... Daredevil.

502
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:10,566
You think it'll work?

503
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:16,863
She's gonna turn city-wide disaster
into damn fine lemonade.

504
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:19,199
It's her big power play.

505
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:20,867
It's gonna work.

506
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:41,054
- Hey.
- Hey.

507
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:45,516
It's been... whoa, three hours.

508
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:47,143
Oh, God.

509
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:49,605
And I'm almost late for dinner.

510
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,898
- Thanks.
- Any luck?

511
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:55,736
Well, these are all the papers
from the week that Castle was shot.

512
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,571
I've been through each one
of them three times,

513
00:31:57,654 --> 00:32:00,073
and there's not a single mention
of Castle, his family...

514
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:02,242
Not even a John Doe that matches.

515
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:03,534
Just nothing.

516
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,871
Well, you know,
people are shot every day.

517
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:07,497
It doesn't always make the paper.

518
00:32:07,581 --> 00:32:09,457
Cleavered Cleavers.

519
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,584
What's that?

520
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:13,629
Ah, just an old newspaper adage, right?

521
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:15,952
If horror befalls a family
you can paint as all-American,

522
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:17,591
it makes the front page.

523
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:20,385
So, if the Castles are not in this paper,

524
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:22,553
it's because somebody
wants to keep it quiet.

525
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:24,014
Well, shit.

526
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:28,393
April 14th.

527
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:31,688
When was the Castle family murdered?

528
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:34,252
Well, I figure it's gotta be
sometime that week, right?

529
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:38,069
You know, I cannot remember my...
my kids' birthdays, but...

530
00:32:38,153 --> 00:32:42,282
violent, soul-sucking events
are just seared into my brain.

531
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:43,659
Figures, right?

532
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,411
Ah, yes, yes.

533
00:32:46,494 --> 00:32:49,205
Okay, gang-on-gang violence.

534
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:51,541
No civilians were reported injured,
so nobody cared.

535
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,669
It took me a week
to get this in the paper.

536
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:54,920
Here.

537
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,423
Three gangs, Central Park, mid-day.

538
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:00,967
They shot each other to shit.
It was a total massacre.

539
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:03,594
Mexican Cartel, Dogs of Hell...

540
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,263
- Kitchen Irish.
- ...Kitchen Irish.

541
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:07,390
- Those were all the three...
- That the Punisher gunned down.

542
00:33:07,473 --> 00:33:09,713
- There's gotta be a connection, right?
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

543
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,896
- Oh, my God.
- What?

544
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:14,064
Oh, my God.

545
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:22,906
This is it.

546
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:25,241
This is where his family was killed.

547
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,368
Shit, what do I do now?

548
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:28,662
Confirm it.

549
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:32,415
- Can I borrow this?
- Yeah, sure.

550
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:33,917
Just a little reminder...

551
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,252
<i>Bulletin</i> gets the exclusive, right?

552
00:33:36,336 --> 00:33:38,629
- You got it, boss.
- Wait, you're going now?

553
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:39,840
Really?

554
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:48,348
Do you drink wine?

555
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:49,975
I should know that.

556
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:54,020
I don't drink anything
they don't serve at Josie's.

557
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:56,606
Yeah, well,
I don't see swill on the menu.

558
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:02,738
- So how was...
- So what did...

559
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,221
- I'm sorry...
- I was just gonna...

560
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,908
Uh, you go ahead.
Go, go first.

561
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:09,870
How was your day?

562
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:10,954
Fine.

563
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:13,123
Uh, yeah,
just a regular day at the office.

564
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:15,208
Well, it's a nice change of pace, right?

565
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,334
Not being shot at?

566
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:19,545
- That's gotta feel good.
- Yeah.

567
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:23,549
You, how's the, uh, new client?

568
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:26,136
Uh, yeah, um...

569
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:29,222
Nothing I haven't seen before.

570
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:32,058
I seriously doubt it's gonna pan out,
but that's...

571
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:33,769
That's fine.

572
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:35,436
Okay, good.

573
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:41,192
Well, that covers work.

574
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:44,195
Uh, well, it's a start.

575
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:50,410
- Um, I'll be back in just a minute, um...
- Yeah.

576
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:53,038
- Order something fantastic.
- Sure.

577
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,172
- Sir?
- Look.

578
00:35:02,255 --> 00:35:04,800
If I had to seem like I knew everything
there is to know about wines

579
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:07,302
in the next 60 seconds, what would I...
what would I order?

580
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:09,054
- Matthew Murdock?
- Yeah.

581
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:10,430
You have a call.

582
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:12,557
Oh, thanks.

583
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,351
This is Murdock.

584
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,438
<i>Sorry to bother you
while you're out,</i>

585
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:21,357
<i>but you have a few moments
before she returns, right?</i>

586
00:35:23,526 --> 00:35:24,820
What do you want from me?

587
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:27,948
<i>You should ask yourself
the same question.</i>

588
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:30,200
<i>That rooftop act was cute.</i>

589
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:32,843
Yeah, nothing compared
to your damsel-in-distress one.

590
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:37,207
<i>Oh, you're right.
I didn't actually need you.</i>

591
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,334
<i>I told you,
maybe I just missed you.</i>

592
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,294
<i>But don't worry,
you can keep the money.</i>

593
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:44,630
Aw...

594
00:35:44,714 --> 00:35:45,715
Go to hell.

595
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:49,552
<i>If you really want to be done,
consider this me firing you.</i>

596
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:15,871
Any time you want to drive...

597
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:19,374
I think it's illegal, driving under
the influence of blindness.

598
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:20,834
You're the future lawyer.

599
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:23,086
Yeah, I should start
going to class again, then.

600
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,922
- Hey, where are we?
- A house.

601
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:29,342
Yeah. Is it yours?

602
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:32,095
Oh, God, no.
I'd die in the suburbs.

603
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:34,347
No, this charming little chateau

604
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,268
belongs to one of my father's
many work associates,

605
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:42,605
who's currently off to Monte Carlo,
where prostitution is legal.

606
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:44,858
So...

607
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:46,817
you have the keys, right?

608
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:53,616
Welcome home, darling.
Dinner's almost ready.

609
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:57,703
- Tiny kitchen.
- Mmm-hmm.

610
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,042
Okay, so we have, uh...

611
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,795
truffles, <i>saucissons, cornichons...</i>

612
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,130
- Baby pickles.
- No.

613
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:08,548
- Ugh!
- Okay, got it.

614
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:10,300
No <i>cornichons.</i>

615
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:11,509
So...

616
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:15,680
- when you graduate...
- Mmm-hmm.

617
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:18,349
- ...and we get married...
- Wow.

618
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:21,811
...and we buy a house...
I mean, houses, sorry.

619
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:24,314
Santorini, San Sebastian...

620
00:37:24,397 --> 00:37:26,149
Paris, for when we're
feeling cosmopolitan.

621
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:29,110
This...

622
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:30,695
is how we'll live.

623
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:37,660
And what about the kids?

624
00:37:37,743 --> 00:37:39,620
What are we gonna do with them?

625
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,540
Oh, you know, sweet little Ellie, and...

626
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:45,085
her simpleton brother, Matty Junior...

627
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:46,920
...can cook and clean

628
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:49,630
and stock the fridge for us,
so we can use...

629
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:52,092
our time doing better things.

630
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:54,885
Like sex?

631
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,222
Exactly like sex.

632
00:37:57,305 --> 00:37:59,307
Who's thirsty?

633
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:05,271
- Hey.
- Mmm?

634
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,941
- Is it good?
- What?

635
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,192
This.

636
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:11,945
All of this, this, uh...

637
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:13,779
life.

638
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:15,656
It's fantastic.

639
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:22,998
But I would trade it all in
for a lifetime of smelling your skin.

640
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:36,636
Cheers.

641
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:48,189
- Sounded expensive.
- I'm guessing.

642
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,441
I don't care.

643
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:57,240
Get me?

644
00:38:57,323 --> 00:38:59,117
I do, I get you.

645
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,451
When are you going to learn?

646
00:39:01,744 --> 00:39:02,912
Get me.

647
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,834
I have learned.

648
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,546
You know me.

649
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,425
Like no one else ever has.
And I know you.

650
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:18,386
We belong together.

651
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:27,562
Someone's here.

652
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:29,605
Daddy's friend
probably ran out of Viagra...

653
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:30,815
Shh...

654
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:32,567
They're footsteps. Moving fast.
Let me go check.

655
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,778
No, no, no, no, no.
You stay here.

656
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:37,655
If I explain everything,
he won't be mad.

657
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:38,739
I promise.

658
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,511
Matthew, you remember
Roscoe Sweeney,

659
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:02,513
the son of a bitch who killed your father?

660
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:07,893
Hey.

661
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:09,437
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

662
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,482
- Yeah, they ran out of wine.
- No.

663
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:13,733
Wait, seriously?

664
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:16,736
Matt...

665
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:21,782
I don't...
I don't like this place, you know?

666
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:26,954
Is it the place? Or is it...

667
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:28,373
It's definitely not you.

668
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,626
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

669
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,043
I'm positive.

670
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:39,509
Come on.
I know where we can go.

671
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:43,179
- Thank you.
- Wow, this smells amazing.

672
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:46,474
- What is it?
- Um...

673
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:48,434
Who cares?
They have wine.

674
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:49,935
Right.

675
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,229
That's...

676
00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:54,315
You know, I've always felt
more comfortable with the cheap stuff.

677
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:55,983
- You know?
- Yeah?

678
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:57,860
Well, here, I'll drink to that.

679
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:03,491
Cheap stuff.

680
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,618
Cheap stuff.

681
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:10,123
You know, I never even had
Indian food until a few months ago.

682
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,458
How is that possible?

683
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:15,253
Well, my hometown in Vermont
had about 400 people,

684
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:18,088
so the most ethnic food it offered
was French fries.

685
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:23,178
So that's why you, uh, came to New York?
For the... for the food?

686
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,763
Uh, no.

687
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:27,640
Although, if I knew
places like this existed,

688
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:29,350
I'd have left Vermont ages ago.

689
00:41:31,144 --> 00:41:33,688
- You see, that's why I love this city.
- Hmm?

690
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,398
I've lived here my whole life, and...

691
00:41:36,982 --> 00:41:38,702
the place never stops
unfolding new secrets.

692
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:39,735
Hmm.

693
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,280
Yeah, you know...

694
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:44,699
despite the crime,

695
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:46,242
and the darkness,

696
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:48,953
every once in a while,
New York makes me feel...

697
00:41:49,995 --> 00:41:51,372
Like, safe?

698
00:41:51,456 --> 00:41:53,291
- Yes, is that weird?
- Well...

699
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:54,709
- Huh.
- I get it.

700
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:58,003
I wish you could see this place.

701
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:02,717
I can, if you describe it to me.

702
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:06,846
So, anyways, my favorite part...

703
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,348
is the ceiling.

704
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:14,312
So, it's literally dripping
with thousands of lights.

705
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:16,231
They're shaped like chili peppers...

706
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:20,776
which sounds really tacky, I know,
but it's, um, it's not.

707
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:23,904
Just...

708
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,781
It's magic.

709
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,832
This is me.

710
00:42:39,712 --> 00:42:41,088
Are you sure you don't...

711
00:42:41,171 --> 00:42:42,798
live two more blocks?

712
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:45,175
- Maybe three?
- I wish.

713
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:49,430
We could sit.

714
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:50,515
Yeah.

715
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:05,280
All right, I'm gonna kiss ya.

716
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:28,177
You could come up...

717
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:30,805
if you like.

718
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:35,142
I would love to.

719
00:43:39,104 --> 00:43:40,398
But you won't.

720
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:43,401
Not tonight.

721
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:47,655
- It's okay.
- Can I...

722
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,532
Can I tell you why?

723
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:53,661
Because I have this...

724
00:43:55,204 --> 00:43:57,957
incredible ability to bring...

725
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,002
disaster to the best things in my life
and tonight has been perfect.

726
00:44:03,463 --> 00:44:05,673
Don't you think?

727
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:08,926
Yes.

728
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:14,849
And if I stop now, then I get to keep
this one perfect night.

729
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:20,813
And also have the chance
of keeping it going tomorrow.

730
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:27,945
And the day after...

731
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:37,204
And the day after that...

732
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:39,206
And the...

733
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:41,417
Exactly.

734
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,346
Then I guess it's good night...

735
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,265
Mr. Murdock.

736
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:00,686
Good night, Ms. Page.

737
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:45,648
Fix me up, man?
Fix me up.

738
00:45:47,817 --> 00:45:50,360
I know who you are, man!
I know who you are!

739
00:45:54,907 --> 00:45:57,452
How much you got, man?
How much you got?

740
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:06,711
Oh, Jesus Christ.

741
00:46:06,794 --> 00:46:09,922
When I get out of this...

742
00:46:12,132 --> 00:46:14,760
Oh, I'll remember your faces.

743
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:16,762
Every single bit of them...

744
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:20,850
- I will hunt you!
- Aw...

745
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:22,518
When you get out?

746
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:24,562
Where did you find him?

747
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:27,690
Monte Carlo.
I wasn't lying.

748
00:46:28,816 --> 00:46:32,027
He's been going by an alias for years now.

749
00:46:32,111 --> 00:46:34,655
Al Marino.

750
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:37,908
An ugly name for an ugly man.

751
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:39,744
Oh, you're dead.

752
00:46:39,827 --> 00:46:41,704
Both of ya!

753
00:46:41,787 --> 00:46:43,998
Couple of kids playing house!

754
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,583
Hey!

755
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,209
Watch your tongue.

756
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:48,418
While it's still attached.

757
00:46:49,962 --> 00:46:52,757
He tried to hide.
Went underground.

758
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,593
But the scum always rises.

759
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:58,513
Al just couldn't stay anonymous.

760
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:00,515
He had to spend his blood money.

761
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:02,432
Make a splash.

762
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:04,018
Be the big man.

763
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:05,770
You made it easy for me.

764
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:07,229
Eat shit.

765
00:47:08,523 --> 00:47:10,190
Want me to hit you again?

766
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:13,360
Well, I won't.

767
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:14,820
But he will.

768
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,168
I don't know him from Christ,
but one look and I can tell.

769
00:47:30,502 --> 00:47:33,088
Pretty boy ain't got it in him.

770
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:35,465
You don't remember me?

771
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:40,304
You killed my father.

772
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:42,514
Well, I hate to break it to you, son...

773
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:45,601
but I killed a lot of guys' dads.

774
00:47:45,685 --> 00:47:47,144
Then let me help you.

775
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:49,855
He hit hard.

776
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:52,357
Like this.

777
00:48:12,461 --> 00:48:13,921
You call that hard?

778
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:16,215
Let it out.

779
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:17,341
Let it out.

780
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:20,052
Okay? Whatever's inside you.

781
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:22,012
Do it for your father, Matthew.

782
00:48:22,096 --> 00:48:23,598
Do it for us.

783
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:25,265
Come on.

784
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:26,976
"Matthew"?

785
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:31,731
You're Battlin' Jack's boy!

786
00:48:31,814 --> 00:48:34,066
Oh, you amateur.

787
00:48:34,817 --> 00:48:36,777
Now I know your name.

788
00:48:37,778 --> 00:48:42,992
Nothing'll stop me from bloodying
the street with your corpse.

789
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:46,078
Just like I did to your old man!

790
00:48:49,749 --> 00:48:51,208
Yes.

791
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:07,516
End it.

792
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,851
End it now.

793
00:49:08,934 --> 00:49:10,560
- What?
- Keep going.

794
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:13,814
No, that's, uh...

795
00:49:15,482 --> 00:49:18,277
- No, that's all I got.
- No...

796
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,987
He knows your name.

797
00:49:20,988 --> 00:49:22,531
Cut his throat.

798
00:49:22,614 --> 00:49:23,824
Kill him.

799
00:49:23,908 --> 00:49:25,075
What?

800
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:27,286
Kill him.

801
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:36,962
I can't do that.

802
00:49:38,255 --> 00:49:41,425
We can do anything together.

803
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:43,010
Remember?

804
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:55,480
No, I can't.

805
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:04,656
I thought you understood me.

806
00:50:05,615 --> 00:50:07,367
Yeah, I thought I did, too.

807
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,580
We need to call the police.

808
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:25,219
- <i>911, what is your emergency?</i>
- Um...

809
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:29,014
Yes, I'd like to report
the location of a wanted felon.

810
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:32,852
The name is Roscoe Sweeney.

811
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:34,603
<i>What is the address?</i>

812
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:06,718
See? You missed me, too.

813
00:51:13,475 --> 00:51:15,352
Did you have a nice dinner?

814
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:24,694
Elektra, I came here
to ask you a question,

815
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:26,947
and I'd like for you to answer it.

816
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,832
Why did you take me to that mansion?

817
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:40,752
That's your question?

818
00:51:42,421 --> 00:51:43,672
For fun.

819
00:51:45,465 --> 00:51:46,675
For fun?

820
00:51:48,718 --> 00:51:50,095
That's fun for you?

821
00:51:51,763 --> 00:51:53,682
To try to push me into killing a man?

822
00:51:53,765 --> 00:51:54,892
Oh...

823
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:59,646
I didn't push you into anything.

824
00:52:01,148 --> 00:52:02,900
And you didn't kill anyone.

825
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:05,820
- But you wanted to.
- No, I didn't.

826
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:08,280
Don't do that, don't...
Not now, don't...

827
00:52:08,363 --> 00:52:10,449
You act like you have some
window into my soul,

828
00:52:10,532 --> 00:52:12,827
but you don't,
and you never have.

829
00:52:15,454 --> 00:52:19,208
There was always this glorious
darkness inside you.

830
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:20,375
No.

831
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:23,128
That's why I took you to Roscoe Sweeney's.

832
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:27,674
And, yes.

833
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:30,510
That's why I loved you.

834
00:52:34,098 --> 00:52:36,016
That's why you loved me, too.

835
00:52:37,977 --> 00:52:39,854
Don't deny what we have.

836
00:52:42,314 --> 00:52:43,440
Please.

837
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:47,069
You think that's what love is?

838
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:52,699
Someone... someone's coming.

839
00:52:54,534 --> 00:52:56,203
Mmm-hmm.

840
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:58,330
The elevator's moving...

841
00:52:58,413 --> 00:52:59,623
There's...

842
00:52:59,706 --> 00:53:01,666
There's a silencer in the lobby.

843
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:04,044
Who is it, Elektra?

844
00:53:04,128 --> 00:53:05,963
If I had to guess, Yakuza.

845
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:08,840
No.

846
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:11,385
No, that's impossible.
I took care of the Yakuza.

847
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:14,138
Clearly, you didn't.
Hold my gloves?

848
00:53:15,597 --> 00:53:19,434
Today, at the Yakatomi Building,
I infiltrated Asano,

849
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:22,229
the Japanese branch of Roxxon,

850
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:24,523
and I planted a little bug
to crash their system.

851
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:26,691
Yeah, I heard it.

852
00:53:26,775 --> 00:53:28,986
You knew they'd come for you?

853
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:30,779
Well, I knew they'd come here.

854
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:34,033
This building isn't in my name.
I'm no amateur.

855
00:53:34,116 --> 00:53:36,160
Hold on a second,
did you know I'd come?

856
00:53:37,077 --> 00:53:38,662
My confidence was high.

857
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:42,582
You planned this.

858
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,353
Everything you said in the apartment,
it's just lies.

859
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,840
You don't mean it,
you're not sorry...

860
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,920
It's just manipulation with you.

861
00:53:46,925 --> 00:53:48,040
- It's the same thing...
- No!

862
00:53:48,047 --> 00:53:49,422
Over and over again,
you just manipulate!

863
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:50,424
Matthew!

864
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:52,634
- I told you, I know you.
- You don't.

865
00:53:52,717 --> 00:53:54,136
I've always known you.

866
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:56,430
- Then, and now.
- No, you don't know me.

867
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:58,390
So, now, you tell me.

868
00:53:58,473 --> 00:54:01,685
- You can handle them yourself.
- Do I need to push you this time?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
