My name is Oliver Queen.

00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,214
For 5 years, I was stranded

00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,715
on an island
with only one goal...

00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,118

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,553
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,355
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

7
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:20,628
To bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:24,298
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:28,635
I must become...
Something else.

warehouse in Starling City.

14
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:42,082
I could never really tell if the
playboy thing was all an act,

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,183
but I guess after a while,
it doesn't really matter.

He's a vigilante.
He's a damn criminal.

Here's the security footage from the exchange building.
What do you want me to look for?

18
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,425
I want you to look for anything
that's out of the ordinary.

19
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:53,893
What is that? Play that again.

20
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:55,193
Oliver Queen,
you're under arrest

21
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:56,294
on suspicion
of obstruction of justice,

22

00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,145
Ah, come...
hey, I got an idea,

26
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:16,014
why don't you let me
shoot that thing

27
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:18,582

they know who I am.

They think I'm the vigilante.

The man in the hood terrorizing
the city's criminals.

Oliver: This is a mistake.

00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,459
I'll be asking you
a few questions,

56
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,193
standard stuff for the report.

57
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:17,629
Have you been arrested before?

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,929
That's ok, I know the
answer to that one,

59
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,697
plenty of times.

60
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:23,433
Like I said, this is a mistake.

61
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,201
Far as I can tell,
the only mistake I made

62
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:27,937
was not shooting you down at
the docks when I had a chance.

63
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:30,474
I am not who you think I am.

64
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:32,576
Oh, you're exactly
who I think you are.

65
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:35,444
You're a dangerous menace who
doesn't care about who he hurts,

66
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,747
except now you're doing
it with bows and arrows

67
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:39,181
instead of trust funds
and yachts.

68
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,617
Detective... You hate me.

69
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:43,486
I get it.

70
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,121
But that doesn't make me
a vigilante.

71
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,691
No. The security camera
footage of you

72

at the Unidac auction
with a green hood

73
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,527
does that pretty well.
And as I said again,

74
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,529
I ran into the stairwell
once I heard the shooting.

75
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,131
I saw a duffel that I thought
maybe belonged to the shooter.

76
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:02,637
I grabbed it, looked inside and saw...
A hood.

77
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:03,971
And what about harassing
Adam hunt?

78
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:05,774
That just happened
to take place

right across the street from
your little homecoming bash.

80

Those were coincidences.
No.

When they pile up like that,

82
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,181

Detective Lance,
I know you hate my family,

87
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,790
but I had no idea
that you'd go so far

88
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,525
to arrest my son
without any grounds whatsoever!

89
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,893
I have solid grounds,
and I have evidence.

Which you can present to Mr. Queen's
attorney when he gets here.

Until then, this interrogation

He is.

00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:52,517
He blames me for the
death of his daughter.

98
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:55,186
He also thinks that
I dress up in a green hood

99
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:57,388
and shoot people...
With arrows.

100
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,725
The important thing is not to say
anything until your attorney gets here.

I don't think
your ex-girlfriend

105
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,201
can be counted on
to be objective here.

than anyone.

She knows that I could
never be this guy.

Walter, you say Lance
has a vendetta?

109
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,808
Yes.
I think Laurel

110
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,210
can get him off of it.

He raised her
to do the right thing.

112

That includes representing
an innocent man.

126
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:05,419
Yes. I told him
it was a mad idea,

but to be Frank,
I am desperate.

represent him,

Yes.

is why my son,

for all his mistakes,
is so smitten with you.

Where's your attorney,

I'm representing myself, judge.

147
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:05,107
I'm not sure that's the
wisest course, Mr. Queen.

148

I think it is.

149

I'm innocent.

150
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,514
Then we'll consider
that your plea.

Thank you.

152
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:14,216
Now, as to bail...

153

and, well, on the subject
of their wealth,

156
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,756
I would point out that there
is virtually no bail amount

157
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,125
that can guarantee
his presence at trial.

158
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,627
So then I guess
it's a good thing

159
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:29,931

is so circumstantial.

should not deprive him

164
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:43,911
of the right to be
released on bail

165
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,512
while under the
presumption of innocence.

166
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:48,581
He is a flight risk.
Then minimize the risk.

167
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:51,584
The defendant is willing to
submit to home confinement

168
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,987
and electronic monitoring
through the wearing

169
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:57,323
of a UKG45 administrated
ankle device.

170
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:58,858
No, he wouldn't.
Sold.

171
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,159
Your honor...

172
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,328
Bail is set at $15 million.
$5 million bond.

173
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,163
Defendant to see probation

174
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:09,568
for the fitting
of a GPS device.

175
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,403
I knew you couldn't resist
saving my ass.

176
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:13,906
You're going to make me
regret this, aren't you?

177
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,641
No. It's going
to be like old times.

178
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:18,308
Fortunately for you
with the legal case,

179
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,344
there's no way that
you're this vigilante.

180
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:22,179
I agree.
Because he's actually

181
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,548
trying to make a difference.

182
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:25,416
We both know that's not
really your style.

183
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:39,068
Mom. It's not that bad.

184
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:42,238
Ok. This device has a direct
line into the precinct.

185
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,639
Stay on the property,
you're golden.

186
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,981
Any questions?
Yes.

187
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:47,832
I'm having a sizable
get together

188
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,134
here tomorrow evening, and there
is a better than likely chance

189
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,002
it spills into
the outdoor pool.

190
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,737
Pool, that's fine.
Step on the grass,

191
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:55,706
they're sending a SWAT team
to forcibly subdue you.

192
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,974
- Thank you, officer.
- Of course.

193
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,377
A "sizable get together"?

194
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:02,212
I'm confined to this house

195
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:04,147
for the foreseeable future. I might
as well make the most of it.

196
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:05,849
And this party
is going to be themed.

197
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,083
I'm thinking prison,

198
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:10,520
uh, burning man meets
"Shawshank Redemption".

199
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:14,356
The invite says, "come before
Oliver Queen gets off."

200
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:16,392
Maybe a party's not
in the best of taste,

201
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:18,260
you know, considering
the circumstances.

202
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,995
Tommy, the circumstances

203
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,331
are why we're having
the party in the first place.

204
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:25,266
I want people to know that I'm
not worried about any of this.

205
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,536
Well, that makes one of us.

206
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:29,037
Before you start yelling...

207
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:30,906
Why would I yell?

208
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:31,940
You're only defending the man
that killed your sister.

209
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,809
Oliver did not kill Sarah!

210
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,777
If it wasn't for him, she
wouldn't have been on that boat.

211
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,579
Have you consider
the possibility

212
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,213
that that's the reason
you're trying

213
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:40,948
to make him out
to be this... this menace?

214
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:42,883
No, it is the video tape,

215
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:44,284
is the suspicious timing,
that is the reason!

216
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:46,720
This is Oliver Queen
we're talking about.

217
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:49,089
He wrecks fancy cars
and he dates models.

218
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,724
He doesn't kill people.

219
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,893
No, he just uses them,
like he used Sarah

220
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:54,294
and like he used you,
and he's only asked you

221
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,463
to be his lawyer to get at me.

222
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:59,165
No, he asked me to be his lawyer
to get through to you.

223
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,501
You hate the hood
and you hate Oliver,

224
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:04,270
and you want more than anything
for them to be the same person.

225
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,173
But Oliver isn't the reason
why Sarah died.

226
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,008
Or the reason mom left.

227
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,242
I don't have to listen to this.

228
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,311
By the way...

229
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,115
You're not the only
one who misses them.

230
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,985
[Exhales]

231
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,456
[Sighs]

232
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,626
[Knock on door]

233
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,095
Yup?

234
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,865
Thank you for coming.
Shut the door.

235
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,002
I guess it was just
a matter of time

236
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,370
before the police
caught up with you.

237
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:40,471
Except they didn't.

238
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,239
Oliver, they got you on video.

239
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,941
I knew the security camera
was there,

240
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,476
just like I knew the police
would review the footage

241
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,077
and arrest me.

242
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,745
All part of the plan.

243
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,447
So you wanted to get arrested?

244
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:51,882
Well, I returned
to Starling City

245
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,950
and a few days later,
the vigilante appears.

246
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:56,653
Sooner or later, somebody was
going to make the connection.

247
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,489
So what part of serving
yourself up to the cops

248
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,057
will help you avoid going to
prison for the rest of your life?

249
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:02,558
There's more to it.

250
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,993
Well, there better be,
for your sake,

251
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:06,095
because your family is
freaking out downstairs.

252
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:08,564
Oliver, your mother and your
sister just got you back,

253
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:11,034
and now you're going to put them
through a trial, maybe even worse?

254
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:12,435
Don't you care?

255
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:15,004
Of course I care.

256
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,006
The mission comes first.

257
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:23,311
Who is he?

258
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:25,147
Leo Mueller.
German arms dealer.

259
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:27,382
Suspected in the theft
of a hundred m249

260
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,051
squad automatic weapons.

261
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,019
Ok...

262
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,354
Last night he arrived in
Starling City to sell the guns.

263
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:35,156
Oliver, don't you imagine

264
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:36,490
there's enough trouble
you're in this week

265
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:38,025
than to go after this guy?

266
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,560
I imagine what would happen
if a street gang

267
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:41,995
got their hands
on military-grade hardware.

268
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:44,898
I imagine our city's streets
turned into a war zone.

269
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,334
But you're under
house arrest, Oliver,

270
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:49,402
which means you can't
just go after this guy.

271
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:53,373
Look, for now, I would just
like you to shadow Mueller.

272
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,808
I would like you
to track his movements.

273
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:59,011
I want to know
where the buy is happening.

274
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,081
Ok.

275
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:03,749
And how am I supposed
to track him?

276
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,418
Well, you know us
billionaire vigilantes...

277
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,020
we do love our toys.

278
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,172
Ow!

279
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,112
Oooh.

Oh, well, that's sweet.

282

You wanted to see me, sir?

283
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,158
No. I didn't.

284
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,061
In fact, this meeting
isn't taking place.

285
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,899
How long have you been
head of security

286
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,801
at Queen consolidated, Josiah?

287
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,437
Going on seven years now, sir.

288
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,839
Sounds about right.

289
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,741
But what I'm about to tell you

290
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,943
will test the bounds
of your discretion.

291
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:11,012
You're aware
of the "Queen's gambit",

292
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,480
Robert Queen's
ill-fated yacht?

293
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:15,816
Well, I found it.

294
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:19,521
Sir, the boat went down in the
South China sea five years ago.

295
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,356
Which is why my discovery
of its remains

296
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:25,526
in a warehouse downtown was
unexpected, to say the least.

297
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:28,762
I want you to transfer
those remains

298
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:31,698
to a secure location.
Can I count on you?

What's going on, sir?

301
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,673
That's very much what
I'm trying to determine.

No, thank you.

It's nice to get
out of the house.

I'll cut right to it. Detective

without consulting
my office first.

So congratulations.
I am willing

309
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,596
to consider
a plea in this case.

00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:06,898
Absolutely not.

311

Mr. Queen spent
five years in seclusion

312

on a deserted island,
cut off from civilization.

313
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:14,538
It is quite possible
he's suffering from some form

314
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,440
of post traumatic stress.

315

he's a killing machine.

322
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:32,455
Actually, I'm neither.

323
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,890
There is nothing
you can say to me

324
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:36,992
that I would believe.

325
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,862
I'll take a polygraph.

326
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:41,964
Uh, polygraphs
are inadmissible.

327
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,332
In front of the jury.

328
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,167
I'll take a polygraph
in front of him.

329
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:49,538
He's the one
I need to convince.

330
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:51,472
I'm going to need a minute.

331
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,888
You're looking
at life in prison.

332
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,557
What Spencer
just offered you is a gift.

333
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:11,825
I'm not crazy.
I am innocent.

334
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:13,561
I kind of want
to take the polygraph.

335
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:17,097
And if I take it
and I fail, then...

336
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:21,502
I will consider making a deal.

337
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,903
Fine.

338
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:25,104
I'll set up the poly.

339
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,507
And I will tell Spencer
that we're not pleading out,

340
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:30,277
but Oliver, you have a family.

341
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:32,579
Friends. People
who actually care about you.

342
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,748
So don't, for one second,
think you're the only person

343
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,784
with something to lose here.

344
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:42,087
[Exhales] I'll be right back.

345
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:47,660
[Door closes]

346
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:05,109
[Groans]

347
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,179
Please, sit.

348
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,815
You're making me feel rude.

349
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,249
[Breathing heavily]

350
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:21,024
I do apologize for my men's

351
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:23,827
treatment of you.
[Opens can]

352
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:26,095
They're...
they're trained

353
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:29,765
to view any stranger
as hostile.

354
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:35,471
I'm Edward Fyers, by the way.

355
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:40,976
And you are?

356
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,146
I'm Oliver Queen.

357
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,615
I was shipwrecked here.

358
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:51,720
I don't... Know
for how long.

359
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:54,456
My family has money.

360
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:57,492
They have lots of money
you would be...

361
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:02,128
You'd be really well
compensated for my rescue.

362
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,599
Well, I look forward to that.

363
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,134
But for the moment,
let's just talk.

364
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:10,036
About what?

365
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:12,239
Well, for instance...

366
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:17,209
This gentleman.

367
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,212
Do you know him?

368
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:28,287
No.
No?

369
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,722
No. Who's he?

370
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:32,457
You're a poor liar.

371
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:40,866
I've been polite.

372
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,402
I'll offer you one more chance

373
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:45,470
before my manners leave me.

374
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,706
Hey, hey.
I don't know this guy.

375
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:51,709
I thought I was on this
island all by myself.

376
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,979
Do you know what
this island is named?

377
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,881
We're on Lian Yu...

378
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:59,050
mandarin for "purgatory",

379
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:01,752
and I can make it
feel like hell.

380
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:07,324
I don't know
why you're protecting him.

381
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:10,560
You're young, foolish.

382
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,931
Perhaps you don't know
why, either.

383
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:19,102
Think on that when
you're begging for death.

384
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:24,873
He's yours now.

385
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:45,140
Hey, sweetie.

386
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,074
One of the workers left a
keg too far from the bar.

387
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,510
Can you ask them
to move it please?

388
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,711
I got the ankle... thingie.

389
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,414
I don't want to set off
a SWAT invasion.

390
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,519
Hey!

391
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,819
All this stuff?

392
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,721
It's going to be
fine, I promise.

393
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:04,824
Yeah, well, when you and dad
left on the yacht,

394
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:06,893
you promised me I'd see you
in a few days.

395
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:09,163
Which didn't happen.

396
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:10,930
This is different than that.

397
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:14,568
I didn't do any of this
stuff, you know that.

398
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,101
Right?

399
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:18,538
You're out all the time.

400
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,773
You have those scars,

401
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,775
and since you've been back,
you've been acting really weird.

402
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:26,379
None of this makes me
some Robin Hood wannabe.

403
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,382
And you get me this.

404
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:31,416
I mean, it's an arrowhead.

405
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,685
Oh, man.

406
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:38,022
[Exhales] Thea, I bought that

407
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,758
in the gift shop
of the Beijing airport.

408

[Stammering]

409
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:49,600
Now I'm sort of happy
I didn't buy you

410
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:52,236
the shot glass
with the panda on it,

411
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:54,771
'cause then you'd be
worried I was panda man.

[Chuckles]

413
00:19:57,141 --> 00:20:00,511
You know, I knew
you couldn't be

414
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,246
this person.

415
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:04,581
I-I just...

416
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,882
I can't lose you again.

417
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,252
Deal.

418
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,225
Moira. Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

419
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:18,227
Yes. Could you please
make this quick?

420
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:20,596
I'm in the midst of somewhat
of a family emergency.

421
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,064
Yes, of course.

422
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:23,432
It's all over the local news.
[Chuckles]

423
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:26,102
Possibly even national.

424
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:28,537
Well, I know what you're thinking.
Do you?

425
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:31,039
My son is not the man
targeting the list.

426
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,574
The charges are preposterous.

427
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:33,908
Not according to the
district attorney,

428
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:35,611
assistant district attorney,

429
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:37,613
investigating Detective
in the police department

430
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:39,147
that filed charges against him.

431
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,950
That Detective has a
vendetta against my family.

432
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:44,385
Why? Is there
something untoward

433
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:47,388
about your family?

434
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:50,291
If so, something really needs
to be done about that.

435
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,961
Is your name Oliver Queen?

436
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,664
You don't know
who I am, Detective?

437
00:20:56,665 --> 00:21:00,099
The questions are to
calibrate the polygraph.

438
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,568
Is your name Oliver Queen? Yes.

439
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,069
Were you born in Starling City

440
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,238
May 16th, 1985?

Yes.

00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:07,907
Is your hair blue?
No.

443
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:10,443
Have you ever been to
iron heights prison?

444
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:12,111
No.

445
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,085
Are you the man
in this picture?

446
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:24,823
Where can I find the man
in this picture?

447
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:27,125
No.

448
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,635
You steal 40 million
dollars off Adam Hunt?

449
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:40,305
No, I didn't.
Were you marooned

450
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:41,706
on an island called Lian
Yu for 5 years? Yes.

451
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:43,007
How is that even relevant?

452
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:44,309
I don't need to show relevance,

453
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,310
but since you asked,
whatever happened

454
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:48,812
to your client on that island turned
him into a cold blooded killer.

455
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:55,819
No!

456
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,488
The physician that
examined you reported that

457
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,724
20% of your body is
covered in scar tissue.

458
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,426
[Screaming]

459
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:07,930
The machine won't work
unless you ask a question.

460
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:10,065
Did that happen to you there?

461
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,400
Yes.

462
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:13,035
When you came back,

463
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:16,038
you told everyone that you
were alone on that island.

464
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,741
Are you claiming
that your scars were...

465
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:20,242
Self-inflicted?

466
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:21,710
No.

467
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:23,778
I wasn't alone.

468
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,747
I didn't want to talk about what
happened to me on the island.

469
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:27,382
Why not?

470
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:29,751
Because the people
that were there tortured me.

471
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:33,088
Have you killed anyone?

472
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:44,899
Yes.

473
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:49,971
When I asked your daughter Sara

474
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:52,038
to come on my father's
yacht with me.

475
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:59,279
I killed your daughter.

476
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:16,195
I'd have to study the data,

477
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:19,064
but just eyeballing it,
he's telling the truth.

478
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,432
Hmm.

479
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,034
Can I assume that
you'll be recommending.

480
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,603
Ms. Spencer to drop
all charges against my client?

481
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,971
No.

482
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,606
I know a guilty man
when I see one.

483

No. It's just me up here and
I'm on my way back down.

I was in trouble?

00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:00,560
Because when the guy
was fighting you,

654
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:02,829
he broke the ankle monitor.

This is on you.
By accusing my son publicly,

658
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:10,970
you've made him a target.

Do you have any idea
who attacked Oliver?

660
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:16,441
We haven't identified him.
Though it must be someone

661
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:18,443
with a grudge against
the hood, obviously.

I got a call from my lieutenant.

An arms dealer was attacked
across town tonight.

665
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:32,323
By the vigilante. Multiple
witnesses put him there.

666
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:35,793
In light of that, all charges
against your son are being dropped.

No, but I decided

673
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:21,640
to screw propriety after you
tried to have my son killed.

674

I'm sure you understand,

675
00:35:24,444 --> 00:35:26,278
I was justified
in suspecting your son

676
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,948
of being the vigilante
targeting our associates.

Are you ok?

Yeah, I'm fine.

These are your

704

My father asked you if you'd
ever been to iron heights.

705
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:17,784
It's the prison where the
vigilante saved me last week.

706
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:21,387
It's also where you and I went
on our eighth grade field trip.

707
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:24,490
When you said that you
had never been there,

708
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:26,958
I thought maybe
you were just nervous,

709
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:30,128
or that you'd forgotten.

710
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:33,932
But then I looked
at your results,

711
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:38,303
and there is a slight flutter in
your answer to that question.

712
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:40,739
And if you lied on one,

713
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,606
you could have lied on others.

a version of the truth.

she needed to hear, Diggle.
