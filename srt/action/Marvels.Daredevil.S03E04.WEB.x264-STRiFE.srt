1
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,535
Up! Up! Up! Room check!

2
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,748
Convict, stand and face the wall!

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,797
Comb the area.

4
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,676
We'll be conducting
a mandatory sweep of the area.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,304
You're to cooperate with all instructions.
You understand?

6
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,513
I understand.

7
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,598
Check.

8
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,035
I am searching your person
to ensure you're not carrying anything

9
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,313
that might be harmful
to yourself or others.

10
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,439
Do you understand?

11
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,523
I understand.

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,608
Check.

13
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,610
Turn around.

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,539
Are we finished here?

15
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,709
All clear.

16
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,945
Oh, these mornings
are getting colder and colder.

17
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,030
Piece of crap can't keep up for nothing.

18
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,115
Where we off to, boss?

19
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,789
Matt shows up alive, then tells me
I'm never gonna see him again.

20
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,792
Only I, Foggy Nelson,
can be ghosted by a ghost.

21
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,882
It's locked.
Like it was the last time you checked it.

22
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,635
We need to get
another dead bolt installed.

23
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,887
A single dead bolt and a measly chain?

24
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,472
Might as well be a beaded curtain.

25
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,015
Foggy, relax.

26
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,393
Relax? Are you even listening to me?

27
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,979
Wilson Fisk wants my scalp.

28
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,064
And for all we know, he wants yours, too.

29
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,787
It's not like you've done him any favors.

30
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,111
And of course Matt wants me to stick
to the sidelines while he deals with Fisk.

31
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,822
Only Matt Murdock is fit
for the real action.

32
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,365
- Just because I'm not...
- What?

33
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,660
Nothing.

34
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,749
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

35
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,668
Foggy, breathe.

36
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,051
Matt was gone.

37
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,594
Now he's back.

38
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,889
Fisk is out, and I have no idea
where that leaves me.

39
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,061
Screw the sidelines. We go on the offense.

40
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,897
Offense? With Fisk?

41
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,109
He has the law and the FBI on his side.

42
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,571
And it's not like we've heard a statement
from the DA condemning his release.

43
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,116
No, no, nothing to jeopardize
Blake Tower's reelection.

44
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,285
God forbid he grow a pair.

45
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,120
Oh, that could work.

46
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,122
Blake Tower growing a pair?
Not gonna happen.

47
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,665
No, think about it.

48
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,043
The best way to protect yourself from Fisk

49
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,671
is to make noise,
is to be out in the open.

50
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,214
Oh, like a public execution.

51
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,924
Like a public call to action.

52
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,344
If Blake Tower won't
do anything to stop Fisk,

53
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,139
then run against him
for district attorney.

54
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,141
If you're already a target,

55
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,810
you might as well be
the first person to take a swing.

56
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,354
No, I'm serious.

57
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,939
The more public,
the more you're protected.

58
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,275
There's no way I can win.

59
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,695
- Well, of course not.
- Thank you for the confidence.

60
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,740
Anyways, we're light-years
past the deadline.

61
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,949
Then run as a write-in.

62
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,827
You base your candidacy on a single issue.

63
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,621
Putting Fisk back behind bars.

64
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,373
You'd bag a few votes.

65
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,626
I mean, not enough to win,
but you'd get the issue out there.

66
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,670
Plus, you'd make a few friends
in the NYPD, and...

67
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,215
that's not the worst thing
for a defense attorney.

68
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,010
Or you could keep checking the locks.

69
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,977
I won't let anything happen to you.

70
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,562
Oh, baby.

71
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,901
Then we better start working
on that swing.

72
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,946
After coffee.

73
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,614
You're buying.

74
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,423
Have you seen my wallet?

75
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,430
This is good?

76
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,432
Yeah, here's fine.

77
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,561
Hey, you paying with card?
'Cause, you know, cash is better.

78
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,770
Wait for me.

79
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,357
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

80
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,964
Hi. Good morning.

81
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,426
- Purpose for your visit?
- I have an appointment with my client.

82
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,469
I called earlier.
I should be on the visitor list.

83
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,511
ID.

84
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,604
I can't find my wallet.

85
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,399
Did I leave it at home,
or drop it in the cab...

86
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,110
- Without picture ID, I can't...
- Just give me one second.

87
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,363
- Sir, please step aside while...
- This is my New York Bar number.

88
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,741
Now, it's not picture ID, I know,

89
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,995
but it did take seven years and cost me
$300,000 in student loans.

90
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,788
Does it, uh, buy me anything?

91
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,878
Name?

92
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,340
Nelson. Franklin Nelson.

93
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,047
- How you doin'?
- Good.

94
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
- You're holding up?
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,928
Matt!

96
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,888
I thought Foggy...

97
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,432
- What's up, Michael?
- Oh, man.

98
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,684
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

99
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,687
- Even if it is in this shithole.
- I'm sure you're wondering...

100
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,606
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said shithole.

101
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,149
I'm trying not to curse.

102
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,569
What's the point of me getting out of here
in 18 months with a degree in psychology,

103
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,195
top of my class...

104
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,239
if I still swear like a goddamn sailor?

105
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,991
- Did it again.
- Well, sorry.

106
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,075
Saint Matthew.

107
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,827
No, come on, I'm no saint.

108
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,663
You and Foggy got 16 years
knocked off my sentence.

109
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,915
If that's not divine intervention, huh?

110
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,002
Where is Foggy?
I've never seen you two apart.

111
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,464
We're not, uh...
We're not working together anymore.

112
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,841
- Aw, man, that sucks.
- Yeah.

113
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:39,263
Listen, I don't want anyone, even Foggy,
to know that I was here, so...

114
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,891
Yeah, I can do that.

115
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,728
- Appreciate it.
- So, what's the big mystery?

116
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,982
Yeah, so, look, you, um...
worked with the Albanians, right?

117
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,069
A long time ago.

118
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,113
- Low-level stuff. Mostly just running.
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,200
But they're offering you
protection in here?

120
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,829
What do you want with the Albanians?

121
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,956
I want an introduction.

122
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,000
If somebody needs a defense lawyer,
I'll make sure to pass your name along.

123
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,755
Glowing review. But, you know,
folks in here, they're murdering bastards.

124
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,341
I want an introduction to Vic Jusufi.

125
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,011
Nobody gets in with Vic.

126
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,138
You can't make it happen?

127
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,146
...and the extra two years added?

128
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,190
What do you want with him, anyway?

129
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,027
Wilson Fisk could've turned
on any crime organization.

130
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,529
I want to know why the Albanians.

131
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,364
What did they have on Fisk?

132
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,288
- Just, uh... let this go.
- No, I can't do that.

133
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,417
- Fisk stays out, innocent people die.
- I don't know shit.

134
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,001
Michael, you can help me.

135
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,085
- No.
- Come on.

136
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,880
You're gonna get me killed.

137
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,099
Get this guy away from me!
I don't know him!

138
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,017
Get him away! Get him away!

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,270
- That's enough!
- Assault by an inmate...

140
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,646
I said nothing.

141
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,857
On my mother! My mother!

142
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,275
Sir?

143
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,118
It's all right.
It's just a misunderstanding.

144
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,279
Mr. Nelson, you need to get checked out
by the nurse.

145
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,363
It's fine. I'm fine.

146
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,574
Then you can say that
on an incident report.

147
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,034
Liability reasons.
Can't let you leave until you sign one.

148
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,997
Yeah, all right.

149
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,081
Follow me.

150
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,437
He's right in there.

151
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,688
Hi, boys.

152
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,735
- Hi.
- Hey.

153
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,120
I brought clothes, mouthwash,
and some leftover chole.

154
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,164
Thanks.

155
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,375
Hey, I'm sorry.
It's gonna be like this all week.

156
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,586
You promise me you'll eat?
Your face looks thin.

157
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,631
Fine. Okay, I'll eat.

158
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,174
I love you.

159
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,967
We gotta go.

160
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,637
What "we"? Is Sami here?

161
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,181
He's in the car,
killing aliens on my phone.

162
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,225
I'd love to see him. Bring him up.

163
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,727
You're working,
and I don't want to be late.

164
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,604
Late? Late for what?

165
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,189
Late for my sister's.

166
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,484
Sami is gonna stay there
for a couple of days.

167
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,611
Sami has a bed.

168
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,572
One that he can't sleep in.

169
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,790
What do you mean? What's going on?

170
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,960
He stays up all night,
waiting for you to come home.

171
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,461
He's been watching the news.

172
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,965
He's... He's scared something
is going to happen to you.

173
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,133
Look at me. I'm fine.

174
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,218
Are you?

175
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,221
'Cause Sami isn't the only one
who's scared.

176
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,891
Let him stay with Nav and the kids.
Get his mind off all of this.

177
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,602
No.

178
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,646
I'll talk to him when I come home.

179
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,107
Look... nothing bad is gonna happen to me.

180
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,067
I was at the hospital.

181
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,736
I talked to the other spouses
waiting outside the ER.

182
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,532
None of those agents thought anything bad
was going to happen to them, either.

183
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,578
I know how much
this promotion means,

184
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,123
- but nothing is worth...
- We can talk about this later.

185
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,712
Sami is going to my sister's.

186
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,591
Make sure you eat.

187
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,941
Face the wall.

188
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,281
Let's go. Turn around.
Against the wall. Against the wall.

189
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,326
Now. Foreheads to the wall.
Let's go, gentlemen.

190
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,244
Spread your legs.

191
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,208
- Wait in here. Nurse should be by.
- Thanks.

192
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,139
Gelsdorf...

193
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,187
Hi. Yes.

194
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,275
I know you said you couldn't meet until
Friday morning, but I found something.

195
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,194
I don't think it can wait till then.

196
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,446
Yes, absolutely. Off the record.

197
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,952
No, only somebody who works
at the FDIC can help me.

198
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,245
You will?

199
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,790
Thank you so much. No...
Yeah, tomorrow is perfect.

200
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,874
Great.

201
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,586
I think I figured out how Fisk
has been skirting the FBI asset freeze.

202
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,910
When's the last time you slept?

203
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,132
He's been funneling his money
through Vancorp,

204
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,215
which is the shell corporation
that owns the hotel,

205
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,345
and he's keeping it in an offshore firm
named Red Lion National Bank.

206
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,097
- Karen...
- That's the smoking gun.

207
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,349
If it's not smoking,
it's at least kinda warmish.

208
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,227
I didn't come to talk about Fisk.

209
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,938
What?

210
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,442
It's Matt?

211
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,238
They found a body?

212
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,450
I promised I would never lie
for Matt again. Not to you.

213
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,118
No, you have to just...

214
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,787
You need
to just tell me.

215
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,211
Matt's alive.

216
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,257
Matt!

217
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,926
Matt, where the hell are you?

218
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,180
He's not here. I called.

219
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,516
Even asked Fran down the hall
if she saw anyone poking around.

220
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,393
She would know. She pokes.

221
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,105
Why? Why would he let us think
that he was dead?

222
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,527
It wasn't Matt that I saw, Karen.

223
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,945
I mean, not really.

224
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,614
It was Matt.

225
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,450
All five feet, ten inches of him, but...

226
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,536
the way that he spoke to me...

227
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,915
something was missing.

228
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,375
Well, that's nothing new.

229
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,045
There's always
something missing with Matt.

230
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:12,674
I used to think that it was...
it was busy lawyer, distracted Matt.

231
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,345
Then I thought it was weight-of-the-world-
on-his-shoulders Matt. But you know what?

232
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,056
It's just Matt.

233
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,895
But it wasn't any of those.

234
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:33,278
I think a part of him
was buried under Midland Circle.

235
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,907
I don't know if he's coming back.

236
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,663
So much for him promising
he'd stop lying to us.

237
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,377
Letting us think he was dead.

238
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,171
A whopper.

239
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,972
I think Matt's made his choice.

240
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,019
It doesn't really leave any room
for either of us.

241
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,022
No.

242
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,985
I guess it doesn't.

243
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,498
Well, I am not going to sit here
and wait for Matt to come to his senses.

244
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,126
Fisk is out, and he has to be stopped.

245
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,505
Fran was wrong.

246
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,884
I guess she didn't poke hard enough.

247
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,654
Sorry again for the wait.

248
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,872
But, good news, it's not dislocated.

249
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,249
Great. So I can go?

250
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,918
Almost done.

251
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,378
Honestly, this paper work
is a waste of time.

252
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,797
It just ends up in a file somewhere.

253
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:22,179
I am now going to check your pupils
to make sure you're not concussed.

254
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,056
- Just look up for a minute.
- No, just...

255
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,724
Give me the paper work, please.

256
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,101
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

257
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,355
I forgot to mention...

258
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,316
if you come down with any headaches
the next couple of days,

259
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,567
make sure that you...

260
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,053
Come on.

261
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,515
God damn it.

262
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,248
You're not
Franklin Nelson.

263
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,126
Fisk.

264
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,713
It's quite something to see.

265
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:42,801
For a blind man, you have
very impressive reflexes, Mr. Murdock.

266
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,179
What was I injected with?

267
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,684
Do you remember
the last time that we spoke?

268
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,190
You said that, for the cost of postage,
you could prevent my reunion

269
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,152
with the only person
who gives my life meaning.

270
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,071
The only person that I love.

271
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,160
And I would've let bygones be bygones.

272
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,958
But you didn't just threaten me...

273
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,089
you threatened Vanessa.

274
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:27,596
And that is something
that I cannot forgive.

275
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,389
Listen to me very carefully.

276
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,083
Is that him?

277
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,921
Where'd he go?

278
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,574
Hey. Come here.
Come on. Let me outta here.

279
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,535
Where you going? Hey, come back.

280
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,869
Hey, come back, man.

281
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,541
On the ground!

282
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,209
Hold on. I was attacked.

283
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,732
- Get on the ground now!
- I was attacked. I need help.

284
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,214
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Okay.

285
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,590
All right, we got him.

286
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,133
We'll take care of him.

287
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,081
Hey, nice job, homes.
Grab his keys, quick.

288
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:30,589
Code 33, code 33...

289
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,674
Lockdown is now in effect.

290
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,802
Code 33, code 33...

291
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,764
Lockdown is now in effect.

292
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,936
Light it up, Vic!

293
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,233
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

294
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,236
Lockdown is now in effect.

295
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,240
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

296
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,201
Lockdown is now in effect.

297
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,592
Fisk betrays everyone!

298
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,387
He will turn on you.
Fisk will turn on you, too.

299
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,599
Who are you?
And why does Fisk want you dead?

300
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,774
Hey, wait...

301
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,734
What is that? Albanian?

302
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,904
- Are you Vic?
- You're an idiot coming here.

303
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,114
Fisk still controls
half the guards and prisoners.

304
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,700
Yeah, but not... not the Albanians.

305
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,912
Not since Fisk
ratted your people out to the FBI.

306
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,879
What's it to you?

307
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,385
Fisk hates me
as much as he hates you people.

308
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,846
I helped get him locked up.
And I'm gonna do it again.

309
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,349
Nah, I think you're gonna die in here.

310
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,937
Why did Fisk flip on your people?

311
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,271
It doesn't matter.

312
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,024
It matters enough
that you're desperate to kill him.

313
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,569
You missed him in here,
and then you tried again on the outside.

314
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,407
That is a very serious allegation.

315
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,991
And wrong.

316
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,828
We never tried to hit him... in here.

317
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,914
Fisk was shanked in the weight room.

318
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,793
- Not by us.
- Oh, yeah? If not you, then who?

319
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,428
Listen, if I succeed,
Fisk ends up right back here

320
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,471
with you and your men.

321
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,183
And after that, you can do with him
whatever you please.

322
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,651
Fisk shanked Fisk.

323
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,862
He bribed some lifer to stab him.

324
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,032
He set the whole thing up?

325
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,077
The guy sliced him up
just good enough to convince the feds.

326
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,411
Of course.

327
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,374
This guy, he's a lifer?

328
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,544
If he was bribed,
does that mean he's still alive?

329
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,088
Better than alive. Free.

330
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,967
Free?
How is he not in solitary?

331
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,012
Fisk got someone to cook the books
and let him out.

332
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,308
Okay, there are guards coming.

333
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,809
Give me the lifer's name.

334
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,979
He's the only proof we have
that Fisk set this whole thing up.

335
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,731
- So what?
- So if I can get to him, I can...

336
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,442
- You can barely get to your feet.
- Vic, please.

337
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,112
You took a shot at Fisk, and you missed.

338
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,197
I won't.

339
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,741
Not if you can get me out of here.

340
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,411
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

341
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,122
Lockdown is now in effect.

342
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,167
Drag that guard in here.

343
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,848
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

344
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,645
Blood was lost
during the motorcade attack.

345
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,147
My baby cousin's blood.

346
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:20,276
Find the inmate who shanked Fisk.
Make good on your word.

347
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,736
Or we'll come find ya.

348
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,656
His name?

349
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,283
Jasper Evans.

350
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,662
Get him outta here.

351
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,997
Wait, hold on a second.

352
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,123
There's two guards.

353
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,210
Okay, now.

354
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,678
- This way.
- There's an exit this way.

355
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,924
There are two guards.
Trust me, please.

356
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,593
Lockdown is now in effect.

357
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,722
We need to go through
this door on the left. Here.

358
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,807
It's locked.

359
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,810
There's a key in your top left pocket.

360
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,314
Toward the exit! The other way!

361
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,399
Hurry.

362
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,442
There he is!

363
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,570
Move! Now!

364
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,904
Get him! Go!

365
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,878
Code 33, code 33, code 33.

366
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,671
The other way. The other way.

367
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,010
Slow down. Thank you. Thank you.

368
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,181
Inmate! On your knees!

369
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,260
Lockdown is now in effect.

370
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,278
- I can't see.
- Left. Left.

371
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,849
Now take a right. Sharp right.

372
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,187
I got a civilian here!
Get him out. Go.

373
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,231
Go! Go!

374
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,875
Open the gate! Open the gate!

375
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,627
Open the gate!

376
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,405
Drive. Drive.

377
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,532
Drive.

378
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,244
Drive.

379
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:59,639
If I'm being honest, that's not
the way I thought this was gonna go.

380
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,392
Who eats a burger with a spork?

381
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,984
- Special Agent Poindexter.
- Ma'am.

382
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,071
This is Supervisory Special Agent Winn
with OPR.

383
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,489
Poindexter.

384
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,950
Why don't you go grab a cup of coffee?

385
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,828
Yes, sir.

386
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,925
Dex.

387
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,847
- Don't sweat this.
- Sweat what, exactly?

388
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,934
OPR wants a private interview with Fisk.

389
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,354
And I'm the only one
asked to leave the room.

390
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,899
It would be inappropriate of me

391
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,485
to tell you that
the Office of Professional Responsibility

392
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,864
has launched an internal investigation
into the motorcade attack.

393
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,576
It would also be inappropriate of me

394
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,828
to tell you that there was
a slight discrepancy

395
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,790
between your official report
and the forensic analysis of the shooting.

396
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,335
Yeah, it would be inappropriate
for you to tell me all this.

397
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:19,093
Because of you,
my wife still has her husband...

398
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,054
and my son still has his father.

399
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,429
Detective!

400
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,518
The hell are you doing here?
This is a union-only function.

401
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,687
You know what I love about our dynamic?

402
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,272
We skip the pleasantries.

403
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,150
No hellos. No how-you-beens.
Straight to business.

404
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,111
I'm about to get to the business
of dragging your ass up outta here.

405
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,739
I wouldn't have intruded
if it wasn't important.

406
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,991
Let me guess. You need a favor.

407
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,534
See?

408
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,537
Do you have this kind of shorthand
with anyone else?

409
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,207
Wilson Fisk.

410
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,961
His cushy new situation

411
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,631
is a federally-funded slap in the face
to every officer in this room.

412
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,924
No shit.

413
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,927
Not sure what that has to do with you
crashing this party, though.

414
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,764
I want to say a few words,
express my solidarity.

415
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,933
And it would play better
if you gave me the floor.

416
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,894
- Just to say a few things.
- It's been a long week, Foggy, okay?

417
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,896
And you talking is only gonna drag it out.

418
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,439
Now, it's time to go.

419
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,984
In handcuffs or on your own.

420
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,071
Say no more.

421
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,910
Hey, Brett, how's it going?

422
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,673
Excuse me, esteemed constables.

423
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,427
Guys, could I have...

424
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,097
Hey, Counselor,
I personally wanna thank you

425
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,851
for springing my arson perp out of jail
on a technicality.

426
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,313
Come on. There were mitigating
circumstances, and you know it, Officer.

427
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,676
His building was not up to code.

428
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,442
Let me show you where to stick
your mitigating circumstances.

429
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,611
Hey, hey, hey, people, look, um...

430
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,742
Nelson's all right.
He helped the city put Fisk behind bars.

431
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,993
Give him a minute.

432
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,120
One minute.

433
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,627
Officers, I don't mean to disappoint.

434
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,423
But I'm not here to talk
only about Wilson Fisk.

435
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,467
With his name on everyone's lips,

436
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,513
he's getting far more publicity
than any cop killer deserves.

437
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,223
His name deserves to be buried...

438
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,936
buried in the same hard earth
where he put your fallen brothers.

439
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,732
I'm here to talk about Blake Tower...

440
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,526
our honorable district attorney.

441
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:27,948
Here's a man charged with ensuring
the safety of this city, just as you are.

442
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,410
And yet, he stands idly by

443
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,288
while the feds whisk that monster
out of prison

444
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,290
and into the warm lap of luxury.

445
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,334
Someone smarter than me...

446
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,836
That's a pretty freakin'
low bar, isn't it?

447
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,050
That man said, "The only thing
necessary for the triumph of evil

448
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,219
is for good men to do nothing."

449
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,307
Blake Tower is a good man doing nothing.

450
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:59,313
Which is why I'm running my own
write-in campaign for district attorney,

451
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:04,568
to oust Blake Tower and to put Wilson Fisk
into the deepest prison hole allowable

452
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,278
under the Eighth Amendment.

453
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,657
And I would love nothing more
than to do that

454
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,452
with the endorsement of each of you
and your illustrious union.

455
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,005
All right, where do I sign up?

456
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,574
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

457
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,451
Hey, what's up, yo?

458
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,370
Look at shorty comin'.

459
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,957
Hey, hey, let me get your name.

460
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,917
- Let's go around.
- What we getting into?

461
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,336
What's up, y'all?
Let me get your names.

462
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,299
Come on!
What we getting into tonight?

463
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,676
Where you going, Ma?
We got all night!

464
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,929
See, that ass is walking away, bro.

465
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,267
Yo, that's all you, bro.
That's all you, bro.

466
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,644
Now, this is a real lady.

467
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,272
Come here. You coming to say hi?

468
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,984
We could have some fun tonight.
Yeah, you like fun?

469
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,694
Get out of my way.

470
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,865
You got bite.
Come on, play with us.

471
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,077
Let's play a game.

472
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,790
What do you wanna play?
The one where I play scared little girl?

473
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,434
'Cause it seems you like scaring girls.

474
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,336
It's all good.
We was just having fun.

475
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,339
Let's have fun. Huh?
Who goes first? You? Me?

476
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,383
Lady, we were just being friendly.

477
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,302
Then this is just a friendly reminder

478
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,721
that games like that
can get your head blown off.

479
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,973
Why are you still here?

480
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,290
Trouble at home?

481
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,834
Um, no, I...

482
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,379
Actually, that's none of my business.

483
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:35,135
No, no. Um...
I could use some help, advice.

484
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,471
I don't know.

485
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,017
You've taken fire before, right?

486
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,185
Enough.

487
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,729
You have kids at the time?

488
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,441
Your boy having trouble with the shooting?

489
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,361
Yeah.

490
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:57,283
Yeah, he's, uh, not sleeping, you know...
watching the news.

491
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,910
Stuff like that.

492
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,499
I mean, I think the best thing to do
is talk to him like a man.

493
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,876
Tell him that the job I do
is dangerous, but I...

494
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,296
My advice... don't.

495
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,089
I tried that with my daughter.

496
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,632
It freaked her out so bad,

497
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,218
she wouldn't let me
leave the house in the morning.

498
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,888
She lay across the door and cried
until I called in and took the day.

499
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,891
Treat your son like a CI.

500
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,605
Make my kid my snitch?

501
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,065
Snitch lives in a scary world
they don't control,

502
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,484
and they depend on you to keep 'em safe.

503
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,611
Sound familiar?

504
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,406
Yeah, but lying to my son...

505
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,618
My dad was a trucker.

506
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,953
He mostly hauled chemical tankers.

507
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,915
He'd bring 'em to the house overnight
before heading out sometimes.

508
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,252
And I'd have nightmares,
thinking about what could happen.

509
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,838
But when my dad found out,

510
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:57,092
he showed me a diamond-shaped decal
on the back with the colors and numbers.

511
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,304
He told me the numbers tell you
how high the level of danger is.

512
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,140
He only hauled level four, safest stuff.

513
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,768
Once I knew that,
it didn't seem so scary anymore.

514
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,565
- Level four is the most lethal code.
- But I didn't know that.

515
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,110
And I didn't worry when he drove off
every morning in a rolling fire bomb.

516
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,031
The lies that keep us safe
are the ones worth telling.

517
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,040
Coming?

518
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,044
Ms. Page? What are you doing here?

519
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,879
I know we had an appointment for tomorrow,

520
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,003
but what we have to talk about
can't wait till then.

521
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,049
This is my home.

522
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,893
- My family is upstairs.
- I know. I'm sorry.

523
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,345
You're lucky I'm willing to talk to you,
period.

524
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,806
If my bosses at the FDIC
found out I was talking...

525
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,474
Red Lion National Bank.

526
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,186
And how the hell did you get my address?

527
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,772
- Did Ellison put you up...
- No. Ellison doesn't know that I'm here.

528
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,496
He doesn't know that I reached out to you.
I know that looks bad...

529
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,325
And if you did,
you wouldn't be standing here.

530
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,155
The sooner you tell me about Red Lion,
the sooner I go.

531
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,450
Wilson Fisk is laundering his money
through that bank.

532
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,951
We're talking millions of dollars.

533
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,746
- Honey, who's at the door?
- Someone from work.

534
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,956
The FDIC has to be monitoring
a bank involved...

535
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,039
We're done here.

536
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,417
Hey! No, I just...

537
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,252
I need proof.

538
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,088
Give me a contact at the bank.

539
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,299
I'll be having words
with Ellison in the morning.

540
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,177
Give me a name,
you will never see me again.

541
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,304
Honey, what's going on?

542
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,684
There's only one name
worth checking into, and...

543
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,770
good luck squeezing anything out of him.

544
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,438
Who?

545
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,148
Felix Manning.

546
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,610
Thank you.

547
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,696
Thank me by getting
the hell off my property.

548
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,158
Sorry.

549
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,002
I thought you were relieved for the day.

550
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,838
- Is everyone gone?
- Yeah.

551
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,509
Good. Yeah, that's good.

552
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,264
Why don't you go downstairs,
grab a cup of coffee?

553
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,891
My treat.

554
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,561
Yeah.

555
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,814
That's a good idea.

556
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,609
I'll just...

557
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,363
Yeah.

558
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,580
Do you remember these men?

559
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,958
They were among the Albanians
who attacked the motorcade.

560
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,878
- Did you see these men die?
- Yes, I did.

561
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,838
And did you see who shot them?

562
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,968
There was only one FBI agent
left standing.

563
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,053
Special Agent Poindexter.

564
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,972
The moment he shot them,

565
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,516
can you describe, for the record,
what you saw?

566
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,819
They were armed.

567
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:31,283
Special Agent Poindexter
gave them a chance to surrender,

568
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,619
but then their weapons
came up to shoot him.

569
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,123
He killed them both in self-defense.

570
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,838
Thank you for your time, Mr. Fisk.

571
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,556
- What's your game?
- Game?

572
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,393
I don't need any favors from you, convict.

573
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,229
Favors, no.

574
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,272
But sympathy...

575
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,819
Papers, protests...

576
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,904
the mockery.

577
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,576
I can carry this burden of humiliation,
but you?

578
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,787
You're a dedicated federal agent.

579
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,376
You don't know anything about me.

580
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,213
Neither does the Bulletin.

581
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,220
The press is labeling the attack
on my life as an FBI disaster.

582
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,266
And now they're investigating you
for doing your job.

583
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,852
They're questioning you
for your exceptionalism.

584
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,520
You saved my life!

585
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,441
And the lives of honorable federal agents.

586
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,693
Did they report that?

587
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:30,777
No.

588
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,990
Instead, they vilify...

589
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,577
and demean your act of courage.

590
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,806
The world is changing.

591
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,772
The real heroes are ridiculed
and dismissed.

592
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,819
And for that, I offer my sympathy.

593
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,714
Where are we?

594
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,425
Where...

595
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,973
Wait... Hey, hold up. Stop the car.

596
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,934
No problem. We'll get you home.

597
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,728
Who are you?

598
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,067
Hey! Hey!

599
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,864
No, no, no. No.
