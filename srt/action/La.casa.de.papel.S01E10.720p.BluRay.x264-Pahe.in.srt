1
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:08,241
At the moment you don't know each other
and I want to keep it that way,

2
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:10,841
I don't want any names.

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,761
no personal questions

4
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:16,401
or, of course, personal relationships.

5
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:20,361
Profesor.
Miss Tokio.

6
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,121
What are we gonna steal?

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:29,761
La Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:33,601
What happened?
How many hostages?

9
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,681
- Confirmed, 35 workers,
11 security guards

10
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,881
and 17 kids from the British school.

11
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,961
- I'm Raquel Murillo, Inspector in charge

12
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,921
of the management of the heist.
What do you want?

13
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,081
Time.

14
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:46,761
We're locked up and we don't know how long.

15
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,481
Let's assign some chores so
you don't get depressed.

16
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:53,321
- It's 48 m down to the collector.

17
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:54,801
The shifts will be 3 hours.

18
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,161
We'll go out through another tunnel.

19
00:00:56,201 --> 00:01:00,121
Just take it from vault number three.

20
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:03,321
I frisked you, almost stopped you,
and you still cares about me.

21
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:07,001
If you need any kind of help that I can...

22
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,121
Thank you.

23
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,841
- And you have the workshop?
Yes, right next door.

24
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,321
Sorry to intrude, but I can't wait
to try that cider

25
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,041
that you promised me.
Of course you did. Right now.

26
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,361
Did you find anything?
- There was a fingerprint,

27
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,761
but there's no match.

28
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,081
- Check it with the fingerprints of this spoon.

29
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,241
Retroxyl.

30
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:31,321
Used to palliate tremors from degenerative disease

31
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,881
very infrequent neuronal.

32
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:35,561
Since it has to be ordered on demand,
they have the patients

33
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:36,881
very localized.

34
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:38,681
There was an unusual order in Toledo.

35
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:41,041
- Just three days before entering the factory.

36
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,561
Go to that pharmacy by yourself.

37
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,481
Please don't talk about this with anyone.

38
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,681
Help, please, we just got mugged.

39
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,401
- Raquel, I don't know,
the pharmacy's been robbed,

40
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,001
the records have been taken.

41
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,881
- You and I knew about the pharmacy.

42
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:58,321
- You haven't told anyone?

43
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,761
Didn't you say anything to the
weird guy in the cafeteria?

44
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,961
- How much do they pay you?
- Go fuck yourself.

45
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,401
Come on, Salva, look at me under the table.

46
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:09,881
I have suspicions that you're hiding
something in that workshop

47
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,841
where you make cider.

48
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:16,241
I'm sorry, Salva, this place is wonderful.

49
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,241
I got you the results of what you asked for.

50
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,681
Raquel, it's me again.

51
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:25,641
We've got the guy who helps them
from the outside, it's Salva, Salva.

52
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,641
Arturo, can you hear me?

53
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,521
We're in the basement of the boilers.

54
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,801
Have them bring you back. Two hours, two hours.

55
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,961
You take the tools and stick
them under the toilet seat,

56
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,121
on the inside.

57
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:45,561
Okay.

58
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:53,041
Give me one fucking reason not to open
your head right now!

59
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:55,041
They're getting away.
What?

60
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,921
And hostages, he's got six hostages now.

61
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,641
Come here! Come here!

62
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,681
- Aah! Aah!

63
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,841
Listen to me, all of you.

64
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,601
I need you to look for all the farms
with hunting grounds.

65
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:29,001
within a 100-kilometre radius of the pharmacy.

66
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,481
If they bought the drugs there,
it means they were very close.

67
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:34,041
- Inspector, we have the house.

68
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,321
- This house has to be search thoroughly.

69
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:36,401
Every corner.

70
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:39,441
- I'll only go in there if you promise me,
if it goes to hell,

71
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,081
you won't get caught.
I won't promise you that.

72
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,921
We've won the lottery.

73
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,841
It's all on the walls, schedules, photos, plans,

74
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:54,441
the whole damn plan.

75
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:55,761
We got 'em, fellas.

76
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,921
Searching the upper floor.

77
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,281
This room looks like a classroom.

78
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,561
Stools, slate...

79
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,881
There is no human presence.

80
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,841
Inspector, we found something else.

81
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:04,601
- Don't let anyone into the classroom
other than the CSI.

82
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,681
- Count on it.
- Inspector,

83
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,961
the kitchen and bathroom are
full of debris.

84
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,001
Come with me.

85
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:35,601
- What's that?
- It looks like anchovies.

86
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,881
- Anchovies.

87
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,961
- Inspector, the purchasing records

88
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,401
that was stolen from the pharmacy.

89
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,681
They're in a drawer.

90
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,001
- Fucking hell.

91
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,121
The person helping them from the outside
has been here

92
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:55,361
and less than 30 hours ago.

93
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,921
Put surveillance on the adjoining roads.

94
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:04,201
- Attention, cut the roads in 10 km around.

95
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,321
Suspect may be close, repeat,

96
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:08,081
the suspect may be close.

97
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,121
- Acknowledged.

98
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:17,121
"The inspector started secreting
adrenaline and cortisol.

99
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:19,521
His rhythm and blood pressure went up,

100
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:22,481
just like a lioness seconds before she
hunts her gazelle.

101
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:27,161
She was excited and felt the breath
of her prey very close."

102
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,921
We have up to eight different types of prints.

103
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,601
One of them has already been collated.

104
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,401
It belongs to Silene Oliveira, aka Tokio.

105
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,321
"Raquel couldn't stop asking herself questions.

106
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,801
Were those tests a thread to pull

107
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:06,441
or again a dead end to get stuck in?"

108
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,281
This doesn't make any sense.

109
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,561
"And Raquel were right,

110
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,841
because the Profesor had meticulously planned

111
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:53,521
to take the police all the way to Toledo,

112
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,241
so they'd left a fantastic crime scene

113
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,081
worthy of an Oscar and full of people's DNA.

114
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,081
that had nothing to do with the heist.

115
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:04,441
What the Profesor didn't count on was going back

116
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,881
and leave the fingerprints of those the police
already had identified,

117
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,201
Berlín, Río

118
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,561
and me.

119
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:14,161
And by the way, baffle them with some anchovies

120
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,561
and the pharmacy papers.

121
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:19,601
All he wanted was to take Murillo to a dead end.

122
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,041
in which he would lose at least three days.

123
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:34,801
Three very productive days for us,

124
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:37,201
because they give for a lot when you print bills

125
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,121
at eight million an hour; mostly,

126
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:40,961
with the help of the hostages."

127
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,641
Come on, girls, I need this counted
in half an hour.

128
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:45,561
What's the matter with you?
Get a move on, girl.

129
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,561
Look at the smile people work with.

130
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:51,761
To work, to work, that work means power.

131
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,121
"Become accomplices and with the illusion
of one day receiving

132
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,921
by post one million euros."

133
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:00,961
You with me.
- Uoh!

134
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,641
"Something didn't fit.

135
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:15,681
Between those walls there was nothing
they didn't already know.

136
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,881
What the Profesor had calculated
would take three days,

137
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:21,081
the inspector took 50 minutes."

138
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,441
Suárez, call Alberto, have him come
as soon as he can.

139
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,321
- Alberto, your ex-husband.

140
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:29,801
- Isn't he the best of the CSI?
Well, let him come.

141
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:36,321
- Attention, communication with headquarters.

142
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,721
Operational service 315 Toledo estate.

143
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,521
Inspector Murillo requests Vicuña's presence,

144
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:42,601
of the CSI.

145
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,801
"Raquel, I'm Julia, Paula's teacher.

146
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,481
I just wanted to let you know that
Paula's father was here.

147
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:23,521
and took her out to eat.

148
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:25,921
He said it was a family event.

149
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,561
I'd like to meet with you.

150
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,721
No, it's not about Paula, Paula's doing fine,
but her father

151
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,481
wants to buy me a coffee after class and...

152
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:41,681
And I don't quite know how to approach it."

153
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,041
You can't come in.
Sorry, I know the inspector.

154
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,361
Raquel.

155
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,641
- Salva.

156
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,041
Excuse me, I just wanted to say goodbye.

157
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,401
I'm sorry about all this mess.
No, no. You're working.

158
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,681
Don't worry about a thing. It's all right.

159
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,601
I'll take that road, I'll get to town

160
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,601
and some bus I'll find for Madrid.

161
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:21,361
Wait. Suárez, is there a car going
to Madrid now?

162
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,921
- The first batch of evidence comes out
in half an hour.

163
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,841
I really don't want to bother you.
I take a bus and nothing happens.

164
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,161
- Pulling along the road and then all to the right

165
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:32,601
you get to the road.
I thought I saw a stop.

166
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:34,521
Yes.
- Salva, no problem

167
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,801
a companion takes you to Madrid.

168
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,561
Thank you.

169
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,641
- It's about time.

170
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:17,281
- There's still a minute till 6:00.

171
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,121
- Well, given the circumstances,

172
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:23,721
you know where I'm going to get your fucking
British punctuality.

173
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:57,361
Third unanswered call.

174
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:00,761
That's 18 hours without news of The Profesor.

175
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,881
We already know what that means.

176
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:08,881
We'll make a control call every six hours.

177
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:11,321
What if you don't call us?

178
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:13,881
- Or if you don't pick up the phone.

179
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:17,081
If for any reason something
unforeseen comes up,

180
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,361
you'll have to wait for the next call.

181
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,801
and so on to complete a cycle of four calls,
24 hours.

182
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,561
What if in 24 hours we've lost
contact with you?

183
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,801
Then, almost certainly,

184
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:34,081
they'll have stopped me and they'll
be interrogating me.

185
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:46,081
- We don't know anything about the police either.

186
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,841
I'm sure there's something going on outside.

187
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:50,401
What do we do?

188
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,481
- All right, then,

189
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:56,721
there's still one call left to complete
the cycle,

190
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:59,601
at 00:00.
- What cycle?

191
00:14:59,641 --> 00:15:02,841
The fucking mousetrap cycle?
- Denver, relax.

192
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:08,121
The Profesor will be tying up some loose ends.

193
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,961
There's nothing to worry about yet.

194
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:14,281
At the moment we're still watching the hostages

195
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:16,521
and printing money.

196
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:17,841
I'm gonna get some rest.

197
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,361
Are you kidding me?

198
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:28,361
With the problem we have on top of us,
are you going to go fuck now?

199
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:31,401
Tokio, please.
What?

200
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:34,041
There's no need for you to get all ordinary.

201
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:36,561
You don't need it. It doesn't suit you.
That's the first thing.

202
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:41,441
And second, if I had to look
for some ally here,

203
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,961
in this band, on hedonistic terms,

204
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,921
that would be you.

205
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,641
What happened to carpe diem?

206
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:54,001
It happened that the plan fell to
fucking pieces.

207
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:58,041
and maybe you don't care because
you're hopeless,

208
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:00,281
but not me.

209
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:03,121
I'm going.

210
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:05,881
- Son of a bitch.

211
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,241
- Another one.

212
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:09,601
- Are you really fucking a hostage?

213
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,361
Who, that poor thing you got here and there.

214
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:17,081
like I'm a fucking secretary?
- Not poor, her name is Ariadna.

215
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,401
And, yes, we've bonded.

216
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,721
The day we came in here

217
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:26,201
Ariadna trembled in a way I recognize.

218
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,801
That fragility, that delicacy
awakened something in me.

219
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:33,961
- What a shitty speech, 'cause there's
nothing more crawling

220
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,841
in this life than fucking a hostage.

221
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,041
- Ah...

222
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,761
- It's not that bad to be with
a hostage either, is it?

223
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:44,001
What's going on?

224
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,761
I can be accused
of good fucking or bad fucking,

225
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:49,121
but not from fucking at gunpoint.

226
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,161
- Denver, no.

227
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:57,081
- What's up? Yes, I have a relationship too

228
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:59,441
with Mónica Gaztambide.

229
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,681
- What are you saying, son?

230
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,361
- Hell, I saved her life and she hugged
me and kissed me.

231
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,361
I didn't make her do anything.
There was love.

232
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:12,041
- Ay...
- But what love, you little asshole?

233
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,401
Don't you know what Stockholm syndrome is?

234
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,721
- Well, no, Nairobi,
I don't know what that syndrome is;

235
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,001
but if he's got a syndrome or a fucking disease,

236
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,961
we'll get through it together.
- You're not going to get through it together

237
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:25,401
because you're provoking her.
Stockholm syndrome

238
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:29,561
is when the hostage ends up having feelings
for the kidnapper.

239
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:31,721
This girl is scared,

240
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:36,161
but you're a fucking illiterate and
you think it's love.

241
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:38,481
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- That's enough.

242
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:40,281
All right.

243
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:44,321
None of us here are Nobel Prize winners,

244
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:48,761
but we have to stop
throwing shit at each other.

245
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,321
We're in a critical situation.
- No.

246
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,441
In a critical situation we'll be

247
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:56,401
if the Profesor doesn't call in six hours.

248
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,081
And then we would activate the Chernobyl plan.

249
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:07,481
- The Profesor didn't say anything about that.

250
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,241
What is the Chernobyl plan?

251
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:13,001
- If all goes well, you'll never know.

252
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,321
So, please, let's have a little patience.

253
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:19,881
All right?

254
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:23,441
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to empty my mind.

255
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:42,201
- Salva, do you think I should drop the case?

256
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:45,801
I don't know, say I'm not well,
take a medical leave,

257
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,121
to give up.

258
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,801
Well, it's a very intimate question.

259
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,641
That's why I make it for you.

260
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:57,041
We slept together and you know my mother.

261
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:03,121
I mean, it's a question that only you can answer.

262
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:05,761
Only you know how you feel.

263
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:11,801
Well, I feel like all this is too big for me.

264
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:14,401
If they had put someone else in my place...

265
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,881
No, not that, Raquel, no.
If you're in charge

266
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:20,921
of such a crisis is
because no one better than you

267
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,001
knows how to manage it.
I don't know.

268
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,761
Still in the tent, talking to that guy,

269
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:30,801
The Profesor, with whom I do business,
I feel useful there.

270
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:34,881
And I'm confronted with questions like:

271
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:37,601
"What are you wearing?"
"What are you wearing?

272
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,041
Yes, it is.

273
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:42,961
But, I don't know, here, in the open field,

274
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:47,881
I feel he's stronger than me.
I can't deal with him.

275
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:51,561
I don't know. Look at all those people working.

276
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:55,841
30 guys from the CSI and I don't even know
which way to go.

277
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,001
I feel lost.

278
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:06,161
Ay... Sorry, Salva. You're getting late,
aren't you?

279
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:10,041
No, no, not at all.

280
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,921
- Inspector Murillo,

281
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:16,881
the inspector Vicuña, of the CSI,

282
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,481
is entering the perimeter.

283
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:26,721
- Will you come with me?

284
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,441
Oh, sure.

285
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:49,161
- Hello, Raquel. Thank you for calling me.

286
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:51,801
That was a very professional gesture on your part.

287
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:53,841
How's Ángel?

288
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:56,841
- He's still in a coma.
There is nothing new.

289
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,921
This is Salva, a friend.

290
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:06,801
Well, my current partner.

291
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:11,681
Salva, Inspector Alberto Vicuña.

292
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,521
Salvador...

293
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:17,641
Martín. Salvador Martín.

294
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:19,481
Nice to meet you.

295
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:21,081
- Nice to meet you too.

296
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,361
I'm glad you're with Raquel.

297
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:28,201
I'm not bothering you.
I get inside and it's like I'm not there,

298
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:30,481
but you have to tell me the background.

299
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:08,121
What's that?

300
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,761
460 000 euros.

301
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,321
A little pinch, in case we get busted.

302
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:18,241
To start from scratch you and me when
we get out of prison.

303
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:32,001
I'm gonna hide it here, behind our tile.

304
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,361
I'm gonna make a hole with a radial.

305
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:37,481
and I'm going to reseal it.
In a few years we come

306
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,361
and we bought a little flat in La Manga.

307
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,761
That's if the euro still exists, isn't it?

308
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:49,921
Fuck, it's true.

309
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,161
You listen to me.

310
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:59,641
No, don't start that shit again that
you want to leave me.

311
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:03,161
Wait till we get arrested and you leave me
with a letter or something.

312
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,561
You listen to me.

313
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:10,201
Things are gonna get really ugly.

314
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,081
and I'm not one to stand still.

315
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:16,241
I'm more of a shooter.

316
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:17,681
I know.

317
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,881
But you're not.

318
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:23,441
I need to ask you a favor.

319
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:27,961
When the action starts,

320
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,001
you have to turn yourself in.

321
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:35,681
You get a white flag and turn yourself in.

322
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:39,121
That'll serve as a mitigating factor
when things get complicated.

323
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:43,641
When things get complicated,
I'll be with you.

324
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:48,121
When the action starts,

325
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:54,041
I'll be with you in an open grave.

326
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:58,161
And I'll tell you something else:

327
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:02,081
I only take out the white flag
when Madrid wins.

328
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,041
Okay.

329
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:17,241
So, what, we fuck a little?

330
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:23,281
Okay, now's not the time.

331
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,201
Action then?

332
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,361
Action.

333
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:46,441
Hey, come on.

334
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:52,201
- Did you know about that syndrome?

335
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:56,961
- Stockholm syndrome?
Yes, I had heard something.

336
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:01,201
- I didn't make her do anything, Dad, I swear.

337
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:05,401
I brought her food and
she hugged me around the neck,

338
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:08,441
she was looking for my mouth and
you don't know how, she wouldn't let go.

339
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:11,361
That it was real, that I swear we really kissed.

340
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:13,401
I started dancing in front of her and everything.

341
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,401
- Look at her.

342
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:22,401
When have you ever had a girlfriend like that?

343
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,161
- Well, La Vane.

344
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:27,321
- La Vane?
- La Vane was beautiful.

345
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:30,841
- La Vane wasn't pretty, she wasn't smart
and she wasn't good.

346
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:33,961
Because he was from your world and you had
your little things in common.

347
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,801
- What's my world supposed to be?

348
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,121
It's a shitty world, isn't it?

349
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:44,241
- Take a good look at her. Look at her!

350
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:48,801
First, she's an opposition official,

351
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,481
has studied and studied a lot;

352
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,361
Second, her last boyfriend was the CEO

353
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:56,721
of the factory and, third, she's very pretty

354
00:25:57,481 --> 00:25:59,041
and elegant.

355
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:02,121
That woman is from another league, son.

356
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:07,201
He's from the Champions League and we're more about
whether we go down or not.

357
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:09,521
- That's enough. That's enough.

358
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,321
I heard about that!

359
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:19,121
That I'm a piece of shit, that I
have to think like a piece of shit.

360
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,561
and I have to dream like shit.

361
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:22,961
I heard about it.

362
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,481
Freeze!

363
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:36,281
He said freeze, damn it!

364
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:37,761
Hands on your head!

365
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,321
Hey, hey, hey!

366
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:54,681
May I ask what's going on?
It happens that this is very rare

367
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,281
and no one's calling here.

368
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:59,161
And if they're gonna shoot us and
we're gonna fuck off,

369
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,121
unless we find out on TV.

370
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:22,201
It's all right. Mónica Gaztambide,
it's your turn to heal the wound

371
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,921
In the first recognition,

372
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,161
we found the fingerprints of eight people.

373
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:50,561
There's DNA in cigarette butts, chewing gum,
chopsticks, even a yogurt.

374
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:54,521
More than 100 classified tests and
we have a lot more.

375
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,921
Looks like they also wrote the plan on the board.

376
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:01,841
We're trying to rebuild it.
- Have they left the plan written down?

377
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:06,801
- Yeah. Well, that's the question,

378
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,481
if this is a contaminated scene.

379
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,841
or if he responds to a lack of professionalism
for destroying evidence.

380
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:17,201
- They're inside the Fábrica Nacional,

381
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:20,281
I don't think they lack professionalism
or intelligence.

382
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:22,321
None of this is worth a shit.

383
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,041
Ángel went further than you with the prints he found.

384
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,241
- What prints?
- He didn't say anything to you?

385
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:31,921
He got a personal item, a spoon.

386
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:37,281
That's where we isolated the same
fingerprints we found in the zeta

387
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:43,721
Ángel hit on someone in the band or at least
he was very close.

388
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:46,601
If there's anything useful here,
I know where it might be. Come.

389
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:53,201
Everything they really wanted to erase

390
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,921
they must have burned it in there.

391
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,361
It's the safest way to destroy something

392
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:02,161
and that's what we'd all do.
- But there are only ashes there, and few of them.

393
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:05,241
- And those ashes before were firewood, charcoal,

394
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,681
but also documents, photos,

395
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:12,201
a paper that when burned
loses most of its matter.

396
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:15,081
Fire creates scrolls of hot air

397
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:18,841
that elevate those paper
particles through the chimney flue.

398
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:23,121
Sometimes these particles
stick to the rough brick

399
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,401
from the wall.
If there's anything worthwhile, it's in there.

400
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,121
Let us work.

401
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:31,361
Gandía, bring the glasses and the infrared camera.

402
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:44,801
Come on, girl, I'm in a hurry. Come on.

403
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:49,121
Let's get to work.

404
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:02,281
Turn around.

405
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,721
You're serious, aren't you?
No.

406
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:15,561
Can you stop?

407
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:19,041
I will spill the Betadine.
Now, now, the Betadine.

408
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,361
Mónica, I'm telling you seriously.

409
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:35,521
What's the matter, our 60 hours
of love are over?

410
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:38,121
You happen to be a hostage and
I've kidnapped you,

411
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:40,961
so when this is over and
we get out of here, we'll see.

412
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:44,201
What? What's going on?

413
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,401
Come on.

414
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,681
Something happened and I didn't find out?

415
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,921
Maybe you don't realize why you're here

416
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:59,481
against your will, Mónica,
but you have a syndrome.

417
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:04,321
What? What syndrome?
Stockholm.

418
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:08,401
That you fall in love with the son of a bitch
who's holding you hostage.

419
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:11,801
Since you're crazy about it, you treat
me like I'm your boyfriend.

420
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,481
It's a psychiatric thing,
it's treated by doctors.

421
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:15,921
Listen to me.

422
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:18,721
What if I tell you it's the biggest
nonsense I've ever heard in my life?

423
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:21,041
What are you gonna tell me
if you're with the syndrome?

424
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:22,121
No, listen to me.

425
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,281
What if we'd crossed the street?

426
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:27,201
And if I'd asked you for change at a slot bar,

427
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,681
what would you have thought of me?

428
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,801
Would you have noticed more than two seconds?

429
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,881
Really, tell me. Don't you?

430
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:45,121
Well, that's it.

431
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:49,321
You go on your way,

432
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,561
I follow mine

433
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:55,281
and forward.
Wait.

434
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,881
Do you feel anything?

435
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:01,761
Anything for me?

436
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:06,561
I don't have any syndrome, Mónica.

437
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:09,241
Tell me, do you feel anything?

438
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:15,641
Yeah, but mine's real,
it's not from Stockholm.

439
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:20,081
And yours, I can't make it
go away from your head.

440
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,841
I can't.

441
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:24,441
I can't do that to you.

442
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:57,121
What are you thinking, green eyes?

443
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:18,161
I look at you and I want to know
everything about you,

444
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,921
every day you've lived,

445
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:30,121
every smile, every tear,

446
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,641
every moment of happiness.

447
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:39,401
You're a charming mystery to me, Ariadna.

448
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:47,361
For example, let's see, the first kiss.

449
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:54,761
Do you remember who gave it to you?

450
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,881
What was his name?

451
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:01,921
- Raúl.

452
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:10,001
- Raúl had to really feel like a lucky man.

453
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:14,161
and, like Neil Armstrong, walking on the moon.

454
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:22,161
First times are special,

455
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:26,401
unique

456
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:32,321
but the last few times are incomparable,

457
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,001
are priceless.

458
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:45,601
What happens is that people don't usually
know what they are.

459
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:53,161
You see, I've got six months to live.

460
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,681
or four,

461
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,001
maybe even less,

462
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:07,961
and one of the few things I really
care about right now,

463
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,521
You know what that is?

464
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:16,161
To know that I'm going to live here,

465
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:19,561
in here,

466
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:24,041
forever and ever,

467
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:29,641
inside this beautiful little head.

468
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:38,161
Berlín, something serious has happened.

469
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:52,121
Excuse me, the agents who were going to Madrid?

470
00:35:52,161 --> 00:35:54,401
At the moment it looks like no one's leaving.

471
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:58,241
Wow. Well, then I'll take the road.

472
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,881
May I come in and say goodbye to the inspector?

473
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:02,281
Come with me.

474
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:55,241
Are you sure you want to do that?

475
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,801
You should take it all with you.

476
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:07,681
Since tomorrow they are no longer memories,
they are simply

477
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:11,481
evidence against someone who's on a
search and seizure..

478
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:28,401
Nostalgia is seductive,

479
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:30,601
it's hard for us to get rid of the memories

480
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:33,401
because we think the memories

481
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:37,201
are really those happy moments, but...

482
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:43,081
But they're not.

483
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:50,001
And what we're going to do tomorrow requires us
to think about the present.

484
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,201
Not in the past.

485
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,601
That was your father.

486
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,361
And that's all that matters.

487
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:19,641
And we're gonna do it for him.

488
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,641
"So far more than 50 troops have moved here

489
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,281
among which is the inspecting officer in charge,

490
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:59,921
the head of the operational unit GEOS
and officers of the CSI,

491
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:03,441
who continue to work on the house that,
according to nearby sources,

492
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:07,201
could be the place where the muggers organized

493
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,561
the assault..."
The Profesor has been arrested.

494
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:12,681
If he's being interrogated at the
door of the house in Toledo.

495
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:15,001
"The judge has decreed the secret of summary.

496
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,081
CSI could have found evidence

497
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:21,241
that confirm the presence in that
house of at least three..."

498
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,641
Fucking hell.

499
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:28,681
Shit!

500
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:30,761
They've cut off the terrestrial digital signal.

501
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,881
Fucking hell.

502
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:33,521
They don't want us to find out.

503
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:36,361
And if they don't want us to find out,
it's because they're coming in.

504
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,881
We can stand idly by for five hours

505
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,001
or start the fucking Chernobyl plan,

506
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,561
that sounds better to me every time.

507
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:45,321
The Chernobyl plan is for desperate situations.

508
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:46,801
And I don't know if this is the situation

509
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,761
more desperate than we can bear.

510
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:49,921
Is it?

511
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:52,681
Warning, it's a plan in which you'd lose
all your loot.

512
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,601
I personally don't have any desire
to quit, do you?

513
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:02,121
Are you now going to give up everything
you've fought for

514
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,241
so harshly, Tokio?

515
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:06,561
Guys, they've got the Profesor.

516
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:08,721
There's not gonna be a tunnel in the hangar,

517
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:11,361
cause the damn GEOS are gonna be waiting for us.

518
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:12,801
We're in a fucking mousetrap.

519
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:15,041
In five hours, the Profesor will call,

520
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,401
I still believe in him.

521
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:18,281
In fact, I'm not passionate about democracy,

522
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:20,801
but I'm getting a crazy urge to vote.

523
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,841
Who still believes in the Profesor?

524
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:28,361
Helsinki?

525
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:33,321
- I still believe in the Profesor.

526
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,681
- Río.

527
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,721
- I believe in what I see.

528
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:51,121
And what I see is that we can no
longer count on the Profesor.

529
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:54,681
So I'm with Tokio.

530
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:59,121
- Moscú?

531
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:03,441
- I came in accepting a few rules.

532
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:07,001
The rules haven't been broken.

533
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:10,601
I still trust the Profesor.

534
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:19,361
- Denver?

535
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:26,161
- I vote to get out of here, now.

536
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:27,721
Me being a multimillionaire

537
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:30,201
it kind of gets a little big.

538
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:33,481
- Perfect, Denver, three, three.

539
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,961
Nairobi, it's up to you.

540
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:41,801
The tiebreak.

541
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:50,041
- I have a very good reason to be with the Profesor,

542
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:53,881
and if he doesn't jump to pieces,
I'm gonna believe in him to the end.

543
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:57,641
I'm with Berlín.

544
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,921
Raquel.

545
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:23,321
Forgive me, I don't want to bother you,
but it's just...

546
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:25,641
Now I'm getting a little late...

547
00:42:25,681 --> 00:42:27,681
I'm taking this to Canillas.

548
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:30,601
I was just going to Madrid,
I was going to catch the bus.

549
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:35,801
If you want, I'll bring him in.
- What?

550
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:39,321
Well, I could use it.

551
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,641
Let's go.

552
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:05,761
The truth is, I've seen Raquel very well,
and that's good.

553
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:10,561
You know, in a separation, until the
two of them remake,

554
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,801
well it's complicated.

555
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,081
I'm glad too, the truth is that Raquel

556
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:18,721
is an extraordinary woman.
Yes, yes, of course.

557
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,161
I want what's best for her.

558
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:23,361
If she's okay, the girl's okay,
we're all okay.

559
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,561
Are you hot? Shall I put the air in?

560
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:31,121
No, no, the temperature's fine.

561
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:33,161
It's me, I'm a little...

562
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,721
A little stirred up.

563
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:36,641
You haven't had the coffee from the caterer,

564
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,681
that shit should be banned.

565
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:41,921
Well, yes, I made that mistake,
because I had three cups

566
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:43,721
and besides, I have a problem...

567
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:45,801
A colon problem, it's nothing serious,

568
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:47,441
but I have a bacterium that...

569
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,921
Well, which forces me to evacuate

570
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,321
more regularly than usual.

571
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:55,201
It's kind of embarrassing,

572
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:58,401
but I didn't want to poop at the
crime scene either.

573
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:02,441
Do you want me to stop?

574
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:05,161
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd really appreciate it.

575
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:09,081
No problem, the first gas station stopped.

576
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:13,841
Well, I think the best thing for both of us
would be to stop as soon as possible.

577
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:15,601
Look, right here.
Right there?

578
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:18,241
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem.

579
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,401
Thank you.

580
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:48,841
Salva!

581
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:57,921
Salva.

582
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,281
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

583
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:01,241
Yeah, yeah, much better.

584
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:08,961
Let's see what people are like.

585
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:16,041
Alberto, anytime, huh?

586
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:31,761
Suárez, come here a minute.

587
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:35,881
Pilar.

588
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:39,281
Listen, I want you to analyze Ángel's car.

589
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:41,441
- We've already done it, it's procedure.

590
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:43,601
- So? Did you find anything anomalous?

591
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,281
- He had the brake fluid conduit plugged,

592
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:48,561
but it doesn't mean anything.
- What do you mean, no?

593
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:50,721
He could have been manipulated, couldn't he?

594
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:53,121
- It could, but it's usually not.

595
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:55,441
Sealing of ducts, breakage of parts...

596
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:59,761
That's what happens when you do two
overturns at 170 km/h.

597
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:04,401
I'm sorry.
- Wait, wait.

598
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:07,441
Did he tell you where he got the spoon

599
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:10,401
that he sent you to analyze?
- No, no.

600
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:12,361
I have to keep working.

601
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:16,321
Suárez, when did Ángel come to Toledo?

602
00:47:16,361 --> 00:47:18,921
Yesterday, right?
- Yesterday, yes, but...

603
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,041
- It's possible he took her from here.

604
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:23,441
To get to this house before we did.

605
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:27,041
Or... I don't know, maybe he took it
from the village bar

606
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:28,561
or the pharmacy.

607
00:47:28,601 --> 00:47:33,081
Maybe he suspected someone...
- Raquel, Raquel, calm down.

608
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:36,721
That way you won't solve anything,
only Ángel knows where it came from.

609
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:39,401
- Ángel and the guy who helps them from the outside.

610
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:42,761
The same guy who was listening to us through the mic.

611
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:44,921
The same guy who tried to kill Ángel

612
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:46,761
manipulating your car's brakes.

613
00:47:46,801 --> 00:47:48,921
- They just told you that's not proven.

614
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:51,881
- Ángel followed a lead and someone tried to kill him.

615
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:54,121
And he's gonna do it again if he comes out of the coma.

616
00:47:55,161 --> 00:47:56,961
- What are you up to?

617
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:01,761
- This time we'll set him up.

618
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:09,921
"Don't judge him.

619
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:14,121
Helsinki did what it had to do,

620
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:16,801
what soldiers do in war,

621
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:20,121
what we do with animals when we don't
want them to suffer;

622
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:22,961
without hatred, as an act of humanity.

623
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,681
And I did what I had to do, too.

624
00:51:01,201 --> 00:51:02,721
Not out of hatred,

625
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:05,721
as an act of humanity.

626
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,361
After all,

627
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:10,921
what's more human than trying to survive?"

628
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,681
I was just thinking about what you said earlier,

629
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,401
that you want what's best for Raquel.

630
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:39,361
What?

631
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:43,241
Well, I don't think that's true.

632
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:46,561
If it were true,

633
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:49,521
you wouldn't be fucking his sister.

634
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:54,961
Look, that's none of your business.
I'm sorry, but I am interested.

635
00:51:55,801 --> 00:51:58,721
When I heard about your story, I thought:

636
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:02,441
"This guy's got to be really in love

637
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:03,961
to get into a mess like this."

638
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:09,881
Falling in love or fucking your wife's sister,

639
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:13,681
but when I found out that you were flirting

640
00:52:13,721 --> 00:52:17,841
With your daughter's teacher...
Your daughter's teacher.

641
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:20,121
I thought, "This is one of these guys

642
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:24,321
that shares intelligence with the
cock and the muscles,

643
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:27,801
a perturbed man who has to disguise
himself in society."

644
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:30,681
The thing that pisses me off the most is

645
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:34,201
that it's Raquel who ended up going to the psychiatrist

646
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:36,321
when it should have been you.

647
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,441
What are you going to the psychiatrist for?

648
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:40,481
You have no idea what a piece of crap you are.

649
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:43,161
You bastard.
Bastard? Me?

650
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,801
You garbage

651
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:54,201
Get out of the car.

652
00:52:55,561 --> 00:52:57,121
Alberto, if I get out of the car,

653
00:52:57,161 --> 00:53:00,361
I'm going to give you a punch that you're
not even going to stand on.

654
00:53:00,401 --> 00:53:02,441
Get the fuck out of the car.

655
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,641
Do you know what this is?

656
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:44,081
My meds.

657
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:46,841
Days of life.

658
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,441
It seems unbelievable that such a
valuable thing

659
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:56,441
is stored inside something so fragile,
right?

660
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:07,201
It didn't do you any good to lose the election,
Tokio.

661
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:10,761
You should do a little more personal work.

662
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:13,761
I'm not going to stand still.

663
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:16,641
while they go in and kill me for a shitty vote.

664
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,721
You stay if you want,

665
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:23,081
but you don't decide about us.

666
00:54:23,121 --> 00:54:25,161
Is that it? You can go in peace.

667
00:54:25,881 --> 00:54:28,121
No problem, I'll bring you present

668
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:29,241
in my prayers.

669
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:32,121
I've lived with you really beautiful days.

670
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:35,481
- Tokio, please, come on,
they'll come and get us.

671
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:45,641
Berlín, tell us about the Chernobyl plan

672
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:48,241
or I'll blow up your whole arsenal.

673
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:53,041
No, I'm not.

674
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:02,281
Are you really going to torture me
by breaking little glass jars?

675
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:06,041
Oh, Tokio, Tokio.

676
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,601
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

677
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:10,761
So mature for some things and so young for others.

678
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:15,561
You should consider doing something more forceful;

679
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:18,201
severing a limb, for example.

680
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:20,521
Of course, I'm so high on opiates

681
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:22,401
and I may not know anything about it.

682
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:25,721
Denver, give me the gun.

683
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:37,921
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

684
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:49,241
Yes, it is.

685
00:55:56,281 --> 00:56:00,881
Tell us what the Chernobyl plan is.
You don't have what it takes.

686
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:02,841
You don't.

687
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:08,241
Three, two,

688
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:12,321
one.

689
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:21,721
What? What do you have to tell me now?

690
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:24,281
You'll find out.

691
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,321
You're gonna hurt yourself.

692
00:56:29,361 --> 00:56:30,801
There goes the second one.

693
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:39,001
Son of a bitch.

694
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:53,041
Oh! Oh!

695
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,401
The fifth.

696
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:14,761
What the fuck are you doing?

697
00:57:21,201 --> 00:57:23,641
- We're playing Russian roulette, Nairobi!

698
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,801
Come back later!

699
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:30,041
- Shit, Tokio!

700
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:33,321
Tokio, you're losing it.
What the fuck are you doing?

701
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:36,441
You want us all to go fuck ourselves
because of you?

702
00:57:36,481 --> 00:57:39,961
You're gonna fuck up the plan.
- That's clear.

703
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:42,041
All by yourself.

704
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:47,641
Me?.

705
00:57:49,321 --> 00:57:50,961
I'm fucking up the plan?

706
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:55,201
It's just that you can't stop and
think for a second for once

707
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:58,121
fucking brainless.

708
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:01,601
I'm a brainless?

709
00:58:01,641 --> 00:58:04,481
and the plan to go find
your son is bullshit.

710
00:58:08,161 --> 00:58:09,881
What the fuck are you saying?

711
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:12,681
When was the last time he saw you?
Were you three years old?

712
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:14,881
He doesn't have a bloody memory of you.

713
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:17,801
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
He won't recognize you

714
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:20,481
because he already has a mother and a father,

715
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:22,481
that to him they are the real thing.

716
00:58:22,521 --> 00:58:25,441
You don't know shit.
What?

717
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:26,961
You don't know shit.

718
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:29,801
All I know is that you were the aunt
who carried him in the gut

719
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:32,881
and left him to go get some fucking pills.

720
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:35,921
Do you know what's going on?
I'm not listening very well.

721
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:38,321
No?
Why don't you come a little closer

722
00:58:38,361 --> 00:58:40,721
to the door or why don't you open the door

723
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:42,761
and you say this to my face, friend?

724
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:45,641
What I'm telling you is that you missed
the opportunity

725
00:58:45,681 --> 00:58:47,161
of being a mother, face it.

726
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:49,921
Knock it off!

727
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:51,361
- Hey, Tokio,

728
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:55,441
Maybe all this it's getting a little out of,
Isn't it?

729
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:59,281
You didn't want to go to the open grave with me?

730
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:02,281
Well, welcome to the slide.

731
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:07,441
Son, listen to me.

732
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:09,921
Get out of there immediately.

733
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:11,961
You're getting yourself into a very big problem.

734
01:00:12,001 --> 01:00:15,241
- In a very big problem?
What difference does it make?

735
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:17,081
It's all gone to shit.

736
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,681
- Let's see, forget that Stockholm,

737
01:00:21,721 --> 01:00:24,721
we're rushing, there's no one
here who's a doctor,

738
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:29,121
but please don't fuck it up.

739
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:33,001
- Are we going out or what?

740
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:35,441
No, I'm not.

741
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:37,961
Maybe we're just in time to...
No!

742
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:40,201
We've already voted.

743
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:44,361
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

744
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:46,081
That's enough.

745
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:47,881
Here we go. If it is true

746
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:49,481
my time has come, shoot.

747
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:53,401
Come on, Tokio, I'm terminally ill.

748
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:57,441
No one you're going
to cut off dreams and worries,

749
01:00:57,481 --> 01:01:00,241
but if you're playing at scaring him,
think of something.

750
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:03,841
When you bust my head, you're gonna be scared.

751
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:06,721
I'm the only one here who knows the plan.

752
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:10,721
You won't fucking know how to get
out of this mousetrap!

753
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:15,441
It is you who are playing Russian roulette.

754
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:17,121
Do it!

755
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:10,081
Alberto, forgive me, I've let myself
be carried away by passion.

756
01:02:10,121 --> 01:02:13,841
I apologize... Alberto

757
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:33,161
You're under arrest for assault on authority.
Don't even move.

758
01:02:37,401 --> 01:02:39,081
Hold it right there.

759
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:42,041
Romero, I have a detainee.
Attacking authority.

760
01:02:42,081 --> 01:02:43,921
Take his prints and lock him up.

761
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:53,681
Sit down here. I'll be right back.

762
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:24,601
Rest in peace.

763
01:03:36,361 --> 01:03:37,561
Helsinki. Anytime.

764
01:03:44,681 --> 01:03:46,761
Rest in peace, Oslo.

765
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:52,201
The quietest guy in the band and the one
with the worst luck.

766
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:58,361
Then the next one was me.

767
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:35,481
I earned it.

768
01:04:36,921 --> 01:04:40,161
Berlín took advantage
of my teammates' break time

769
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:44,561
to give me what I deserve.
By all means irreversible.

770
01:05:06,161 --> 01:05:08,001
You look like a birthday present.

771
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:13,001
All you need is the ribbon.

772
01:05:18,921 --> 01:05:23,121
What are you gonna do to me?
You should dose your energy.

773
01:05:27,321 --> 01:05:28,721
You're not gonna kill me?

774
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:33,161
No... I'm not going to kill you.

775
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:36,681
Nor am I going to torture you.

776
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:50,601
Son of a bitch. I hate you.

777
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:53,001
Let me ask you something.

778
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:55,721
because this has to be the end
of something, right?

779
01:05:56,441 --> 01:06:01,641
Couldn't it be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?

780
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:06,761
No!

781
01:06:31,841 --> 01:06:33,481
"And that's how it all started.

782
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:38,681
All that would be the end of the robbery,
of the days of confinement,

783
01:06:38,721 --> 01:06:41,401
of my love with Río.

784
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:43,361
Everyone's dreams.

785
01:06:44,361 --> 01:06:45,681
Of my freedom.

786
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:20,801
Sergio.

787
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:26,361
Shall I tell you I've got a date and you
don't have time to hit on him?

788
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:29,681
- The one who knocked me unconscious
is fucking Chuck Norris with glasses.

789
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,961
Fucking hell.

790
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:35,761
Man, Mr. Prieto.

791
01:07:36,561 --> 01:07:40,241
Tokio lost its head, but I had to deliver it.

792
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:43,961
Shut the fuck up.

793
01:07:44,001 --> 01:07:46,321
I'm sick of hearing this guy complain.

794
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:48,601
- If you're so bad, why don't you do something?

795
01:07:50,401 --> 01:07:53,361
This is patriarchy.

796
01:07:53,401 --> 01:07:56,321
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means I'm in charge here.

797
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:09,681
It's a lie. It's a lie!

798
01:08:09,721 --> 01:08:12,761

Who's the profesor?

800
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:23,081

01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:42,441
Reduce it.
- Tokio!
