1
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,640
<i>Good. Stay there.</i>

2
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,600
Matt?

3
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,440
No. I haven't seen him since last night.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,610
I'll let him know what's going on.
Meet you at the precinct.

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,570
And don't let anyone
talk to Grotto until then.

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,240
It was a normal evening
at Metro-General

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,530
when a lone gunman entered
and began firing into the crowd.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,040
Most of the patients are being moved
to other area hospitals.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,290
Investigators say...

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,630
<i>The building's clear.
Perp is not in the building.</i>

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,970
<i>Standby to lift lockdown.
All units hold position.</i>

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,390
<i>We have a report of shots fired earlier
on a rooftop up on 10th.</i>

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,640
<i>- Yeah?
- I lost my keys!</i>

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,220
<i>- Your kid locked you out?
- Yeah.</i>

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,970
<i>You some kind of idiot?</i>

16
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,640
Yeah.

17
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,290
Oh, shit.

18
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,870
No, no, no, no, no.
No! Matt!

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,790
Come on, Matt, wake up.

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,630
You okay, Matt? Come on.

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,880
Get up! Matt! Matt, come on!

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,880
Wake up. Wake up!

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,050
Come on!

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,930
Matt, can you breathe?

25
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,020
Matt. Can you get up?

26
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,190
Hey, Foggy, can I get some aspirin?

27
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,190
You sure you don't want an x-ray?
Maybe a psych eval?

28
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,730
An aspirin's fine, buddy.

29
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,780
You got shot in the head.
You're lucky you're not in the morgue.

30
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,910
It was just a dumb mistake, man.

31
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,410
- What?
- The gun on his ankle, I...

32
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,710
I should've heard it, you know.
I should've felt it.

33
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,330
Are you serious?

34
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,800
Yeah, but he's fast,
this guy, Foggy, he's...

35
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,050
He's trained.

36
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,970
He's a lunatic, Matt.

37
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,470
I went to the hospital.
I saw what he did.

38
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,140
- Where's Karen?
- We've been through this.

39
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,350
Oh, yeah, that's right.

40
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,430
Yeah, you're sure...
you're sure she's okay?

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,690
She got Grotto to the NYPD.

42
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,900
We're gonna meet there,
make a deal with the DA.

43
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,690
Thanks.

44
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,120
Thanks, buddy.
I'm gonna put on some pants.

45
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,080
- No.
- It's okay. I know we need to get going.

46
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,290
"We" don't need to do anything.

47
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,040
- Foggy, I don't wanna do this right now.
- Karen's safe,

48
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,540
you're safe...

49
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,500
and our client will be safe
within the hour.

50
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,170
- It's all taken care of.
- Except the shooter.

51
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,010
He's still walking the streets
of Hell's Kitchen.

52
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,470
- He's the cops' problem now.
- He's gonna plow right through the cops.

53
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
I know what you're doing.

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,970
You saw what he did to the Irish,

55
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,260
you didn't see what he did
to the Mexican Cartel.

56
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,100
He hung them on meat hooks,
and he left them there to die.

57
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,770
- You want another round.
- Blood is being shed, Foggy.

58
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,190
And you've donated
more than your fair share to the cause.

59
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,020
- I need to stop him.
- You need to get rest. Okay?

60
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,280
And when you wake up,
you need to consider

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,740
putting that thing back
in whatever wacko box it came from.

62
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,410
Better yet...

63
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,170
Let go.

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,670
You first.

65
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,050
I don't wanna do this again.

66
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,130
Then don't.

67
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,510
You know what would've happened
if someone caught us stumbling home?

68
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,060
- You wearing that thing?
- I appreciate it, Foggy.

69
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,060
- You taking care of me.
- You should.

70
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,480
But when the cops
try to take this guy down,

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,900
it's gonna be one hell of a fight,
lives are gonna be lost.

72
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,480
This guy's not gonna go down easy.

73
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,280
I need to help.

74
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,660
You look like shit.

75
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,330
Stay here. Get rest.

76
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,120
We don't need people asking questions
we don't have answers to.

77
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,420
I've covered for you enough as it is.

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,670
And for now, let the NYPD
and the DA do their jobs.

79
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,550
And trust me to do mine!

80
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,720
Okay?

81
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,760
That window bulletproof?

82
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,930
Twenty cops outside that door.
You're safe.

83
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,430
Where the hell are your boys?

84
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,890
On their way.

85
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,940
Place of birth?

86
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,190
Queens.

87
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,570
Relatives? Anyone we should place
into Witness Protection with you?

88
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,030
No. I got no one.

89
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,910
You don't seem rattled.

90
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,370
A guy tries to blow your head off,
you ain't scared?

91
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,210
I'm terrified.

92
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,210
- Sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm.

93
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,340
The paperwork's almost done
and Brett's gonna be in in a minute.

94
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,760
Where's Murdock?

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,590
He took a sick day.

96
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,680
You told us the Irish were attacked
by a whole gang of guys.

97
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,180
I'm pretty sure
the word you used was "army."

98
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,480
You want to tell me
why I'm now hearing

99
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,810
this is all being done by one man?

100
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,610
- Look, I didn't know you guys were...
- Who does he work for?

101
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,250
- I got no idea!
- Well, what do you know?

102
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,780
I know he's a sociopath, that's what.

103
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,490
I mean, yeah, fine...

104
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,070
I heard the rumors, okay,
but I didn't think...

105
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,580
I thought it was ridiculous, okay?

106
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,540
Ten, 20 guys could be
mowed down at a time.

107
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,660
And with precision?
You know, tactically.

108
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,170
Every hit was like
some kind of SEAL Team 6.

109
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,090
Then people started saying
it was one guy doing all that.

110
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,210
One man?
I thought it was a ghost story.

111
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,470
Some...

112
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,510
campfire shit you tell freshies
to make 'em crap their pants.

113
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,600
But now...

114
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,890
You saw.

115
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,520
That guy was the Grim Reaper.

116
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,770
Mr. Grote, I'm Sergeant Mahoney.

117
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,610
Got some clothes here for you.

118
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,440
What? Am I arrested?

119
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,820
Just protective custody
until we can figure out WITSEC.

120
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Why the peel?

121
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,530
Or stay in the gown
with your ass hangin' out,

122
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,570
- I don't care.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,990
We pulled the security footage
from the hospital.

124
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,330
- I got ten men going over it right now.
- Any leads?

125
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,870
I was hoping you had something.

126
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,350
Let's let him change. You two wanna
step outside with me for a sec?

127
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,720
Now, the DA's office
is sending someone over

128
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,650
to talk you through
Witness Protection options.

129
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,270
- Today?
- Yeah, right now.

130
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,110
And listen,
take whatever deal they offer, okay?

131
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,710
You don't wanna mess with this psycho.

132
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,270
So you do have a lead.

133
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,400
I ever tell you what Clemons used to say?

134
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,200
Gotta treat witnesses like mushrooms.

135
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,410
Feed 'em shit, and keep 'em in the dark.

136
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,990
That scum's on a need to know.

137
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,200
So fill us in.
Who's bankrolling this guy?

138
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,410
Who does he work for?

139
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,340
The DA's office says
the shooter's independent.

140
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,500
Vigilante type,
targeting different crime families.

141
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,420
<i>And not in a... a Daredevil way.
In a Death Wish way.</i>

142
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,670
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,640
Daredevil kicks ass, this whole city
cheers like we just won the World Series.

144
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,100
But this guy?

145
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,520
He does it, and the streets get bloody.

146
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,890
Makes everybody stop and think twice
about the whole "hero" proposition.

147
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,770
Well, what do you think?

148
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,110
The whole force is split.

149
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,230
Some cops want him off the street,

150
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
others think he's making our jobs
a whole lot easier.

151
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,700
But if you ask me,
it's only a matter of time

152
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,160
before the wrong person
gets caught in the crossfire.

153
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,120
Yeah, you put it that way,
I guess copycats were inevitable.

154
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,960
No, it's not the first, just the latest.

155
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,460
Yeah, we call them "Devil Worshippers."

156
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,050
Nutjobs inspired by
the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

157
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,550
Shit, most of 'em are just
ineffectual idiots, but this guy...

158
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,550
all my years on the force,
I've never seen anything like him.

159
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,160
Oh.

160
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,670
Shit, it's not an assistant,
it's the actual DA.

161
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,170
That's Reyes?

162
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,800
In all her
defense-attorney-destroying glory.

163
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,210
How do I look?

164
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,920
Uh, semi-professional.

165
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,430
- No, Foggy, I'm kidding. You'll be fine.
- Okay.

166
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,110
Are they the ones that brought in Grote?

167
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,510
Um, Franklin Nelson,
of Nelson and Murdock.

168
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,060
This is my associate, Karen Page.

169
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,980
Officers, I want you to prepare
Mr. Grote for transport.

170
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,320
Excuse me,
but, transport where, exactly?

171
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,440
Once he's in our custody,

172
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,650
I want you to personally
handle all the arrangements.

173
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,900
Just to put it out there,

174
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,780
our client's already given us
a list of his conditions.

175
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,450
Mr. Nelson, have you ever negotiated
a witness protection agreement?

176
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,210
Well... speaking for my firm,

177
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,580
I can attest that
we're all very fast learners.

178
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,750
The District Attorney
appreciates your efforts,

179
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,920
but our office will be
handling the case from here.

180
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,380
Excuse me. Grotto is our client.

181
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,340
And it would be in
Mr. Grote's best interest

182
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,640
for you to recuse yourselves

183
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,140
so he can bring in a legal team
with more expertise.

184
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,730
You mean someone
you can push around.

185
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,940
We had enough expertise
to handle Wilson Fisk.

186
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,690
I'll say this once, Mr. Nelson.

187
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,570
If, God willing,
your firm doesn't collapse

188
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,610
under the weight of the chickens
and the fruit baskets

189
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,700
you've been collecting
from your indigent clientele,

190
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,990
there will come a time
when you need to ask a favor

191
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,700
of the District Attorney's office.

192
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,620
And depending on how
this situation resolves,

193
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,080
that favor will either be forthcoming
or permanently withheld.

194
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,250
Am I making myself clear?

195
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,920
Of course.

196
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,760
Now...

197
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,970
if we're through?

198
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,890
I'm sorry. Just one sec.

199
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,180
About that favor...

200
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,140
you wouldn't happen to have the number
for the U.S. Attorney's office?

201
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,190
Oh, never mind, I got it.

202
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,150
Uh, U.S. Department of Justice...

203
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,820
Office of Enforcement Operations.

204
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,200
What the hell are you doing?

205
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,910
Zealously protecting my client's rights.

206
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,700
Local DA's don't have jurisdiction
over the witness protection program.

207
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,410
That's solely determined by the
U.S. Attorney's office, a.k.a. the Feds,

208
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,290
who are probably
just as douchey as you are,

209
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,330
but at least they can
deliver on their promises...

210
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,340
and their threats.

211
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,210
Since this really isn't
working out between us,

212
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,470
maybe I should just
deal with them directly.

213
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,050
Kudos, by the way.
The cell service in here is awesome.

214
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,930
Hang up.

215
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,140
<i>- Attorney General's office.
- One second.</i>

216
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,310
Yes, hi. Uh...
This is Franklin Nelson.

217
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,810
<i>- Spell it.
- Uh, yes, uh...</i>

218
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,560
- N-E-L...
- Hang up.

219
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,150
What do you want?

220
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,950
As I see it,
the District Attorney's office

221
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,570
would like to receive
credit for any arrests

222
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,180
that arise from Mr. Grote's testimony.

223
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,830
And my client, on the other hand,
could definitely use

224
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,250
the enthusiastic endorsement
of the New York DA

225
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,500
when entering in his witpro agreement.

226
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,420
In either case, he'll be requiring
legal representation,

227
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,010
which will be provided
by the law firm of Nelson and Murdock.

228
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,920
To put it in layman's terms...

229
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,260
cut the shit, lady.
You're dealing with us.

230
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,850
Let's find out if their low-life client
is even worth it.

231
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, Foggy...

232
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,860
- that was amazing.
- That was just round one.

233
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,610
I'll keep it simple.

234
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,360
Give me a deal, put up a camera,

235
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,160
I'll tell you everything
about those Irish pricks.

236
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Names, dates, their favorite titty-bars...

237
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,950
That's not good enough.

238
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,620
That's what he's got.

239
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,630
Most of Mr. Grote's mob friends
are either dead or fleeing the country.

240
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,920
If you want this office's endorsement,

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,380
you'll have to give us someone
who's still breathing.

242
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
What... So how does my client manage that?

243
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,140
We would like Mr. Grote to wear a wire
to meet one of his old associates.

244
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,430
Our files show your organization
has had dealings with one Edgar Brass.

245
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,910
Brass. You're out of your goddamn mind!

246
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,430
Grotto, calm down.

247
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
- We need a second with our client.
- Fine.

248
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,230
Who's Edgar Brass?

249
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,780
Drug-dealing butcher
who's worse by a mile.

250
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,490
They send me after him,
I'm as good as dead.

251
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,820
I get it, I do,

252
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,530
but chances are,
the Feds are gonna ask for the same thing.

253
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,120
Why Grotto?

254
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,960
Because we know your client
has worked with Brass before.

255
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,130
You got an in.

256
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,250
If he could get Brass to talk,

257
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,710
he would be instrumental
in taking down a major drug ring.

258
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,340
If I don't?

259
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,630
Then you're free to walk away.

260
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
But don't expect to get very far.

261
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,190
Oh, God.

262
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,560
What the hell is that?

263
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,020
You could call it "work product."

264
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,610
Morgue reports generated by the shooter
who attacked you in the hospital.

265
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,610
And all of these people were...
were killed by the same man?

266
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,410
He's tracking gangs to their home turf

267
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,450
and taking them out
with military precision.

268
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,830
But it doesn't stop there.

269
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,040
What do you mean, "doesn't stop"?

270
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,750
His targets aren't random,
Mr. Grote.

271
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,250
He knows exactly who he wants to hit.

272
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,750
And if any of his intended marks
are lucky enough to escape...

273
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,880
Say they're off buying a sandwich,
or in bed with the flu...

274
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,840
recuperating under an assumed name

275
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,100
at Metro-General...

276
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,600
Sooner or later,
he gets to them, too.

277
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,150
Jesus Christ.

278
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,820
My office is offering you
a chance to save yourself.

279
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,780
Whether you take it, is up to you.

280
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,280
And your, uh... legal team.

281
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,200
Reyes.

282
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,750
And the police have
no idea who's doing this?

283
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,460
It's an ongoing investigation.

284
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,710
But our intelligence people
are close to completing a profile.

285
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,880
A profile?

286
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,360
- Even got a code name.
- Like what?

287
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,260
- "Killdozer," or "Dumbass With A Gun"?
- Not quite.

288
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,220
They're calling this one...

289
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,760
"the Punisher."

290
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,650
Check out the phone, man.
That's a brand new Ikea.

291
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,400
Idiot.

292
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh, I suppose this is yours too?

293
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,280
What do you care?

294
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,330
A hundred in trade, come on, man.

295
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,210
Go on, get the hell out of here.

296
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Go ahead.

297
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,640
Shit.

298
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,980
Do I know you?

299
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,770
I need an NYPD mobile communications rig.

300
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,400
One that gets
encrypted tactical frequencies.

301
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,030
What do I look like, RadioShack?

302
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,160
Anyway, dealing in this shit is illegal.

303
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,210
Sure you're not a cop?
'Cause that's trouble I don't need.

304
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,670
- Yeah...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,960
I gotta ask, right?

306
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,260
Just hold on.

307
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,350
Yep.

308
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,690
Straight outta
Officer McDipshit's dashboard.

309
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,230
Gets your tactical bands,
surveillance feeds.

310
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,820
Hell, it'll probably pick up
the mayor banging his boyfriend.

311
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,570
It's a grand.

312
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,780
We're talking about
a one-of-a-kind item.

313
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,380
Video tape.

314
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,590
Sure. What the hell.

315
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,010
What about the double-barrel
under the counter?

316
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,800
Hey, man, hold on.
Sure I can't get you anything else?

317
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,550
You know, I got it all, man.

318
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Yeah, bondage...

319
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,140
back-door, grannies,

320
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,350
or maybe you're in the market
for something younger?

321
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,060
She's barely 12.
Guaranteed.

322
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,280
You like that, huh?

323
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,650
For 100 bucks, she's all yours.

324
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,290
That's my man.

325
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,590
What the hell are you doin'?

326
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,930
Hey, man, just take it easy.

327
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,390
I'm just trying to make a buck!

328
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,190
Thank you, Ms. Kwan.

329
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,440
Yeah, and it shouldn't be
too much longer now.

330
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,990
And yes, we very much
appreciate the kimchi.

331
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,610
Okay. Bye.

332
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,200
Anything else we've been ignoring?

333
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,950
Uh, yeah. Um...

334
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,910
There you go.

335
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,080
Thank you.

336
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,250
"Overdue."

337
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,670
"Past due."

338
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,420
"Final notice."

339
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,510
Hey! "First notice." That's a win.

340
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,050
Karen?

341
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,940
What are you working on?

342
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,480
- Um, the morgue reports.
- What?

343
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,860
Uh, you know,
the stuff the DA showed us.

344
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,490
I'm just running searches
on the names in the databases.

345
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,570
Karen...

346
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,490
I could have been
one of these people, Foggy.

347
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,660
- He was after Grotto.
- I know.

348
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,170
But how long can I tell myself
this is just bad luck?

349
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,080
Fisk? And now this guy?

350
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,090
I mean, what if I'm
drawing this stuff my way?

351
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,300
You're not.
You're gonna be fine.

352
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,130
- "Punisher" is just a nickname.
- Yeah, well, what if I deserve it?

353
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,340
What are you talking about?

354
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,140
Nothing. I just...

355
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,060
None of this feels real, I guess.

356
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,850
That asshole opened fire in a hospital.

357
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,360
You're not the one
who deserves to be punished.

358
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,990
And plus, you got away,
which kind of makes you awesome.

359
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,240
I guess.

360
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,830
Coffee?

361
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,040
I'm buying.

362
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,870
In that case, okay.

363
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,260
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

364
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,840
I'm coming, I'm coming.

365
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,100
Hey.

366
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
Hey.

367
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,640
Sorry, you startled me.

368
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,560
I didn't mean to.

369
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,770
- Come in.
- Uh, sure?

370
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,980
Of course.

371
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,150
Okay.

372
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,280
I, uh... I heard what happened.

373
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,570
Yeah, I'm fine.

374
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,530
No, uh, actually, I'm...
I'm barely holding on.

375
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,740
I really don't enjoy
being used for target practice.

376
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,080
Come here.

377
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,540
I'm glad you're okay.

378
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,090
Me, too.

379
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,630
How about you?

380
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,350
Uh, me, yeah, I'm fine.

381
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,930
Hair of the dog that bit you?

382
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,860
It's, uh, it's not what it looks like.

383
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,740
What does it look like?

384
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,030
Sorry.
No, I don't mean to pry.

385
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,200
- I just, I worry about you a little bit...
- No need. No need.

386
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,710
- ...sometimes.
- Appreciate it.

387
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,040
There's no need to worry.

388
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, you know that doesn't help, right?

389
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,050
You denying that there's anything wrong.

390
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,800
- Karen, let's not...
- No, I...

391
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,630
How many times can I hear
that you fell down the stairs,

392
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,430
- or you walked into a door?
- Well, you know, I'm blind.

393
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,260
And you know that I'm not an idiot.

394
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,850
Okay, um...

395
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,860
Let's say this.

396
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,400
When, or if, you ever feel like...

397
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,120
you can tell me
what's really going on with you...

398
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,790
I promise that I'm here.

399
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,160
Is that a deal?

400
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,420
That is a deal.

401
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,840
Good.

402
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,800
Now, what can you tell me about
the meeting with the DA?

403
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,390
Yeah, um, it's...
Where to begin? Um...

404
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,220
- Reyes showed up.
- Personally?

405
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,390
- Uh, yeah.
- Any idea why?

406
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,810
Well, uh, it wasn't to bask us
in the warmth of her personality,

407
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,900
I can tell you that.

408
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,560
Yeah, Reyes wouldn't buy a pack of gum

409
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,490
if it didn't move her
political career forward.

410
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,690
Well, she wants him on a wire.

411
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,990
She's got him set up for a meeting
with some big fish in the mob named Brass.

412
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,160
And are they gonna protect Grotto?

413
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,450
Yeah. But he's scared shitless
over this psycho shooter, Matt,

414
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,080
and I can't say that I blame him.

415
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,870
Reyes even used it for leverage.
She called him "the Punisher."

416
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,130
- What do they know about him?
- That he's very scary,

417
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,470
but I could have told you that.

418
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,800
So whatever they know about him downtown,
they're keeping it to themselves.

419
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,510
All right, well, that's where we start.

420
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,310
We need to put together a file,
a thorough one.

421
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,190
Find out who this guy is,
what makes him tick.

422
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,270
- Great.
- Yeah.

423
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,890
Mm-hmm.

424
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,190
You think, uh...
you think he's crazy?

425
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,230
Uh, the Punisher? No.

426
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,030
I think he was inevitable.

427
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,360
Inevitable? How so?

428
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,370
Maybe... maybe we created him.

429
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,210
All of us.

430
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,210
The moment that we let Daredevil,

431
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,040
or the Devil of Hell's Kitchen,
or whatever it is...

432
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,250
There's... there's no connection.

433
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,710
Well, actually, I think
it's a pretty straight line, Matt.

434
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,630
Daredevil practiced vigilante justice
in our backyard

435
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,340
and we applauded him for it.

436
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,050
I know that I did.

437
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,390
And we never stopped to think
that maybe...

438
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,480
his actions could open the door
for men like this.

439
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,100
Men... men with guns.

440
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,520
Men who think that the law
belongs to them.

441
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,780
There... there's a difference.

442
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,150
- Well, I don't see it. Not anymore.
- Yeah, well...

443
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,620
Daredevil never killed anyone.

444
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,120
Well, not that we know of.

445
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,250
There's something about this city

446
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,210
that makes good people want to
shoot their way out of bad situations.

447
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,000
You think this "Punisher"
could be a good person?

448
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,840
No.

449
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,760
No, I'm just saying...

450
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,220
he could be any one of us.

451
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,350
I'm gonna get back to Foggy.

452
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,320
- You know he hates prepping cases alone.
- Right.

453
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,530
- Uh, if you need anything at all...
- No, I won't.

454
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,860
- ...you just let us know, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

455
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,120
Thank you for coming around.

456
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,700
Wait, Matt, I, um...

457
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,120
We care about you.

458
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,460
You're worth keeping around.

459
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,770
How far away was this guy when he hit you?

460
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,270
Four or five feet. Why?

461
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,980
He could've killed you.

462
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,440
And one inch in either direction,
your face would be spaghetti.

463
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,190
I mean, look at that shot placement.

464
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,860
I got lucky.

465
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,410
Yeah, maybe.

466
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,120
Or maybe it was a warning shot.

467
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,700
He could've finished you off, but didn't.

468
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,750
Talk about getting your bell rung.

469
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,750
Can you fix it or not?

470
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,430
I promised Betsy I wouldn't
do anything illegal anymore.

471
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,430
I'm not a criminal, Melvin.

472
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,180
You don't have a badge, either.

473
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,850
Look, the man who did this has
already killed dozens in Hell's Kitchen.

474
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,190
How much longer before innocent people
start getting caught in his crossfire?

475
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,230
Yeah?

476
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,360
You sure he didn't follow you here?

477
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,110
I would never allow that to happen.

478
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,080
Okay, it's just you'd never allow yourself
to be shot in the head before.

479
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,620
I gave you my word, Melvin.

480
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,120
When I promised to protect
you and Betsy, remember?

481
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,330
I remember.

482
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,130
It's just I can't just fix this.

483
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,500
Why not?

484
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,010
You gotta understand, it's not just
the cracked part that's broken.

485
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,470
The crack makes the whole thing fragile
like a bird egg.

486
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,800
I gotta make you a new one.

487
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,180
Okay, well, how long is that gonna take?

488
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,650
I don't know, a couple days, maybe?

489
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,810
If I don't sleep.

490
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,560
What can you do for me tonight?

491
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,570
I don't know. Reinforce the cracks.
Replace some of the padding.

492
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,700
Yeah, good. Do it.

493
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,530
Okay, but it won't keep you safe.

494
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,950
I thought that's what you wanted me to do.

495
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,910
We keep each other safe, don't we?
Isn't that our deal?

496
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,290
Yeah, just do your best, Melvin. Okay?

497
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,050
Are you sure you're ready to go out again?

498
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,680
Do I look ready?

499
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,310
Hey, boy.

500
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,020
Good boy.

501
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,580
Good boy.

502
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,780
Jimmy and the boys
are unloading the trailer.

503
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,410
We're breaking this down for parts.

504
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,290
Come on.

505
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,490
Hey... No, no, no!

506
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,370
Don't! Don't!

507
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
<i>Reyes. Are we in position? Over.</i>

508
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,720
<i>Eyes on Brass. He's moving.</i>

509
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,430
<i>He's moving northeast
to the warehouse.</i>

510
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,060
<i>- How far out?
- Five minutes.</i>

511
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,810
<i>Sending in Grote in five.</i>

512
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,530
This is the frigging wire
you want me to wear?

513
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,240
Why don't I just carry
a video camera with me

514
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,360
and a guy with a boom mic?

515
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Relax, Grotto, you'll be fine.

516
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,830
Look, either you are
the luckiest man in Hell's Kitchen,

517
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,290
or someone up there thinks
you're worth saving.

518
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,210
- I really hope that's true.
- We're all set on our end.

519
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,000
Well, good for you, lady.

520
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,250
Me? I got some serious
reservations about this shit.

521
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,800
Should I be concerned?

522
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,220
All we need is for Brass to admit
he's dealing drugs again.

523
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,390
Okay, he doesn't have to say where,
he doesn't have to say to who.

524
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,810
Just get him to confirm it. All right?

525
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,140
Don't make it the first question.
Don't even make it the second one.

526
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,680
Get there organically.

527
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,370
You'll be in and out before you know it.

528
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,110
- He's got no reason not to trust you.
- No?

529
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,320
Look at this thing.

530
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,610
It's like an eight-track player
around my neck.

531
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,940
You came to us for a deal, Grotto.

532
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,240
You wanna walk, walk.
We can always find someone else.

533
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,120
After recent events,
we've got plenty of exciting prospects.

534
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,500
Lots of low-lives are looking to
get out of the crime business for good.

535
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,790
- I don't doubt that.
- Good.

536
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,420
You know where we stand then.

537
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,630
Maybe you should do
some counseling, Counselor.

538
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,670
Hopefully before I change my mind.

539
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,340
This is not a deal you walk away from.

540
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,680
Not alive, no.

541
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,050
You get them Brass

542
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,260
and they get you away
from the psychopath hunting you.

543
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,350
It ain't just him.

544
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,140
What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?

545
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,650
What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?

546
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,850
They didn't.

547
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,980
When Fisk went away,
so did a lot of corrupt cops.

548
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,070
No one's palms
are getting greased anymore.

549
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,320
We're getting you out. Clean.

550
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,440
Yeah.

551
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,990
Doesn't feel like getting out.
Feels like getting in.

552
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,660
Deeper than before.

553
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,660
No, you're not.

554
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,370
Grotto, this is your second chance.

555
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,450
Just don't say anything incriminating,
you'll be fine.

556
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,620
- You serious? Is he serious?
- No.

557
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,620
- Is that a concern?
- No, I'm kidding.

558
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,500
You're covered.
That's why we're here.

559
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,500
Just let the other guy
do all the talking...

560
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,090
and you'll walk out of there alive.

561
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,470
Fine.

562
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,470
These are your orders
for witness protection.

563
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,560
Golden ticket.

564
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,430
It's, uh, legally binding until midnight.

565
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,480
Upon which, if not executed, they turn
into the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.

566
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,850
What?

567
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,520
- Nothing.
- Let's go. It's time.

568
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,990
Bet these assholes are
sending me to Florida.

569
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,990
Actually, they are.

570
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,160
Did I tell you I hate Florida?

571
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,780
Only about a thousand times.

572
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,620
Thank you.

573
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,670
You're welcome.

574
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,590
Kiss for good luck, sweetheart?

575
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,930
I'll take it.

576
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,150
Uh, so did you hear anything from Matt?

577
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,650
Um, he said he's feeling a little better.
Uh, something about turning in early.

578
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,400
Oh, that's good.

579
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,240
Yeah. I'm sure he's fine.

580
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,610
It's showtime.
Target's inside the perimeter.

581
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,900
Target?

582
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,240
Only an expression, Nelson.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

583
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,400
Stay with him.

584
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,030
What the hell is he doing?

585
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,040
Uh, from the look of the thing,
I'd say he's trying not to crap his pants.

586
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,750
<i>Yo, Brass!</i>

587
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,550
It's me, Grotto.

588
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,010
Cut the spook act
and say something already!

589
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,430
Shit, shit.

590
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,010
Shit.

591
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,890
You don't wanna deal, fine!

592
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,850
Find someone else
stupid enough to buy H off you!

593
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,400
Good one, asshole.

594
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,950
Let's get this done.

595
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,580
<i>I got places I gotta be tonight.</i>

596
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,670
We lost visual.

597
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,840
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday,
what do you call it? Abort!

598
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,760
- Abort!
- I'm a cop, moron. Shut up.

599
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,590
And sound.
I can't hear him anymore.

600
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
Probably just interference from
the metal in the shipping crate.

601
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,470
Most likely, ma'am.
We'll, uh, try adjusting the gain on it.

602
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,100
Package is delivered.

603
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,860
- What do you mean "package is delivered"?
- If I was you, I'd put that on.

604
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,730
- What? Why? Why?
- Charlie one is now set.

605
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,280
<i>- Over.
- Roger that, Charlie one.</i>

606
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,450
Overwatch positions,
check in by the numbers.

607
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,360
What exactly is an "overwatch position"?

608
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,820
Let the police do their job.

609
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,830
<i>Charlie three is set.</i>

610
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,910
<i>Clear fields of fire
in sectors one and five. Over.</i>

611
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,570
<i>Charlie four is set.
Clear fields of...</i>

612
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,120
"Fields of fire"
doesn't sound like cop talk to me.

613
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,710
That sounds like you're
planning an ambush.

614
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,630
Really? You're using my client
as bait for the Punisher?

615
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,390
Probably the first useful thing
your client's ever done in his life.

616
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,930
Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun suing you.

617
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,680
Whatever it is that you have
planned here for tonight, it ends now.

618
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,350
We're getting Grotto out.

619
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,430
We have a situation taking place
on Tac channel one, ma'am!

620
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,310
<i>Target is inbound.
Repeat, target is inbound.</i>

621
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,070
Take him out!

622
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,500
Hold your fire! Move in!

623
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,220
- Keep your bead!
- I'll go left!

624
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,720
Hands in the air! Now!

625
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,100
Shit! It's not him, it's a diversion.
Target's still out there!

626
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,850
The bastard knew it was a trap.

627
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,180
Shit.

628
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,640
Grotto's getting away.
We have to go get him.

629
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,800
No, you can't go out there.

630
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,300
- Foggy!
- This place is about to become a war zone.

631
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,890
- I don't care.
- I know it sucks,

632
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,850
but the safest place to be
is in this room right now.

633
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,940
What the hell is that?

634
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,400
Status report.
What's going on out there?

635
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,940
<i>Target acquired.</i>

636
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,360
<i>- You know what to do.
- Negative.</i>

637
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,480
<i>We do not, I repeat,
we do not have a clean target.</i>

638
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,570
Shit!

639
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,280
You know what to do.
Take the shot!

640
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,320
<i>- No.
- Ten-four.</i>

641
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,740
Take the shot.
Repeat, take the shot!

642
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,710
<i>We lost him!</i>

643
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Foggy?

644
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,760
Ground floor clear.

645
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,300
They're gone. Repeat, they're gone.
