1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,931
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,764
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,407
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,048
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,445
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,762
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,967
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,929
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,003
Tell me you don't have
a substance abuse problem.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,449
The DA's office
has a generous severance package.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,285
- Wait, let me explain to DA...
- I'm sorry, but you're done.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,643
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,121
- You got what you came for...
- Time's up.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,486
You freaking psychopath!

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,084
No!

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,531
Roy was injected with a serum.
We'll have to keep an eye on him.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,888
Roy, stop it!
You're killing him!

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,170
You're stronger,
you heal faster, but you're not in control.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,606
I can teach you.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,882
- Let me help you.
- When do we start?

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,928
Got your latest customer.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,320
Genius here held up a convenience store
across the street from a police precinct.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,845
Not the smartest plan.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,247
Come on through.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,850
Bum knee. I had it
replaced a few years ago.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,160
Well, I guess we'll have to do this
old-fashioned-like. Arms up.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,768
Got you a new bunkmate.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,124
Play nice.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,724
Ben Turner?

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,604
Tonight. Midnight.
Redwood Drive, Larkspur Avenue.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,405
The hell are you talking about?

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,888
Redwood and Larkspur. Rooftop. Be there.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,913
I don't know if
you've looked around,

34
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:05,314
but we don't exactly have
in and out privileges here.

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,171
My son is with his mother.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,926
I won't get to see him anyway.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,330
This way, he's set.
I do this, he gets the money.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,803
Do what?

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,004
What's going on down there?

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,524
Crap.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,162
- What the hell did you do to him?
- I didn't do anything.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,490
Again.

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
You know, I slapped water
out of a bowl yesterday.

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,799
And I slapped water out
of a bowl the day before.

45
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:22,748
You must be getting
pretty good at it.

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,406
Yeah, well, I can't wait
to get attacked by a dog dish.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,480
It's how an archer builds arm strength.

48
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,384
I'm not sure if you've
been paying attention...

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,248
- but strength isn't my problem.
- No. Controlling it is.

50
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,769
Again.

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,365
And that is how you put a guy
in the hospital last week.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,727
How did you know about that?
It's none of your business.

53
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,248
I made it my business
when you agreed to let me help you.

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,167
I knew someone like you.

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,046
Someone injected with the Mirakuru.

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,647
He was my friend.

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,290
But it warped his mind to the point where I
didn't even recognize him anymore.

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,649
Who was this guy?

59
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,371
How come I've never heard of him
or that Mirakuru?

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,872
Is there anything you
can tell me about him?

61
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,897
Yeah.

62
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,650
I had to put an arrow through his eye.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,284
If I'm reading this right,
then Slade is back at the cave.

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,496
Why would he go back
to where the graves are?

65
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,668
Don't know. We'll find
out when we find him.

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,009
And when we do, you can't tell him.

67
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,844
Tell him what?

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,162
Don't talk to me like I'm other people.

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,925
You've got that look on your face.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,845
The same one that you had
after the first time we kissed.

71
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,129
- Pure guilt.
- It's because I am guilty, Sara.

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,330
- Ivo killed Shado because of me.
- Look, that's not true.

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,177
And even if it was, nothing
good comes from telling

74
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:10,266
Slade that you think
you're responsible...

75
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,369
for the death of the woman he loved.

76
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,326
Love's the most powerful emotion.

77
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,204
And that makes it the most dangerous.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,490
Great.

79
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,404
You still know how to get to the cave?

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,883
Yeah. It's this way.

81
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,930
Thea? What are you doing home?
I thought you were staying at Roy's.

82
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,169
I just needed a little me time.

83
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,247
- What's with the "fancy" fancy?
- Oh, I'm going out to dinner...

84
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,881
with Walter.

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,562
- Like a date?
- Like a dinner.

86
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,286
Truly, I don't know what the evening holds.

87
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,970
Are you all right?

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,089
Yeah, I'm fine.

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,568
Mostly. Uh, it's Roy.

90
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,242
He had some trouble last week...

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,087
and I don't know how to help him.

92
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,289
Want me to stay home?
I can call Walter and we can reschedule...

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,240
Absolutely not. If you and Walter
are gonna patch things up...

94
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,649
No pressure, but you're going.

95
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,927
It may be nothing.

96
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,088
Only one way to find out.

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,726
No, please, Dad, come right in.

98
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,408
Well, I guess you're going for
that lived-in look.

99
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,331
Can't afford a housekeeper without a job.

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,484
Got enough beverage money, I see.

101
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,802
I'm gonna need to crack open
another bottle if we're gonna fight.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,411
I didn't come here to fight.

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,962
Then why are you here?
Because I'm fine, really.

104
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,964
In fact, I have a job interview.

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,726
- At Joanna's new firm.
- That's good.

106
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,686
Good. But the real reason I came here is...

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,128
You realized that you didn't reach
your weekly quota of reminding me...

108
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,970
of how much I'm ruining my life?

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,721
It's because I miss you, Laurel.

110
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,121
For a long time, it was just you and me.

111
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,006
Whatever else was going on,
no matter how bad either of us was doing...

112
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,607
we didn't disappear on each other.

113
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,964
Because you're my family.

114
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,328
And I miss my family.

115
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,001
So how about we have dinner,
you and me, tonight?

116
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,210
I already ate.

117
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,051
Yeah.

118
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,366
How about tomorrow night?

119
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,686
Sure.

120
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,683
Dinner tomorrow.

121
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,886
Thank you.

122
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,361
- How's it going with Roy?
- Not well.

123
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,923
I don't know the kid all too well,
but he seems to be five kinds of angry.

124
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,044
You might be underestimating.

125
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,208
Roy was mad at the world
before he was injected with Mirakuru.

126
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,365
- You say you've seen this before?
- Slade Wilson. He was my friend.

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,444
Troubling use of past tense there.

128
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,448
I thought I could help him control it.

129
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,447
I was wrong. But I know more now, and I'm
not gonna make the same mistake with Roy.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,206
- What's that?
- Iron Heights.

131
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,040
Due to their low security post-quake,
I thought it be a good idea...

132
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,209
to keep an eye on their
internal communication for a while.

133
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,727
You hacked into a prison system network?

134
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,447
- Is that judgment I'm hearing?
- Pride.

135
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,564
Iron Heights just put out a BOLO
for Ben Turner, a.k.a. Bronze Tiger...

136
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,606
which, BTW, is a terrible nickname,
because tigers are not bronze.

137
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,160
- Turner escaped?
- Killed 10 guards on his way out.

138
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,369
Think that would've
made the news.

139
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,945
Iron Heights is better at keeping secrets
than they are at keeping prisoners.

140
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,963
- Any idea where he's headed?
- No.

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,645
Get one.

142
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,441
Tell your men to take a walk.

143
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,727
- Leave us.
- They can leave their weapons too.

144
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,441
Thank you for the early release.

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,770
Thought about taking off, but I'm curious.

146
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,962
Who would break a stranger out of prison?

147
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,600
Someone who wishes to hire you for a job.

148
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,964
I need you to help my men
retrieve a certain item.

149
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,643
This is the item. You know it, yes?

150
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,325
Yes, I do.

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,284
Do you know what you're messing with here?

152
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,883
Won't be cheap.

153
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,125
This is not a problem.

154
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,760
You do know that thing
could kill hundreds of people.

155
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,404
No, Mr. Turner, it will kill thousands.

156
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,324
Now you.

157
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,563
Go slowly.

158
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,807
Stop. This is not about
learning to throw a punch.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,846
This is about learning
to control your strength.

160
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,442
First water slapping, now this.

161
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,082
When are you gonna run out of ways
to make me look stupid?

162
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,808
All I'm learning
is new ways to get pissed off.

163
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,690
And in case you haven't noticed,
I'm already pretty good at that.

164
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,161
There's nothing wrong with anger, Roy.
Anger is energy.

165
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,489
But you need to learn
to channel it in a positive way.

166
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,884
Like putting the hurt
on guys going after the city.

167
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,320
Let me try hitting something
that will actually hit back.

168
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,603
- Too soon.
- Get me out there with you.

169
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,490
One night.

170
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,610
All this, it'd be a lot easier to take.

171
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,247
Moira.

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,045
Ahh, I didn't realize we'd have company.

173
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,006
This is Mark Francis.
Mark's CFO at Kardak Holdings.

174
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,240
We've been putting in some hours for the
party's Election Steering Committee.

175
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,328
- Oh.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

176
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,407
Those are words I'm not accustomed
to hearing these days.

177
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,250
You were a lioness doing what she
had to do to protect her cubs.

178
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,526
I'm not the only person
in Starling who sees it that way.

179
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,848
- That's a comfort.
- It's the truth.

180
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,565
Please.

181
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,081
Well, it's unlike you to show
such interest in politics, Walter.

182
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,211
It's part of my new position
at the Starling National Bank.

183
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,888
My board of directors is very concerned
about the trajectory of the city.

184
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,283
- You mean Sebastian Blood?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,968
We believe that his policies will bankrupt
Starling within the next eight months.

186
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,000
Not that the average voter cares,
they're all caught up in his charisma.

187
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,686
And he's not running against
a viable opponent.

188
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,924
Blood's trounced every potential candidate
we've focus-tested.

189
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,600
But we believe
that he's vulnerable on regulation.

190
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,044
Well, even if he is, it hardly matters.

191
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,761
Banking regulations are an SEC issue.

192
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,043
Starling City needs to use the means
at a city's disposal.

193
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,371
Walter said you were smart.

194
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,051
But you didn't invite me to dinner
to hear my opinions.

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,687
You want to hear my positions.

196
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,768
You want me
to run against Sebastian Blood.

197
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,565
Dad, I'm starving. Where are we going?

198
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,166
It's just a little hole
in the wall right here.

199
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,805
- Laurel, wait.
- Don't touch me.

200
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,278
I can't believe you would
do something like this.

201
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,823
Well, you wouldn't
have come otherwise.

202
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,689
- Well, you got that right.
- Laurel, you need help.

203
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,644
Not from them.

204
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,765
There's not one person in that room
who knows what I have been through.

205
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,883
Yeah, you're right.
Some of them have been through worse.

206
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,870
But for better or worse,
everyone in that room

207
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:40,469
needs to be there and
you need to be there.

208
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,291
You think you're the only person
that's ever lost someone?

209
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,327
Who ever got fired, who ever
got their lives into a mess?

210
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:48,510
You think again, kiddo,
because you're not.

211
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,409
Now, look, we're here now.
So why don't you just stay for a bit?

212
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,042
You don't have to share or talk,
you just listen.

213
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,641
I thought I made myself clear.

214
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,640
I'm hungry.

215
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,125
And now I think I'll eat alone.

216
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,085
Go ahead.

217
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,521
S.C.P.D.'s network
just lit up with a fresh homicide.

218
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,371
Multiple stab wounds, like claw marks.

219
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,925
The victim was an architect.

220
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,845
Turner ransacked his place,
took blueprints of his designs.

221
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,964
One of the aforementioned designs,
Malcolm Merlyn's house.

222
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,811
I don't know much about architecture,
but this can't be good.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,048
What would Turner want
with Merlyn's house?

224
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,640
I'm not sure yet. All of Malcolm's holdings,
including the house, are in receivership.

225
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,683
Who's that you're talking to?

226
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,050
Oh, wait, let me guess.
You can't tell me that either.

227
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,606
A guy that I put in prison got out
and I have an idea where he's headed.

228
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,091
You have one of your hoodies?

229
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,722
Do you seriously have to ask?

230
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,124
Whatever happens...

231
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,529
whoever we run into,
do not engage.

232
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,089
And don't touch anything.

233
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,049
This is his kid, right?

234
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,964
The guy who died?

235
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,765
Yes.

236
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,646
You know your way around this place.
You've been here before?

237
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,324
What was that?

238
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,724
It came from underground.

239
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,327
Merlyn has a large garage.
Let's go.

240
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,565
What the hell is that?

241
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,000
Looks like a prototype.

242
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,690
Of what?

243
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,766
A machine that killed 503 people.

244
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,530
Merlyn's earthquake device.

245
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,209
Okay, simple snatch and grab.

246
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,370
Don't know why Mr. Armitage
thought we needed you.

247
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,607
For that.

248
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,086
Step away from the device.

249
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,806
You don't know what it is
you're dealing with.

250
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,724
Big machine, makes earthquakes?

251
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,009
Do you have any idea what happens
if the wrong people have it?

252
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,970
Yeah, I get paid.

253
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,089
Close it up.

254
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,925
That thing killed eight of my friends.

255
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,080
You son of a bitch!

256
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,209
Hey. That's enough.

257
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,923
- Uh-oh. You got angry face.
- What happened?

258
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,049
- Roy Harper.
- You took him out in the field?

259
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,687
He wasn't listening to me, Diggle. I'm
trying to reach him, but he lost control.

260
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,681
Then he nearly killed somebody,
which I obviously couldn't let happen.

261
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,564
- And in the process...
- Turner got away.

262
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,260
What was he there to steal,
Merlyn's art collection?

263
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,909
Something much more dangerous.

264
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,689
It's a prototype earthquake machine.

265
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,491
Holy God.

266
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,589
Why would Turner want
to destroy the city?

267
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,523
He doesn't. He's a mercenary
selling his services to the highest bidder.

268
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,802
This watch belonged to one of
the guys Turner was working with.

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,490
- Fingerprints.
- Turner's a loner.

270
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,728
Which means that guy works for his client.

271
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,764
Fingerprints equals name,
equals known associates. I'm on it.

272
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,964
It was the look in Roy's eyes.

273
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,567
It was Slade all over again.

274
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,809
- Oliver, what happened with Slade?
- Me.

275
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,611
Someone killed Shado, Slade loved Shado.
And it was my fault.

276
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,969
I wanted to tell him because
it would've been better coming from me.

277
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,685
But I didn't.

278
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,689
And he found out another way.

279
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,489
If I had just told him the truth,
I could've gotten through to him.

280
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,504
And that's why it's so important
for you to get through to Roy.

281
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,073
I lived a five-year nightmare.

282
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,371
But if I learned something
that could help me reach Roy now...

283
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,648
it'd all be worth it.

284
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,047
He's not here.

285
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,524
Where else could he be?
We already checked the plane.

286
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,449
I don't know.

287
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,926
Do you remember seeing these before?

288
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,525
- I didn't really look around.
- They look familiar.

289
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,964
- I mean, this could be Lian Yu.
- No, I mean the calculations.

290
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,400
I've seen those before.

291
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,775
Maybe the first time
you were in the cave.

292
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,912
I don't think so.

293
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,963
- Fyers' launcher.
- What?

294
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,851
Soldiers on the island last year
and they had a missile launcher.

295
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,489
I saw one of these on the display.
They're firing calculations.

296
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,521
He's gonna blow it up.

297
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,367
Blow what up?

298
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,361
The freighter.

299
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,203
Thank God you're here.
I need your help...

300
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,110
I have to talk to you.
It's important.

301
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,011
Okay. You look stressed out.
Is everything okay?

302
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,565
You have to leave town.

303
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,604
Grab your mother and your brother,
if you can, and leave.

304
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,770
- It's just for a few days.
- A reason would be nice.

305
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,849
- I need you to trust me, Thea.
- I do.

306
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,930
I just can't up and leave
with my family without a reason.

307
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,201
You have to.

308
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,008
Roy, you're not making any sense right now.

309
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,120
- Now you just tell me what's going on.
- Why aren't you listening to me?

310
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,841
- Now, I need you to listen to me.
- Roy, you're hurting me.

311
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,569
- I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
- I know...

312
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,689
Well, your work environment
has definitely improved since CNRI.

313
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,929
This place is bigger than my apartment.

314
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,282
There is a limit to the glamour,
unfortunately.

315
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,608
I spend my days in...

316
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,565
document production
and answering interrogatories.

317
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,402
It doesn't feel like practicing law
so much as pushing papers.

318
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,792
If I didn't know any
better, I'd think that

319
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,107
you were trying to talk
me out of a job here.

320
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,725
I guess I do know better.

321
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,967
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,560
What's going on?

323
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,120
One of the partners serves on the
Bar Association's Disciplinary Committee and...

324
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,480
well, when I sent your resume,
he did some checking.

325
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,041
That was a complete misunderstanding.

326
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,971
I mean, sure, yeah,
I had some problems, but I'm fine now.

327
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,401
The Bar is going to open
disciplinary proceedings.

328
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,365
What for?

329
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,881
Conduct affecting your fitness to practice.

330
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,165
- Heh. That's ridiculous.
- I know.

331
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,205
While this is out there...

332
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,849
the firm can't hire you.

333
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,530
Thanks.

334
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,931
Thanks for letting me know. I have to go.

335
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,451
Laurel. Laurel.

336
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,122
We can fight this. Okay?
I'll help you, it...

337
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,288
I need some time to...

338
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,843
process. I'll call you.

339
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,126
- Can I fix you a drink?
- Whatever you're having.

340
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,762
It was good to see you
the other night, Moira.

341
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,929
It was lovely.

342
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,927
It's been a while since I've had
such a good laugh.

343
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,845
It was no joke, Moira.

344
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,889
Mark was telling the truth.

345
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,090
A significant number of people
in Starling City feel that...

346
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,001
your actions with Malcolm Merlyn
were justified to protect your family.

347
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,568
- 43.6 percent, in fact.
- You polled people about me?

348
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,849
Prudent course of action when vetting
a potential candidate, yes.

349
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,489
Six hundred thousand people in Starling
City. I'd think you could find someone...

350
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,724
not responsible for destroying it
with an earthquake machine.

351
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,321
Not with your name recognition.

352
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,924
We need a game-change candidate, Moira.

353
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,600
And there's no one in Starling
with a higher profile than you.

354
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,202
Charles Manson is rather well-known,
and no one is going to vote for him.

355
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,807
True. Equally true,
voters like redemption stories.

356
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,765
Bill Clinton. Eliot Spitzer.

357
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,440
- Martha Stewart.
- I don't believe she ran for office.

358
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,205
If she had, she would have won.

359
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,925
Would have won what?

360
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,770
Thea.

361
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,486
What's going on?

362
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,524
I'm just convincing your mother
to run for mayor.

363
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,524
- Of what?
- You see?

364
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,927
- Sweetheart, are you all right?
- You really need to stop asking that.

365
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,401
Are you serious?

366
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,409
It's hard to believe, I know.

367
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,489
No. No, it's not.

368
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,930
Look, this is actually the first election
I can vote in...

369
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,363
and as a newly-minted voter...

370
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,369
I don't think it sounds that crazy.

371
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,811
From out of the mouths of babes.

372
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,326
You're late.

373
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,526
I tried to get my girlfriend to leave town.

374
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,808
But she won't.

375
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,529
You cannot bring her into this.

376
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,049
But how am I supposed to lie to her
and protect her at the same time?

377
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,290
How do you do it?

378
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,761
How do you keep secrets
from people in your life?

379
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,969
By remembering it's the only way
to keep them safe.

380
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,601
No, keeping them safe
is what keeps them safe.

381
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,131
Telling people the truth.

382
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,290
But you? You won't tell me anything.
Not about the Mirakuru.

383
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,689
And this other guy. You've got me
slapping water and hitting dummies instead.

384
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,571
Roy, you're spiraling,
and you need to calm down.

385
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,047
No. I need to save Thea.

386
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,529
That thing is out in the open
because of you.

387
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,888
I think you've done enough.

388
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,127
Let go of me.

389
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,329
- Roy.
- I said, let go of me.

390
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,648
Get control.

391
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,640
If not for me or yourself,
then do it for Thea.

392
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,844
What the hell do you know about Thea?
Don't you talk about her.

393
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,610
Are you done?

394
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,368
No. I'm not done.

395
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,210
I'm gonna stop this thing.

396
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,164
And if you wanna stop me, try.

397
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,161
Try putting another arrow in me. Go ahead.

398
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,170
Because I heal fast now,
but you get in my way...

399
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,552
and I'll give you a
good look at that anger

400
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,867
you're so worried about
me losing control of.

401
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,000
You both scoffed when I said we should
invest in an x-ray machine for down here.

402
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,365
What do you wanna do about Roy?

403
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,170
Where are we with the fingerprint?

404
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,371
Struck out on domestic agencies.
But I'm checking Interpol...

405
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,843
PRC Public Security,
and MVD databases now.

406
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,811
Oliver, I know you've taken Roy on,
and why.

407
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,886
But Roy, Slade,
a lot of guys I've served with...

408
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,128
some people are just broken, man.

409
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,211
- And nobody can put them back together.
- I refuse to believe that.

410
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,169
I am not letting what happened to Slade
happen to Roy.

411
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,687
I'm not.

412
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
Yep.

413
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,401
Are you near the club?

414
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,209
I'm pretty close. Why?

415
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,201
Laurel's here.

416
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,085
She doesn't look good.

417
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,251
Hey. Laurel's upstairs.

418
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,167
Mm. Excuse me.
Can I get something with olives?

419
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,401
I don't care what it is
as long as there are a lot of olives.

420
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,250
How about coffee?

421
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,522
Coffee and olives?

422
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,767
Bad combination.

423
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,049
What are you doing?

424
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,927
This is where it's happening, right?
The big club?

425
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,010
- Here you go. Martini, triple olives.
- Thanks.

426
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,680
Laurel, go home.

427
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,446
Thea Queen telling me...

428
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,125
enough is enough.

429
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,090
Now, that is rich.

430
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,644
Fine.

431
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,725
Bar me from your bar.

432
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,810
That's today's theme, right? Disbarment?

433
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,641
- Laurel, are you being disbarred?
- Yeah, looks like my law career's over.

434
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,127
But you know what?

435
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,001
Maybe Thea here can hire me as a waitress.

436
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,686
Or, Ollie, I could come be your secretary.

437
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,042
But that would mean
you would have to fire her.

438
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,250
Hi, Laurel. How are you?

439
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,960
Did you need to borrow my car?

440
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,488
Did your limo break down?

441
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,326
- Get her a cab, please.
- Yeah.

442
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,847
Fingerprint was in Interpol's database.
Guy worked for Milo Armitage.

443
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,322
- He's a black market arms merchant.
- He's trying to sell the device.

444
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,370
I need you to search for any indication
Armitage is in Starling.

445
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,928
I already did. His ship filed a loading
manifest at the Starling City docks.

446
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,570
I'll get you the slip number.

447
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,885
Hi, it's Oliver.

448
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,130
I just ran into Laurel
and something's wrong.

449
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,361
She needs you.

450
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,725
Slade?

451
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,485
Oliver.

452
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,126
Slade?

453
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,888
- Keep back!
- We know you're targeting the boat.

454
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,568
I'm gonna send that son of a bitch
to the bottom of the ocean.

455
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,722
You're gonna destroy our
only way off the island.

456
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,527
As long as Ivo is dead, that's fine.

457
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,047
I can't let you do it.

458
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,327
Get back!
Or so help me, I will put you down.

459
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,071
Mom, what are you doing here?

460
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:34,067
I came by to get your
advice on something.

461
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,531
Step into my office.

462
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,569
This is about the campaign, right?

463
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,081
It's really awesome
you're thinking of doing this.

464
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,523
You said something that stayed with me.

465
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,884
The idea that there could be
voters out there...

466
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,963
that wouldn't dismiss me out of hand.

467
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,050
Well, you did run
a multi-billion dollar company.

468
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,010
Yes, and an undertaking
that destroyed the city.

469
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,565
People will get over that.

470
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,210
What makes you so certain?

471
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,482
Because I did.

472
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,041
Can I make a suggestion?

473
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,801
Instead of punishing yourself,
because you think you destroyed the city...

474
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,768
how about you start by saving it?

475
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,891
Ten million dollars, I believe,
was the negotiated amount.

476
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,125
Congratulations,
you're now in a new tax bracket.

477
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,610
Just out of curiosity,
you pay me 10 million...

478
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,001
- and you get...?
- Three times that.

479
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,601
You already have a buyer?

480
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,767
I recommend that you stay clear
of Markovia for a few months.

481
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,446
I believe our business is now concluded.

482
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,564
Not yet.

483
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,403
Looks like your partner abandoned you.

484
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,446
He's not my partner.

485
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,808
He's someone I hired to do the job.

486
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,644
And it turns out it was money well-spent.

487
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,485
Just too dumb to stay down.

488
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,722
Don't do it. You'll kill everyone here.

489
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,130
If I don't deliver this device
to my buyer in Markovia, I'm dead anyway.

490
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,970
No!

491
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,688
Roy, I need your help.

492
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,723
- Roy, stop. Roy!
- Son of a bitch!

493
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,524
Roy, I need you to stop.

494
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,201
The earthquake device is in there.

495
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,283
The steel is military-grade. It's built
to withstand a bomb, but not you.

496
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,568
Think about Thea.

497
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,483
Because she could die without your help.

498
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,409
I know you love her.

499
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,603
Because I've seen it.

500
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,082
Save my sister.

501
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,124
Control.

502
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,847
Focus on Thea.

503
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,680
She needs you right now.

504
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,168
Or she is dead. Everyone is dead.

505
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,041
- You're...?
- Yeah.

506
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,287
Yeah.

507
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,206
Last year, you saved my life.

508
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,370
And I don't mean from the guy
who kidnapped me. I mean...

509
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,846
you saved me.

510
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,768
You gave me purpose.

511
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,005
We're just getting started.

512
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,765
So the secret society gets a new member.

513
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,569
Where is he now?

514
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,371
Home.

515
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,289
He's, uh...

516
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,648
processing.

517
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,885
When I found out who you really were,
I processed my way...

518
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,606
through a pint of mint chip.

519
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,441
I stress eat.

520
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,246
Speaking of stress...

521
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,727
I'm not trying to Monday morning
quarterback here, it's Wednesday.

522
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,191
Didn't this all start because
you were worried that

523
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,268
Roy's marble collection
was on the short side?

524
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,767
She has a point, Oliver.

525
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,162
Roy's a loose cannon.
Now he knows your secret.

526
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,930
You're right...

527
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,809
and I wasn't thinking
about the consequences.

528
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,090
I only knew that...

529
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,931
I needed his strength.

530
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,003
His power.

531
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,363
On the island, Sara told me that love
is the most powerful emotion.

532
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,731
Well, the Arrow...

533
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,641
couldn't get Roy to think about Thea.

534
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,644
But I could.

535
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,047
I said, get back.

536
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,366
Think about Shado.

537
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,811
I am thinking about her.

538
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,567
There's something I have to tell you
about Shado.

539
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,522
It's something you deserve to know.

540
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,690
She loved you, Slade.

541
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,566
Maybe not the way that you wanted her to...

542
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,131
but she loved you.

543
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,204
She wanted you to make it home.

544
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,846
She wanted you to see Joe again.

545
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,608
Don't you wanna hug your son?

546
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,970
I know you're angry.

547
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,204
And I know you want revenge.

548
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,087
But if you destroy Ivo's freighter...

549
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,246
then Shado will have died for nothing.

550
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,404
What is happening to me?

551
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,530
I don't know.

552
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,404
But I am not going to let you
go through it on your own.

553
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,690
The man who killed Shado
is still out there.

554
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,527
And whether that freighter
is on the bottom of the ocean or not...

555
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,371
we're still stuck on this island.

556
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,170
Not for long.

557
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,010
Because we're gonna take the freighter.

558
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,810
I was glad to receive your e-mail.

559
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,809
Does it portend what I'm hoping?

560
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,650
I'm going to run.

561
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,248
What changed your mind?

562
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,041
- Thea.
- Mm.

563
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,641
She reminded me that I still owe this city.

564
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,523
And I want to be remembered as something
more than Malcolm Merlyn's pawn.

565
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,001
As you should.

566
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,804
But you know there was another reason
for my reticence.

567
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,887
You're afraid that people will learn
that Robert wasn't her biological father.

568
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,122
I managed to get through
a criminal trial...

569
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,291
without the truth coming out, but political
campaigns tend to be a bit more adept...

570
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,721
at extracting skeletons from closets.

571
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,167
But no one else knows?

572
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,568
Someone does.

573
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,564
My OB, Dr. Gill.

574
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,488
There were complications
when Thea was born.

575
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,520
I had to tell him that Robert
wasn't her father.

576
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,366
So if we're going to move forward...

577
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,083
we need to make certain
that he won't be a problem for us.

578
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,087
Mr. Turner.

579
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,566
I didn't know this place
allowed conjugal visits.

580
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,490
My name is Amanda Waller.

581
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,087
You say that like it's supposed
to mean something.

582
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,528
To the contrary.
My identity is highly classified.

583
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,002
Then why are you
introducing yourself to me?

584
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,487
I have an offer for you.

585
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,769
A way to work off your sentence.

586
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,521
As it turns out,
I have need of someone with your...

587
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,565
singular qualifications.

588
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,567
For what?

589
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,649
For a unit I'm putting together.

590
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,488
What type of unit?

591
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,968
Actually...

592
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,567
it's more of a squad.

593
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,090
Is this the part where you kill me
because I know your secret?

594
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,487
You actually think that I'd kill
my sister's boyfriend?

595
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,325
Well, you did shoot me in the leg.

596
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,727
Forgiven, by the way.

597
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,405
Thea.

598
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,727
She can never know.

599
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,366
I get the feeling that if I did tell her,
that would be when you kill me.

600
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,646
Trust that instinct.

601
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,891
Okay. Wait, how many people know what...?

602
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,161
Who you are?

603
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,846
Too many.

604
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,686
But these are the only two that matter.

605
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,564
John Diggle and Felicity Smoak.

606
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,608
Does this group have a name?

607
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,411
- Like Team Arrow or...?
- We don't call ourselves that.

608
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,371
- I do. Occasionally.
- Stop.

609
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,205
Whatever.

610
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,771
Welcome aboard.

611
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,129
Sara?
