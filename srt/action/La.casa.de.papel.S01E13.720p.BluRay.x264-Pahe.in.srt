1
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:07,321
Inspector, we have the estate.

2
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:10,481
- The person helping them from the
outside has been here

3
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:12,001
less than 30 hours ago.

4
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:13,161
Call Alberto.

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,801
- Whatever they really wanted to erase,
they'll have burned it inside.

6
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:19,641
Look, I was just going to Madrid, I
was going to catch the bus.

7
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:21,081
Get out of the car.

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,561
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,241
Aah! Aah!

10
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:29,441
You're under arrest for assault on authority.

11
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,721
I'm calling from the police station,
I'm under arrest.

12
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,761
I don't know how he got these wounds,
I swear I didn't touch him.

13
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,081
- Have the handcuffs removed.

14
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:37,201
What are you gonna do to me?

15
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,321
On your feet!

16
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,921
Who's the Profesor?
All right, take her away.

17
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,121
Sergio! The Profesor's name
is Sergio Marquina.

18
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,041
We're going to request unconditional
incommunicated prison.

19
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,281
Let's go. Let's go.

20
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,281
I ditch this from the cider in a few days

21
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,081
and we're going to a Caribbean

22
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,601
Look at her, she's very pretty.
And elegant.

23
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:07,481
That woman is from another league, son.
- I heard!

24
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,441
That I'm a piece of shit and that I
have to dream like a piece of shit.

25
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,241
You have a syndrome.
What syndrome?

26
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,801
Stockholm. You go your way,
I go mine and forward.

27
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,881
Sub-inspector Rubio is coming
out of the coma,

28
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,721
He is the only person who knows who I am.

29
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,001
You're gonna have to go and see
if it's a trap.

30
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:23,401
And if it isn't, finish him off.

31
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,881
- Let's get that motherfucker
a fucking red carpet

32
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,041
to the foot of Ángel's bed,
where Lobo will wait for him.

33
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:30,401
- It's very difficult for him to escape.

34
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:40,841
It's the office where they keep the fake guns.

35
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,641
And who's going to take his gun?
Mónica will have to do it

36
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,561
when Denver's going to cure her.

37
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:47,761
Where the fuck are you going?

38
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,681
You've got a toy gun and I've
got a bad motherfucker.

39
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:54,001
I can't stand it.
Why don't we check it out?

40
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:55,961
Turn around.

41
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,921
Come on, quick.
Mónica, open the door!

42
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:01,721
I'm gonna count to five and then
I'm gonna shoot him.

43
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,161
Mónica, don't open the door!

44
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:09,681
Raquel, sooner or later,
this will all be over.

45
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:14,841
And then you and I will meet at the beach.

46
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:20,161
But you have to pick a place.

47
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,961
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
It's just that I haven't had time.

48
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,641
Let's see.

49
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,401
What do you say we pick it out
between the two of us?

50
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:30,761
I'm fine with that.

51
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,361
Pick one.
What a responsibility.

52
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,561
Let's see, ah...

53
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,401
Palawan.
Palawan.

54
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,241
Let me see.

55
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,521
That's wonderful.
And where is this?

56
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:52,961
Palawan, yes. It is an island
of the Philippines.

57
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:58,521
It's southwest of the archipelago,
it's a little above

58
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:03,601
the island of Borneo.
It has 849 000 inhabitants,

59
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,401
more or less, and the capital
is Puerto Princesa.

60
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:13,041
Ángel must have gotten very close
to get the evidence.

61
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,361
It's possible they were even face-to-face.

62
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,721
- Have you looked into it? Because I do.
Have you done your damn job?

63
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:24,601
The best fine sandy beaches in the tropics.

64
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,321
You don't like the Philippines.

65
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:39,321
Yes, I do.

66
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,281
Do you mind if I go to the bathroom
for a minute?

67
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,041
Oh, sure.

68
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:30,041
Suárez, one question.

69
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,161
What colour was the wig of the
clown who spoke

70
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:34,561
with the kid from the hospital?

71
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,521
Orange?

72
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:44,521
You sure about that?

73
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,521
"For your life to fall apart in pieces

74
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,161
it doesn't matter if you're in a bathroom..."

75
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,361
Three, two, one...

76
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,561
"... in a robbery

77
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,241
or at the entrance to a penal institution.

78
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,721
You see, that afternoon we were
going to be synchronized

79
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,361
the misfortunes of three women.

80
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:37,481
Raquel suddenly realized that
she had fallen in love

81
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,121
With the Spain's biggest robber."

82
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,801
She's one of them.

83
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,481
She's with them, you've all seen her!

84
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:46,601
She's with them!

85
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:49,641
"Mónica Gaztambide realized that
she had just become

86
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:53,641
an accomplice to the muggers,
that there'd be no turning back.

87
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,001
And I walked according to the instructions

88
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:01,961
that the Profesor had given us in Toledo,

89
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:04,521
but without any certainty.

90
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,121
Like anesthetized,

91
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,681
like a bottle someone threw into the sea.

92
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,561
With no idea if they were going to pick it up.

93
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:14,801
on the other side."

94
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,961
If you're caught, within 24 hours
of being arrested

95
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:21,801
you say you want to make a pact,
you want to declare,

96
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,641
but before a judge.
And they will have no choice

97
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,881
to take you to the National High Court.

98
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:30,041
And it's possible that in that transfer

99
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:33,641
I can do something for you.

100
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,401
"Well, there I was on my way
to the courthouse,

101
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,161
in the hope that my guardian angel

102
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,881
knew the itinerary that
van was going to follow

103
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,321
and save my life for the second time.

104
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:01,321
It was hard to hope for a van,

105
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:04,401
imprisoned and handcuffed,

106
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:08,481
but it would have been worse
to know in that moment,

107
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:12,321
20 km from there, my guardian angel

108
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,401
had just been discovered."

109
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:52,681
Raquel?
- Hello, Alberto.

110
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,881
Have you already analyzed the
evidence you found

111
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,121
in Toledo's chimney?

112
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,081
- Yes, yes, but nothing conclusive.

113
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,521
- What do you mean nothing conclusive?

114
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,481
- Because they were the remains
of a sports paper

115
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,481
from a couple of days ago,
so I don't know

116
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:11,841
if the evidence is contaminated or
is that the guy with the anchovies

117
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,161
reads the diary on Sundays.

118
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:15,161
- Ok.

119
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:19,641
Hey, how exactly was
the fight with Salva?

120
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,521
- Fuck, Raquel, I told you
it wasn't a fight.

121
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:26,561
The guy grabbed me by the neck,
made me a ninja movement

122
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:28,521
and I lost consciousness.
I didn't touch him.

123
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,961
He's a fucking ninja with glasses.

124
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,441
Why do you ask me that?
- For nothing.

125
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,241
And... Are you saying that he provoked you?
- Yes.

126
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:46,481
He told me he shared my intelligence
with my dick and fists,

127
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:47,681
among other beauties.

128
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:52,081
I wanted a fight, but for what?
- I don't know.

129
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,241
Good-bye.

130
00:09:58,601 --> 00:09:59,721
Alberto

131
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:28,561
No one touches those trays,
they're sealed

132
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:31,201
until further notice.
I want you to take out all the fingerprints

133
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,081
and check them with the spoon

134
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,401
of sub-inspector Rubio.

135
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:36,361
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

136
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:44,041
And then you go to my car and
you get the fingerprints

137
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:45,881
of the copilot's inner handle.

138
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,641
- But...
- Do it.

139
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,481
And remember, we're looking
for a middle-aged male

140
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:03,761
with a beard and glasses.

141
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,121
Hey, hey, hey!

142
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,321
See who that man is and
what he's doing here.

143
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,601
"It was him, of course it was him."

144
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:19,041
Sorry, you won't have a phone
charger out there.

145
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,161
- No, I'm not.

146
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:22,601
Do you want to use mine?

147
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,841
"It had been him from the beginning.

148
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:32,081
Always kind, always with a smile,

149
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,081
always in the right place.

150
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:39,521
The only civilian who had set
foot in the tent."

151
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,441
You see, I think there's something
wrong with your daughter.

152
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:48,001
"The stranger who had managed to get through

153
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,481
one by one all her defenses.

154
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,681
And not just as a cop."

155
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:11,441
Salva.

156
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:15,361
I don't have such a wonderful gift

157
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:19,681
like these postcards,
but I'm going to improvise a surprise.

158
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,321
In the ladies' room.

159
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,641
First you go and then I go.

160
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,481
Raquel.

161
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,321
That we're on children's schedule

162
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:41,801
and in this bar they know both of us.
Salva.

163
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:48,521
It's the first time I'm going
without a parachute

164
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,441
and throw myself in the pool.

165
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,521
Don't tell me there's no water.

166
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,801
Yes, it is.

167
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:07,521
Yes, it is.

168
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:14,201
Then go and wait for me there.

169
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,681
Hands against the wall.

170
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:53,961
Raquel, I don't know...
Hands against the wall.

171
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,921
Oh, what are you doing?
Do you carry a gun?

172
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:02,601
How can I carry a gun, Raquel?
Turn around.

173
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,441
Put it on.

174
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,081
Raquel, is this...?
Put it on, put it on!

175
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,601
You're being arrested for collaboration
in the hostage assault

176
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,761
to the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda

177
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:38,961
"You see."

178
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,961
You have the right to remain silent.

179
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,081
"Finally, the third time was the charm."

180
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,601
Not to testify against you and
to be brought before a judge.

181
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,121
"And this time she had something much bigger

182
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,401
than a suspicion,

183
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,481
he had a grudge, he had anger.

184
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,161
She was poisoned.

185
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:16,041
Helsinki felt something similar,
but not by deception,

186
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,401
but for lack of sleep,

187
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,601
had slept four hours in the last
five days.

188
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,921
Do you know what happens to a
person when they stop sleeping?

189
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:29,281
That their neural connections
merge like a short circuit,

190
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:32,601
stops secreting dopamine,
stops metabolizing glucose

191
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,001
and the only information left
in the brain

192
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,361
is to survive.

193
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,721
So if there's something you can't ask

194
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:40,721
a guy who hasn't slept in five days

195
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:41,841
is patience."

196
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:43,801
Let's go.

197
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,321
Take off your clothes.

198
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:12,921
T-shirt too.

199
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,641
I have a shoulder injury...
Take off your shirt!

200
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:29,401
- And on top of that you steal from us.
Ole.

201
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,281
This for not killing when
you had to kill.

202
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:35,721
What are you going to do?

203
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:42,481
If I shoot you, you just die.

204
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:44,561
You don't suffer.

205
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:47,321
Now you're gonna go with two
kilos of explosives

206
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:50,721
glued to your body.
I detonate, but you don't know when.

207
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:53,041
- Helsinki, that's a lot of explosive,

208
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:55,161
Be careful, you can make a mess
that you freak out.

209
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,321
- This worm fuck us more than the police.

210
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,961
Oslo dies because of him.

211
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,521
Denver almost died because of him.

212
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:20,281
This is the end of trouble.

213
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:22,881
Eh, Arturito?

214
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:55,881
Don't remove wires, this explodes.

215
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,401
Don't move fast.

216
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,601
Don't sweat it.

217
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:02,601
Don't touch yourself.

218
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,481
Detonator.

219
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,121
If I touch this button, boom!

220
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,161
Not even your wife to recognize.

221
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,761
Mince of Arturito.

222
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,241
Do you have a cigarette?

223
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,841
Do you have a cigarette?
Mónica, you are pregnant.

224
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,881
Pregnant, kidnapped, shot...

225
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,921
And in a moment accused of collaboration

226
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,921
with an armed band.
Don't get into the worst.

227
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,961
Arturo can help you,
he's your son's father, isn't he?

228
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:01,761
What father, what father?

229
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,241
The one who just pointed
me out as one kidnapper?

230
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,681
What father?

231
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:10,361
The one I banged his head on
with an iron stick?

232
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,281
Maybe all my colleagues will help me,

233
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,961
I just screwed up their whole escape plan.

234
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,281
I'm sure they'll say it in court.

235
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:21,161
God! Why have I been so foolish,
where the hell is my head?

236
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:22,881
Come on, give me a cigarette.

237
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,601
Give me a cigarette,
my fetus needs a cigarette.

238
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,641
You're not going to sit on any bench,

239
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,881
because I'd rather blow up Arturo.
- You're not going to destroy anybody, okay?

240
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,401
It's okay.
- But she's right,

241
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:34,881
That if we run away

242
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,721
and the police catch us, she goes to jail.

243
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:39,921
If we stay and they come in, too.
He's going to jail, yes or yes.

244
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,121
Fucking hell.

245
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:50,881
I always make the wrong choice.

246
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:54,401
I always make the wrong choice.

247
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,721
I mess with a married guy.

248
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:03,041
I got pregnant with him.

249
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,641
And then there's another guy,

250
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:10,201
shoots me in the leg.

251
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:14,521
and I go and I fall in love.

252
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,601
You know what we're gonna do?

253
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:21,001
What?
You're coming with us.

254
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,361
If you crossed the line,
you crossed the line,

255
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,601
I'm not gonna leave you lying
in the road, okay?

256
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:28,161
- We can still...
- Yes, she's coming with us.

257
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:30,641
Let her take the place of Tokio
or Oslo and that's it.

258
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:33,681
No, no, listen. I'm just a secretary,

259
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:38,401
I don't see myself running from
the police or shooting

260
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:41,881
or living in hiding I don't know
where, in Cambodia,

261
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,441
in any extradition-free country, no.

262
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,401
I'd better stay.

263
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,721
And when the police come,
I'll tell them

264
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:56,641
I did it because I had a
Stockholm syndrome

265
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,881
like a piano.
And that has extenuating factors.

266
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:02,401
Because that's what it was, isn't it?

267
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:10,641
Stockholm.

268
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,201
That can be nice.

269
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:18,841
If you come with us, you...

270
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,001
I don't know, I could call you Stockholm.

271
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,161
What do I know, dude?

272
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:54,441
Get out.

273
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:22,721
Open the door.

274
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:29,681
Come on in.

275
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:46,601
"We were all exhausted.

276
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:50,521
The lack of sleep,

277
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:53,921
stress,

278
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,641
or the anguish of years of
carrying a secret

279
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:02,081
which in that asphyxiating environment was
becoming more and more difficult to keep.

280
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:08,521
And all of us, sooner or later,
lost our papers.

281
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,401
Except for Berlín, he was the only
one who fulfilled to the letter

282
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,881
the rest protocol.

283
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:20,401
The others were out of their minds."

284
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,561
I've tried to be good.

285
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,321
I've tried to give you what you were promised.

286
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:36,081
Get rid of Berlín,

287
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:39,881
to make sense of this.

288
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:43,241
After losing what I've lost here,

289
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,601
that this made any sense at all.

290
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:48,481
I'm good.

291
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:51,641
I've been good.

292
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:56,681
And the world spits in my face.

293
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:04,721
I've tried to give you oxygen.

294
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,121
and you guys fucked me in the ass.

295
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:13,721
Berlín.

296
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,401
Berlín.

297
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:20,521
Hey, it's been over an hour and a half.

298
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:30,281
- Don't you want to kill me
while I'm sleeping?

299
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,121
A little bit.

300
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:39,241
Hey, hey, you're laughing.

301
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,321
That means you're not afraid
of me anymore.

302
00:24:48,841 --> 00:24:51,681
- Let's just say the dose of
anxiolytics I'm taking

303
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:52,841
has me neutralized.

304
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:04,441
- If all goes well, unlikely thing

305
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:06,761
if I don't take the command again...

306
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,921
If all goes well, I want to
make you a deal,

307
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:15,081
a romantic business.

308
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:21,641
A few days later I'll send
you a plane ticket.

309
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:26,801
Somewhere far away.

310
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:29,641
If you want,

311
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:33,761
you can come with me.

312
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,321
Very little time,

313
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:39,961
a lot of whimsy.

314
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:47,761
And then, already after the end,

315
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:53,041
you can keep everything I have.

316
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:02,641
It would be really wonderful
if you fell in love with me so much.

317
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:10,481
But I don't live on expectations,

318
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:12,761
of false illusions.

319
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:18,081
I have many faults and I know it.

320
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:25,361
I could settle for you being my partner

321
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:27,681
until the last trip.

322
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:34,641
You and me together till the end.

323
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:22,561
You don't understand, you don't understand.

324
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:30,001
What am I going to have to do
to get you to respect me?

325
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:32,441
What am I gonna have to do?

326
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:36,641
Hey, I'll cut off your ear
and send it to your father?

327
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,281
Or I'll shoot you in the leg
so you can't dance again.

328
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,001
in your fucking life?
- A great idea!

329
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,721
It's time to be practical.

330
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:56,521
The utopia of collaboration has failed.

331
00:27:58,721 --> 00:27:59,681
Nairobi

332
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:07,441
I appreciate you allowing me to
take some time off

333
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,561
in my duties.

334
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:14,401
But we're already for me to return to command.

335
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,721
- All yours.

336
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:27,361
- This is a wonderful moment.

337
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,481
On your feet!

338
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:52,041
I told you I was going to protect
you, didn't I?

339
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:56,081
But I've changed my mind.

340
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,601
Much more practical: torturing you.

341
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:11,321
In the concentration camps

342
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:15,001
respect is taken for granted.

343
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:18,201
Well, it's gonna be the same here.

344
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:21,801
You're going to make the tunnel

345
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,681
Until your hands bleed!

346
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:31,081
At night you could cry in pain

347
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:36,121
on your bed, but then... You're
going to keep chopping stone!

348
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:44,521
You will rotate in your task without rest

349
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:48,321
and if not, an epic punishment awaits you.

350
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:52,361
Like your leader.

351
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,721
A man who, if he betrays again, kills.

352
00:30:06,961 --> 00:30:09,641
That if he ever longs for freedom again,
he kills.

353
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:15,281
If you sweat a lot...

354
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,241
Kill.

355
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:21,081
A man with an explosive character.

356
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,081
Now you're going to scare them, Arturo,

357
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,561
even though we've all known that
you're the bomb.

358
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:39,441
Since you're a stinker, you're
going to stay here apart.

359
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,121
Helsinki, everybody else to the tunnel!

360
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,681
- Come on, let's go! Let's go, quick!

361
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:56,681
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

362
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:59,001
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

363
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:02,281
Boom.

364
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:07,121
Seismographs have located unusual activity

365
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,961
in the basement of the factory,
it seems that the kidnappers

366
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:12,481
have increased the pace of tunnel excavation,

367
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,921
they're about to take him in.
- How much do they have left?

368
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,481
- According to the georadar, two meters, 2.5.
- And where are they going to take it?

369
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:24,361
- We believe that here, in a
collector about 15 meters

370
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,961
behind the building.

371
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:30,241
- Attention everyone, I want you all ready!

372
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:32,281
Warn the subsoil, be warned.

373
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:34,281
And I want 20 men on that collector now.

374
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:48,201
Do you know what the guilty ones
do when they take them

375
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:49,321
to the crime scene?

376
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:51,921
They keep talking.

377
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:56,401
Of time, of politics, they click...

378
00:31:57,841 --> 00:31:58,921
It's the nerves,

379
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:02,241
because they can't stand silence.

380
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:05,721
But you...

381
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,401
You don't say anything.

382
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,201
What do you want me to talk about, Raquel?

383
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,801
Who are you?
Sergio Marquina.

384
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:31,201
Sergio? Salva? The Profesor?

385
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:35,961
The person who's been keeping
all the police, the CNI

386
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,361
and the special corps?

387
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,481
The man I've been talking to

388
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:42,161
five days on the phone,

389
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,721
I told him what clothes I was wearing.

390
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,001
and even what colour my orgasms are.

391
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:52,601
And which one are you?

392
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,921
Why aren't your fingerprints
in the database

393
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:02,921
of the National Identity Card?

394
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:08,481
I stopped renewing it before they started

395
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:09,841
to digitize it.

396
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:13,601
When?
I don't know.

397
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,521
More than 20 years ago.

398
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:29,321
That opens up a world of possibilities,
doesn't it?

399
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:34,361
Because no one's gonna report a man missing

400
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,601
that just doesn't exist.

401
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:42,001
I'm not even going to have to
make an effort

402
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,401
to burn your corpse well.

403
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:48,201
Is that what you want?

404
00:33:50,641 --> 00:33:51,721
Kill me and burn me?

405
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:56,441
Yes.

406
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:58,281
I'm telling you, I do.

407
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,201
Oh, look,

408
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:06,961
maybe, as an inspector, I shouldn't
tell you this

409
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:09,401
to the person who has organized the
robbery with hostages

410
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:11,401
to the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda,

411
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:14,761
but as a woman,

412
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:20,841
as a woman who's spent years being
afraid of everything,

413
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:22,841
to everything,

414
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:26,801
and she's trusted someone,
someone who knowing

415
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:30,721
how fragile and vulnerable I was,
he's been cheating on me

416
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:33,401
from the beginning,
from the fucking beginning,

417
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:37,001
I don't think it's that far-fetched,
do you?

418
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:41,961
You could... You could have approached me,

419
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:46,441
pull me out, put me on a fucking mic,

420
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:48,361
A fucking mic, damn it!

421
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,601
But no, no, it's not.

422
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,801
Yesterday we were dreaming together.

423
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:57,961
Fucking hell.

424
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,441
Speaking of future, of future.

425
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:08,681
Who the fuck are you? What are you,
a disturbed fuck?

426
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,601
It was all planned, Raquel.

427
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,401
Everything, it was everything.

428
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:21,601
I'm so sorry, it was all planned.

429
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:23,681
Except for what happened between us.

430
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:25,961
I don't know, I broke my own rule.

431
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:27,241
What?
I don't know.

432
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:30,681
I haven't looked at that variable.
What the fuck are you saying,

433
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,721
which variable?
To fall in love with you.

434
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:39,201
You really think I'm gonna let you
go through with this fucking shit?

435
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:40,961
Hey, motherfucker?

436
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,561
That I'm going to stand idly by

437
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:47,081
while you keep lying to me like
I'm a 15-year-old girl?

438
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:48,681
I'm not lying to you, Raquel.

439
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:51,041
I've fallen in love with you.

440
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,201
Tell me again, tell me again.

441
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,601
Dare to tell me again, tell me.

442
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:02,201
Raquel, I've fallen in love with you.

443
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:16,681
I'm so sorry.

444
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:25,921
All right, all right.

445
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,921
Berlín, I want to talk to you.

446
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,441
- Sure, I'm the boss again.

447
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,561
I need my puppies' food.

448
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:58,681
- What exactly did the Profesor
say to you about Tokio?

449
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,601
- He told me he was going to
try to free her.

450
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:05,041
- And how the hell is he gonna
release her all by himself?

451
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:11,681
- Río, he's not going to do it.

452
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,161
- Who?

453
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:17,481
- The four Serbs who dug the tunnel
five years ago.

454
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:22,201
They're the wild card for extreme setbacks.

455
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:25,161
- When?
I don't know.

456
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,441
You notice her absence, don't you?

457
00:38:35,281 --> 00:38:37,441
Those who stay always have it more fucked up.

458
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:40,361
Her, on the other hand,

459
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,641
will be broadening her experience,

460
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:48,081
enlarging their sensations.

461
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,561
Would you have liked to take the
deal with the cops?

462
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:56,601
Total

463
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:01,361
what would happen if we got out of here,
stayed together?

464
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,641
Are you talking about betraying your friends?

465
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,321
My friends with a city name?

466
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,881
Tokio, Berlín, Moscú, Denver...

467
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,601
Well, to me, my friends with a city name

468
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:17,001
they look fucking awesome to me.
And I'll tell you something,

469
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:19,601
try to hide if you take the deal.

470
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:23,401
Because if I see you,
I'll shoot you in the head.

471
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:26,961
Women always move on before.

472
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:28,961
Just in case, you should be warned.

473
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:34,241
- Tokio is impulsive,

474
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:36,441
but she's coming back.

475
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,721
And we're gonna end up together.

476
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:41,801
I know it.

477
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,601
- Sure, I'm sure.

478
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,881
I've always thought so.

479
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:13,681
If you betray us and come out,

480
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:18,041
and you need to call me when you're sorry...

481
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:23,561
Because believe me, you'll regret it.

482
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:29,561
You can call me on Alison's cell,
I'll keep it open.

483
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:34,401
The police will listen to us,
but what difference does it make?

484
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:59,521
Suárez, Alison Parker's phone is on.

485
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:03,321
- Try to hack it.

486
00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:04,761
- Sealed chamber, sir.

487
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,961
They're not calling or sending anything.

488
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,441
What the hell is this?
- Fucking hell.

489
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:47,881
This is Convoy 727, we're being assaulted.
- This is central, we haven't understood you.

490
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,081
Please repeat.

491
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:52,441
- They have inhibitors.
- Fucking hell!

492
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:54,601
"My guardian angel had not forsaken me

493
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:57,561
and I felt like I was on the witch's train."

494
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:02,121
It's a fucking bomb!
- What the hell's going on out front?

495
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:03,681
- We've been glued with an explosive!

496
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:05,561
"In a dark tunnel where you don't know

497
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,401
where a broom's gonna rain on you,

498
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:09,601
but what fun."

499
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:12,321
What's going on?
What the hell's going on?

500
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,201
They're fucking killing us!
- Shut the fuck up!

501
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:19,081
- We're fucked!
- Shut the fuck up, I need to think!

502
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,881
- Get on the ground!

503
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:54,801
- Alert.

504
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:07,881
Okay, okay, no, no, no.

505
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:16,921
- Put your guns down or I'll kill her.

506
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:20,561
Put your guns down or I'll kill her.

507
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,481
- If you shoot girl, you die.

508
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:27,681
If you shoot me, you die.

509
00:43:28,841 --> 00:43:31,601
If you let go girl, you live.

510
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,161
"May all the decisions of this world

511
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,521
were so easy, right?"

512
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:54,481
Río.

513
00:43:56,641 --> 00:43:57,601
Río.

514
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,721
Down there, I realized you didn't agree

515
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:05,041
with what Helsinki was doing.

516
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:08,561
You're not like them.

517
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:12,841
You're a good boy.

518
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:21,161
I have a son your age too,
you know? The oldest.

519
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:26,361
The older one's a good boy, too.

520
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:30,121
Help me, please.

521
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:33,841
I want to see my son.

522
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:01,961
I found this passport-making machine.

523
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:04,881
No, no, no.
Mónica, Mónica.

524
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:07,441
You listen to me.

525
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:12,961
You can do whatever you want,
but what if you change your mind?

526
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:16,161
I thought you could really use a new one.

527
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:18,921
Besides, this is real, it's good gender.

528
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:21,281
I know, I work here.
Well, it doesn't cost you anything.

529
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:24,041
We do it. If you don't want it later,
throw it away, burn it

530
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:26,081
or you take it as a souvenir,
whatever you want.

531
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:28,401
It's only two minutes.

532
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:30,841
Shall we?
Come on, okay.

533
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:33,521
Did you plug it in?
Yes.

534
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:34,881
Okay.

535
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:37,241
What's my name?

536
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,641
Ágata.
Ágata?

537
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:44,441
What's going on?
Well, it's a name

538
00:45:44,601 --> 00:45:47,721
of a porn actress.
Ágata is the name of a hot chick.

539
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:49,761
If you were ugly, I'd tell you to get...

540
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:52,921
I don't know, Felisa or Mari Cruz...
María, María Fernández.

541
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:55,121
María Fernández? That's not a name,

542
00:45:55,281 --> 00:45:58,161
no one believes that.
Trust me, I understand these things.

543
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:00,441
More discreet.
Ágata sounds expensive, has class.

544
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:01,561
Write Ágata.

545
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:04,281
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

546
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:11,601
Write born in Madrid.

547
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:15,321
And the year, whatever you want.

548
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,321
We're making a passport.
- I see.

549
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:24,641
- In case she runs away or...

550
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:26,921
she's coming with us.

551
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,041
- Who do you think stole your gun?

552
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:40,401
- Come out.

553
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:49,521
Suárez.

554
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,481
- Sir, I'm calling from the National High Court.

555
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:54,681
The convoy transporting Silene Oliveira

556
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:56,561
It should've been here 15 minutes ago

557
00:46:56,721 --> 00:47:00,041
and it hasn't arrived, we don't have any news.
- Keep me informed.

558
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:03,761
Gómez, I need two units doing the tour

559
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,161
of Silene Oliveira to the court.
He has not yet arrived

560
00:47:06,321 --> 00:47:08,681
and I need to know what's going on.
- Understood.

561
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:18,961
Put this on.

562
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:03,841
Only contact: Profesor.

563
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:06,481
He says what to do.

564
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:48,441
"Never in my life have I felt so free.

565
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,841
But that time the Profesor's plan

566
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,161
was not going to work."

567
00:49:09,441 --> 00:49:10,841
I know I may have been under pressure.

568
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:16,241
That I was wrong, but please,

569
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:20,561
I don't deserve this.

570
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:26,641
Please, I'm asking you,

571
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:29,921
if there's any dignity left in you...
Please.

572
00:49:30,841 --> 00:49:32,001
I can't breathe.

573
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:34,121
I can't breathe, help me.

574
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:37,241
Help me, please.

575
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:39,041
We're coming in.

576
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:45,881
We take food and sit down.

577
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:50,041
Each one a metre away from the other.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

578
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:59,081
That's it, that's it, with joy.

579
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:02,721
Helsinki, say hello to Arturito.
Arturito.

580
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:15,921
There's something here that doesn't
make any sense.

581
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:19,121
I've been told before that if I sweat at all,

582
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:21,641
I will blow away. And yet,
they have me here,

583
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:25,121
enclosed with this unbearable demon heat,
with this heat...

584
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:28,721
It's best if you're calm and quiet.

585
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:30,561
It doesn't make any sense.
What?

586
00:50:30,721 --> 00:50:33,401
The bomb doesn't make any sense.
Do you think these people

587
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:35,321
was going to risk me tripping

588
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,961
or to sweat so that the whole plan

589
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:38,881
to will blow away? No.

590
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:44,441
No, it would be really crazy,
these people don't work that way.

591
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,281
Shut up.
They're making us

592
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:48,601
psychological terrorism,
don't you see?

593
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:52,281
They're trying to scare us, it's not real,
it's a bluff.

594
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:54,361
I have no idea, but I don't want to know.

595
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:56,961
So shut up.
I'm going to take it off, I've decided.

596
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,201
I take it off, I can't take it anymore.

597
00:50:59,281 --> 00:51:02,121
I'm gonna take it off. It's all right.
Don't you see that if I were to explode,

598
00:51:02,281 --> 00:51:04,361
You wouldn't...
Be still and sit down.

599
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,201
Who the hell are you to tell us what to do?

600
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:10,721
It's your fault that we're locked in here.

601
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:18,961
Because of me?
Yes, because of you.

602
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:23,601
You're the director of this place
and you've been snuck eight crazies

603
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:25,081
like Peter in his house.

604
00:51:25,921 --> 00:51:28,681
Are there any Money Factories in the
world that have been robbed?

605
00:51:28,841 --> 00:51:30,201
Just this one, right?

606
00:51:33,881 --> 00:51:36,961
Congratulations, because you've made history.

607
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:40,441
Now, please, don't make us all blow away.

608
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:42,681
Have a seat.

609
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,361
Have a seat.

610
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,881
Central, do you copy?
The van has been assaulted,

611
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:05,201
there's no sign of Silene Oliveira.
- Received. Wait for instructions.

612
00:52:06,841 --> 00:52:10,641
- Attention, we have a fugitive,
we activate Operation Cage!

613
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:38,801
"He wasn't there.

614
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:41,481
He wasn't there.

615
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:46,121
If he'd arranged everything,
if he'd sent for me to be saved,

616
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:48,641
how could he not be there?

617
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:51,521
That October afternoon they had
deployed for my escape

618
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:54,601
Operation Cage. You will know about it
when there were attacks.

619
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:57,201
It consists of the police cutting in

620
00:52:57,361 --> 00:52:59,961
all the exits from the city,
everything collapses.

621
00:53:00,521 --> 00:53:02,961
and you get trapped,
you can only hide.

622
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:05,881
My problem was that the hideout
was the hangar

623
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,201
and it was the Profesor who had to open it for me.

624
00:53:09,961 --> 00:53:12,201
And the truth is, I was never good at waiting."

625
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:57,761
What's that?

626
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:02,641
The only real thing I know about you
is that you're a professional liar.

627
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:08,041
And call me paranoid, but you're
not gonna lie to me again.

628
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:09,921
not one more time, I assure you.

629
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:18,481
What do you think, I don't know,
I'm an asshole?

630
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:22,161
Of course she stole my gun,
but she regretted it.

631
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:25,521
If he doesn't regret it,
he'd be in a box with Oslo by now.

632
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:27,881
- Okay, he helped you, and welcome,
but that's not why

633
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,641
you have to give her a passport
or take her on the run.

634
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,321
- What if I want to do it?
What if I want to go live with her

635
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,041
and take care of her son, what's going on?
- Pretty fucked up

636
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:38,761
you're gonna have to carry someone else's backpack.

637
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:41,321
- They're not backpacks, she's an woman
who loves me and her son,

638
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,401
as far as I know,
he's not to blame.

639
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:46,521
- Nor do you have the obligation to get in trouble.
- I don't do it out of obligation.

640
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:50,081
- Sometimes we try to help someone,
but the first to sink is oneself.

641
00:54:50,241 --> 00:54:52,601
- Well, I'll swim, like we've done
all our fucking lives.

642
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:53,761
- It's not like that, damn it!

643
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:55,681
I know that.

644
00:54:58,001 --> 00:55:00,801
That I tried to help your mother
every fucking day of my life.

645
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:07,401
- What's with the shit now?

646
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:10,801
Mom left us.

647
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:13,761
What the fuck is that all about now?

648
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:16,521
Hey.

649
00:55:18,801 --> 00:55:20,121
- We abandoned her.

650
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:23,921
Because it was going to lead us to the abyss.

651
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:29,201
I admitted her to a clinic in Barcelona.

652
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:32,441
200 000 pesetas cost me.

653
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:35,801
And in less than 24 hours he
showed up at my hostel.

654
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:38,801
High as hell.
- What did you do?

655
00:55:40,281 --> 00:55:43,481
- It was the fourth time I
lost my savings.

656
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:45,641
- What the fuck did you do?

657
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:51,361
- She wanted to go buy some more.

658
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:57,281
I put her in the car, left her in a
Martorell roundabout,

659
00:55:57,441 --> 00:55:59,681
next to a village that sold drug.

660
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:06,241
But I didn't wait for her.

661
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:11,241
I came back to get you to move us.

662
00:56:14,561 --> 00:56:16,681
- Did you leave my mother in
a roundabout?

663
00:56:23,161 --> 00:56:25,321
- That's why I got you into
all this stuff,

664
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:27,681
because I don't want you to live
the life I lived,

665
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:30,401
because I want you to be free,
I want you to start...

666
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:34,601
- A mother isn't abandoned,
she's detoxified.

667
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:38,561
All my life making me think she was a bitch,

668
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:42,321
thinking that maybe she was gone because of me.

669
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:48,561
It was her or us, son.

670
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:52,961
- Oh, my God!

671
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:57,361
I'm not opening your head because we need you

672
00:56:57,521 --> 00:56:58,601
to get out of here.

673
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,161
As soon as we get out, you and I are nothing.

674
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:08,921
Two strangers, Denver and Moscú.

675
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,681
Are you done with your passport?

676
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:44,841
Yes.

677
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:48,161
Denver, are you okay?

678
00:58:10,401 --> 00:58:11,921
I've put on Ágata.

679
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,561
"He was driving frantically nowhere.

680
00:58:51,921 --> 00:58:53,921
I knew where to go in a fraction of a second.

681
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:58,201
The bad news is, it was the most watched point

682
00:58:58,361 --> 00:58:59,921
of all Spanish geography."

683
00:59:35,881 --> 00:59:37,121
Take a deep breath.

684
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:44,321
Are you nervous?

685
00:59:46,441 --> 00:59:47,401
No, I'm fine.

686
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:52,441
See those lines over there?

687
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:57,161
Every lie of yours will result
in some very ugly curves

688
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:01,121
for altered blood pressure,

689
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:04,281
heart rate, respiratory rate...

690
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:08,441
So don't lie to me or I'll know.

691
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:14,401
Name.

692
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:17,241
Sergio Marquina.

693
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:22,641
Place of birth.

694
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:26,161
San Sebastian.

695
01:00:29,561 --> 01:00:31,841
Did you know you were going to destroy Ángel?

696
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:39,721
Yes.

697
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:47,441
Was it you who caused his accident?

698
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:49,161
No.

699
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:56,801
Was the Fábrica de Moneda
robbery your idea?

700
01:00:58,401 --> 01:00:59,401
No.

701
01:01:05,401 --> 01:01:06,401
Who came up with that?

702
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:08,801
My father.

703
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:13,561
He died before he could be executed,
this is a kind of tribute.

704
01:01:19,081 --> 01:01:20,841
The story of the fucking apples.

705
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:24,041
The fucking history of Organic Cider

706
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:28,761
you told me yesterday in bed was
the story of the robbery.

707
01:01:30,841 --> 01:01:33,441
And me listening to you like an asshole,

708
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:36,361
you've been laughing at me...
I haven't been laughing at you.

709
01:01:36,521 --> 01:01:39,001
From the first moment.
I haven't been laughing at you,

710
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:40,561
Look at the polygraph, please.

711
01:01:41,441 --> 01:01:42,561
Look at it.

712
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:48,681
My father had a sick child,

713
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:51,481
not a fucking cent.

714
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:54,681
What would you have done?

715
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:59,401
He spent the day thinking about robberies

716
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:02,881
to pay for a hospital in the U.S.

717
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,961
Out of desperation,

718
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,961
for saving my life.

719
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:12,601
Me.

720
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:17,121
Because nobody,

721
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:22,641
no one helped him.

722
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:28,241
And in that endeavour,
he was shot to death.

723
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:34,761
In the door of a bank.

724
01:02:38,361 --> 01:02:40,081
That's the reality.

725
01:02:44,201 --> 01:02:46,761
I guess there's a lot of ways to
understand what's fair.

726
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:52,001
You thought I was easy prey because
I was a battered woman.

727
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:01,921
Yes, I did.

728
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:09,761
When you leaked to the press my
refusal to release eight hostages

729
01:03:09,921 --> 01:03:11,521
in favor of Alison Parker,

730
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,641
you knew I was going to be publicly lynchered,

731
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:17,641
that you were going to destroy my career
and my mother was going to see it.

732
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:18,881
and my daughter.

733
01:03:19,521 --> 01:03:20,721
Yes.

734
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:24,441
Oh, yeah.

735
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:29,121
You slept with me just because
I'm the lead inspector.

736
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:30,281
of the case, right?
No.

737
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:34,001
You slept with me because
I'm the lead inspector?

738
01:03:34,161 --> 01:03:35,761
No.
Stop fucking lying to me!

739
01:03:35,921 --> 01:03:36,921
I'm not lying to you.

740
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:39,321
You want me to believe you have
feelings for me?

741
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,121
I'm not making you believe anything,
Raquel, that's how I feel.

742
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:45,441
I didn't expect it,
but it's happening to me,

743
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:47,601
it's happened to me and
it's happening to you too.

744
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:52,881
It's happened to you too,
otherwise what are we doing here, huh?

745
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:00,281
Why am I not in a cell,
what the hell is this?

746
01:04:02,081 --> 01:04:04,441
What are you now, Misery's crazy or what is this?

747
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:07,201
It's something that's happening
to both of us, you know?

748
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:08,361
It happened to both of us.

749
01:04:15,921 --> 01:04:17,081
Yes, Suárez.

750
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:21,241
- Inspector, Silene Oliveira has escaped.

751
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,641
- What?
- I was on my way to the courthouse,

752
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:26,801
had asked to testify before the judge.
The convoy has been assaulted

753
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:29,961
by a group of subjects from the east.
I have activated Operation Cage,

754
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:32,481
I hope they haven't left the
Community of Madrid.

755
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:35,801
- Ask the judge for an international
arrest warrant,

756
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:39,161
I want you to shield roads,
ports and airports.

757
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,961
Have them patrol all the borders.

758
01:04:52,281 --> 01:04:53,481
Tokio has escaped.

759
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:58,321
You're the one who pulled out a murderer

760
01:04:58,481 --> 01:05:01,601
from a maximum-security prison
while I'm holding you here?

761
01:05:08,841 --> 01:05:11,521
I actually left everything ready
before I met you

762
01:05:11,681 --> 01:05:12,641
in the cafeteria.

763
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:25,041
I'm sorry to see you like this,
but I just got here.

764
01:05:28,281 --> 01:05:30,161
Darko, I'm so sorry about your brother.

765
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:37,401
Let's go.

766
01:05:42,241 --> 01:05:44,321
You've got it all figured out
to the millimeter, haven't you?

767
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:46,441
Raquel, I told you everything.

768
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:54,961
I came all this way without offering
any kind of resistance.

769
01:05:57,201 --> 01:05:58,721
And if I let you interrogate me,

770
01:06:00,721 --> 01:06:05,121
It's because I wanted to be honest with you.
I can't take it anymore

771
01:06:05,881 --> 01:06:07,601
this lie.
Shut up.

772
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:10,081
I didn't mean to hurt you anymore.
Shut up!

773
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:12,401
All this is...
Shut the fuck up,

774
01:06:12,561 --> 01:06:13,601
Holy shit!

775
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:18,801
I'm not listening to you anymore.
Look, from now on

776
01:06:18,961 --> 01:06:21,801
whatever you have to say,
you say directly to the judge.

777
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:25,761
Get up.

778
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,681
Get the fuck up!

779
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:34,321
Go, go, go

780
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:41,161
Keep walking.

781
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:45,321
I'm so sorry, Raquel.
Keep going...!

782
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:53,121
I'm going to shoot.
I'm go...

783
01:07:16,681 --> 01:07:19,201
"Have you ever heard of putting
yourself in the wolf's mouth?"

784
01:07:29,481 --> 01:07:31,441
It's a call to Alison Parker's phone.

785
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:33,721
from an unknown number.
Locate it.

786
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:46,161
Yes?.
Río.

787
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:48,801
I'm Tokio.

788
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:53,721
It's Silene Oliveira.
- Record. Locate the call.

789
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:57,161
- Where are you?
Wait, they're listening.

790
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:01,041
I don't care, this is a love call.

791
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:03,241
And the police love love.

792
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:09,401
Listen, do you remember the door
my mother used to draw for me

793
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:10,521
when I was afraid?

794
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:13,161
What door are you talking about?

795
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:16,201
- Yes, love, of course I remember.
What's wrong?

796
01:08:16,361 --> 01:08:20,681
I'm gonna cross it,
I'm gonna cross the door to heaven.

797
01:08:21,281 --> 01:08:23,161
Because my guardian angel doesn't show up.

798
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:28,801
In a minute.

799
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:34,841
I love you.
And I love you too.

800
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:56,761
What the hell was that call?
- It looked like a farewell.

801
01:09:12,761 --> 01:09:15,441
- Attention, sir, an unauthorized
vehicle is entering.

802
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:17,761
on the perimeter.
- Let's go, everybody!

803
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:25,201
Hey, hey.

804
01:09:25,681 --> 01:09:26,641
That's her.

805
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:29,841
Door, door.

806
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:32,721
Fuck, the door.

807
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:36,841
Hey, hey, hey.

808
01:09:38,761 --> 01:09:41,201
Attention, it's Silene Oliveira!

809
01:09:44,401 --> 01:09:45,921
Tokio's coming back!

810
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:50,081
- Tokio's coming back,
get back on the ground!

811
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:53,001
- We have to open the door, dammit!

812
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:56,481
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

813
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,081
Let's go! Let's go!

814
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:13,521
No! We've got to cover it up,
damn it!

815
01:10:15,201 --> 01:10:16,281
- Kidnapper in sight.

816
01:10:18,121 --> 01:10:19,201
Dad, look out!

817
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:23,801
- Unit three, behind you, behind you!

818
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,161
Fucking hell!

819
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:15,921
Fucking hell!

820
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:49,521
Moscú!

821
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,241
- Moscú!

822
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:36,801
You have to get out as soon as possible.

823
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:41,001
I've been discovered, Andrés,
I don't know how long

824
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:43,241
it's gonna take the police to show up here.

825
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,241
Have you located the inspector?

826
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:07,921
Fucking hell!
