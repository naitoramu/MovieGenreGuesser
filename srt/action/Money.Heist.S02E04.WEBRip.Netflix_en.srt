1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,040
Check-up call.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
-Everything is running smoothly over here.
-S<i>moothly?</i>

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,560
Smoothly as in Tokyo being interrogated?

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
As in you're about to execute Rio?

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>Berlin, what are you doing?</i>

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,080
Professor, it's Nairobi.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,680
<i>Berlin is indisposed.</i>
<i>So from now on, I'm in charge.</i>

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,200
Let the matriarchy begin.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,520
<i>If we took a photo of this moment</i>

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
<i>it could be my last memory</i>
<i>of the Royal Mint of Spain.</i>

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,920
<i>Leaving a string of mistakes inside,</i>

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,480
<i>a weakened group,</i>

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,320
<i>and only one with the guts</i>
<i>to pull their weight:</i>

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>Nairobi.</i>

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,200
What I mean, Professor,
is that this is out of control.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,640
<i>The situation is critical.</i>

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,000
Tokyo played Russian roulette
with Berlin tied to a chair.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,440
<i>Berlin turned her in.</i>

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,800
And then, Rio deserted

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,360
and Berlin almost executed him
like some fucking Vietnamese firing squad.

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
Helsinki suffocated Oslo.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,960
He killed him?

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,280
<i>He was a vegetal.</i>

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>Helsinki says he would have wanted it.</i>

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,040
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>this is a fucking disaster,</i>

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,640
so I have no choice but to take control

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,640
until things get back on track!

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,160
Ask him what the hell he was doing
with the police.

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,920
I was at the house in Toledo,
it was part of the plan.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,720
<i>Professor,</i>

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,000
we need to know what situation we're in.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
MONDAY 09:00 PM

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,840
There are some loose ends,
I'm not going to lie.

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
HOUR 83 OF THE HEIST

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>I'd say it was the biggest loose end</i>
<i>of all.</i>

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>Assistant Inspector Angel</i>
<i>had discovered the Professor.</i>

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
<i>He had his fingerprints</i>

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,120
<i>and was in a coma</i>
<i>waiting to wake up and reveal it.</i>

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
<i>The Professor was living on</i>
<i>borrowed time.</i>

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
<i>As was everyone else.</i>

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,360
The situation in there isn't
much better from what you say.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,680
<i>Look,</i>

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,160
you do what you have to do,

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,440
I'll fix things in here
in the meantime.

45
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,600
I'll put the call through,
probably from the tent.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Inspector.

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
Before I get to the point I need
to clarify something.

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,680
<i>What do I call you now?</i>

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,360
<i>Professor?</i>

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
<i>Sergio? Or...</i>

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,520
<i>Mr. Marquina?</i>

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,960
I'll always be the Professor to you.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
That's how we met.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,840
<i>You'll always be Inspector Murillo to me,</i>

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,960
<i>even if you become my executioner.</i>

56
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,760
Remember the first time you made love?

57
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
Of course. One doesn't forget that.

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,880
Well, this is my first time

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
in the world of crime.

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,120
And no matter what, I will always

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
remember it fondly.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
<i>You're an enthusiast.</i>

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
And this world needs people like you.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I hope that when you get out of prison

65
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,240
<i>you'll help the country progress.</i>

66
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,640
Because the truth is that...

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
<i>Where did it happen?</i>

68
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

69
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
The first time you made love.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
In a tent.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,400
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,880
That's a good place for a first time.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,240
The sounds of the countryside,
the lights...

74
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,400
Yes, that was right.

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
The rest was, let's say...

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,520
experimental and...

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,560
brief.

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,600
Okay, Professor.

79
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,520
I'm calling to inform you
that Silene Oliveira

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,360
<i>is going into provisional custody</i>
<i>without bail tonight.</i>

81
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
What did she say to make you angry

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,920
and skip the 72-hour custody?

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She was trying to be smart.

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,240
There's something I don't get.

85
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,720
<i>Why do you let go of your people</i>
<i>instead of the hostages?</i>

86
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
There have been
discrepancies in the group.

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
-Nothing else.
-You're against the ropes.

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
<i>-And you know it.</i>
-I admit you're winning,

89
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,240
but this is only one battle.

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,520
<i>It's nothing compared to the war.</i>

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,960
He still teases you,
with a riot on his hands?

92
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,760
He's a rock star.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,680
<i>Salva,</i>

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
<i>how are you doing?</i>

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
How are you holding up?

96
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,480
Well...

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,360
I never thought tying my shoelaces
could be this painful.

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,280
Those bruises could use some care.

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,000
A nurse.

100
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,480
That's a very suggestive proposal.

101
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,760
I'd love to look after you, but...

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,120
It would have to be at my place.
I want to see my daughter and...

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,640
<i>I know that's not the most romantic date.</i>

104
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,800
I can't think of a better date.

105
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Okay.

106
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,080
<i>When you spend years</i>
<i>obsessing about something,</i>

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
<i>that something</i>

108
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,800
<i>is your whole world.</i>

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,400
<i>A perfect world.</i>

110
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>But now the plan</i>
<i>was not only the Professor's.</i>

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,560
<i>It belonged to all of us.</i>

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,040
<i>And we were all screwing it up.</i>

113
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,160
<i>For once, the Professor felt weakened.</i>

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,480
<i>And crawling into Raquel's arms</i>
<i>seemed like the best refuge.</i>

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
<i>The only one possible.</i>

116
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,840
Now you're a hostage too.

117
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
What's the matter?

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,560
They tried to kill me.

119
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,360
They almost did.

120
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,160
Why did they want to kill you?

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
They turned Tokyo in.

122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,280
I was going to turn myself in too.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,880
Alison!

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,080
Leave her.

125
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,720
She's lost her mind!

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
If Tokyo shows up,
who knows what could happen.

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,240
You heard him, she's been kicked out.

128
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,200
This could actually be good.

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,680
-Good for what?
-To get out, damn it!

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
For good!

131
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,480
Is it that hard to understand?

132
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,320
They have locked up our colleagues

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
when they had promised them freedom!

134
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,160
Some of us have been truly humiliated.

135
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
They've ruined my relationship

136
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,640
and my future paternity.

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,480
And regarding the money that they
promised us,

138
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,360
it's all a lie.

139
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,960
A fucking sham!

140
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,840
He confirmed it!

141
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,920
How long are we going to stay
and do nothing?

142
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
The thieves are weakened now.

143
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,520
No one can argue.
And if we don't seize this opportunity,

144
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,200
we'll be letting them escape.
We have to finish them off!

145
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,200
Muster up all the dignity, the
courage, the wild animal we carry inside!

146
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,120
We must do something.

147
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,240
I don't know...

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
steal a gun from them.

149
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,560
What?

150
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
What are you saying?

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Where are we going to get a gun?

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,480
Swapping one of theirs for a fake one.

153
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,240
If you manage
to get one of the fake weapons

154
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,960
you could swap it.

155
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,720
Then one of them will be unarmed

156
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
and one of you armed.

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
Oh, hello, dear.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
-Mom, what are you doing here this late?
-Mommy!

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,240
Sweetheart.

160
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Come here.

161
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,320
Come here.

162
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,240
But wait a minute.

163
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,840
Tell me, what are you doing up so late?

164
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,880
I wanted to see you before going to bed.

165
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,040
Me too, baby.

166
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
Hi.

167
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,800
Hello.

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,760
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've made dinner.

169
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,200
You came for dinner, right?

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes. Dinner and sleep, actually.

171
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,480
Right?

172
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,800
Are you dating?

173
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,320
Oh, dear.

174
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Well, uh.

175
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,480
Yes, right?

176
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,800
Kind of.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,280
But have you asked her?

178
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,480
Actually, I haven't. But...

179
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,360
we kissed, which is...

180
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
almost the same.

181
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,400
Okay.

182
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,880
Come on, Paulita. Let's go.

183
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
You have school tomorrow.

184
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
No, don’t worry.

185
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,680
I'll tuck her in.

186
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,040
Thank you.

187
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
Did you really hit him?

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,080
Well...

189
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,720
yes, I did.

190
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,200
It infuriated me
to think he'd hurt you.

191
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
I don't like violence.
Never have.

192
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,800
I know it's wrong
and you can defend yourself.

193
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,320
-It's not my bussiness, but...
-Salva.

194
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm glad you hit
the jerk of my ex-husband.

195
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
I should have done it myself.

196
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,760
Even if it's wrong to say so.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,840
Well...

198
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,880
sometimes what's wrong is...

199
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,640
the only choice.

200
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm speaking from experience.

201
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm glad you're here.

202
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,200
Okay from now on
I need everybody closing bags.

203
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,320
Non-stop!

204
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,960
You won't mention the lies?

205
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,680
Arturo, drop the Gandhi crap

206
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,840
or you'll eat shit
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

207
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,400
Besides, I guarantee you
that I haven't lied to anyone.

208
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,680
Nairobi is in charge now.
So everyone get packing!

209
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
Nairobi has a heavy hand for a woman.

210
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,120
Berlin, we're sinking.

211
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,640
The most important thing
is to get out of here alive

212
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,760
without making any more mistakes.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,280
You tell me. Are you with me...

214
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,320
or against me?

215
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,160
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

216
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,960
-catch a tiger by the toe,
-A tiger by the toe.

217
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Well, I'm going with you, Nairobi.

218
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
Until the end.

219
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm going to abide by your coup.

220
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,840
And I'll even confess that I am turned on

221
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,360
by the idea of serving a woman
who is a goddess.

222
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,520
You better pray to this goddess,

223
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,160
because she's got your morphine.
Don't forget.

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,840
That's the office where they keep
the fake guns.

225
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,400
-So?
-So one of us has to get in there

226
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,120
and take a blank gun.

227
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
And which one of them
will you switch with?

228
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Denver.

229
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,840
He's the dumbest one.

230
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,440
-And who will take his gun?
-Must be Monica.

231
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,000
-When he calls her in for treatment.
-And why would she do it?

232
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
It's a suicidal risk.

233
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,520
Because that thug shot her.

234
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,920
He's got her in a den

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,440
and he took advantage
of her fear and desperation

236
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,440
to screw her a few times.

237
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,480
And apparently now he left you.

238
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,640
Yes.

239
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,600
But that's what happens.

241
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,280
Sometimes we want to change our lives.

242
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,080
We get our hopes up.

243
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,240
But no heist man will take you with him.

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,960
Fine.

245
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,640
I'll go get the gun.

246
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,160
Do you have copies of the office key?

247
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,440
No.

248
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,160
What is Plan Chernobyl?

249
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,000
Plan Chernobyl is a...

250
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,920
desperate but beautiful plan.

251
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,560
Consists in releasing the cash
in balloons from the roof,

252
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,120
popping the balloons with gunfire
and causing some wonderful rain.

253
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,240
-Calling the media, radio, television...
-Like the Christmas Pageant parade,

254
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,520
but with 50 euro bills.

255
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,320
That's Plan Chernobyl?

256
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,640
Thousands of people picking up the dough,
spreading chaos among the police. Imagine.

257
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,080
A billion euros rain.

258
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,120
Right.

259
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
And us vanishing amongst the frenzied mob.

260
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Very nice.

261
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,480
You know the Professor, an idealist.

262
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,720
He cares more about the message
than the money.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,600
And I didn't say it
because we must respect the timing.

264
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
Wish me luck.

265
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,800
Mr. Torres, in my office!

266
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,360
Come in, Mr Torres.

267
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,240
Let's see...

268
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,000
could we increase the printing rate?

269
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,760
Well, it's possible.

270
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,040
But it would be very risky.

271
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,720
If it gets stuck,

272
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,120
it would take us three to four hours
to fix it.

273
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,160
Calculate the production rate increase.

274
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,840
Okay, Miss Nairobi.

275
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,400
Mr. Arturo.

276
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,960
Get up, Torres. God damn it, get up!

277
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,760
What are you doing?

278
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
None of your bussiness.
Act like I'm not here.

279
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,840
Walk to the door and don't lock it.

280
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,320
I'm sorry, but I'll have to report you.

281
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,560
If they find out I've seen you,
I'm done for too.

282
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
Look...

283
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,240
idiot!

284
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I have a gun.

285
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,160
Don't you dare report me

286
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,320
or you'll be the first to go.
Okay?

287
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Excuse me, Mr. Arturo,
but that's one of the fake guns.

288
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,600
You left the bag open.

289
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,400
Listen to me.

290
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,800
Listen because I won't say it again.

291
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
When all this is over,

292
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,040
and it will be in a couple of hours,
at best,

293
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
you're going to come back

294
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,840
to your crappy job.

295
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,960
And I'll be waiting for you the next day

296
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,760
with a fat layoff and a disciplinary file
that will make you shit yourself.

297
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,720
You'll be fucked up
until you retire.

298
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Okay?

299
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,040
You have three daughters, right?

300
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,760
And two of them
have been unemployed for...

301
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
seven years, if I recall correctly.

302
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
So it's up to you.

303
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,200
Torres.

304
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,520
-Miss Nairobi.
-What is it?

305
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,560
We would increase production
by two million every hour.

306
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
Do it.

307
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,920
And the technical stops
will be every six hours.

308
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,680
Because that's an extra two million.

309
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,840
Very well.

310
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,080
I'll get this off the ground.
Mark my words.

311
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
Anything troubling you?

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,920
No.

313
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm worried it's been the best night
of my life.

314
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,160
Salva.

315
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,160
You've already won me over,
no need to exaggerate.

316
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,240
It's true.

317
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
But I wasn't planning on it.
I hadn't anticipated it.

318
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Oh, you hadn't anticipated it?

319
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
Do you anticipate everything?

320
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Well, let's say...

321
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,640
I'm a man who...

322
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,760
picks out the clothes
he's going to wear the day before.

323
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
A man who became obsessed...

324
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,080
with...

325
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,840
making the best cider in the world.

326
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,560
And...

327
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,960
and I studied it all.

328
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,320
Acidity, fermentation...

329
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,600
Every possible reaction
of each ingredient.

330
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,840
Year...

331
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,440
after year, after year.

332
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
And you can get one bad apple...

333
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,440
that ruins the whole barrel.

334
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,720
Salva,
you're really into cider, aren't you?

335
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,200
It was my father's dream.

336
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,000
And...

337
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,400
he died before he could fulfill it.

338
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,080
He...

339
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,320
He wanted to make...

340
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,280
twenty four hundred barrels.

341
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,280
I understand the homage but...

342
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,720
Why don't you make half?

343
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
Or half of half,

344
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,680
and then...

345
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,520
focus on your own dreams?

346
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,440
Let's go away.

347
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,520
I wrap up this cider thing in a few days,

348
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,160
and we'll go to the Caribbean.

349
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,400
Well, I...

350
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,640
I don't have the cider,

351
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,280
but I have a mother, a daughter,

352
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,120
-and a heist to solve.
-Well, we take your mother...

353
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,880
and your daughter with us.

354
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Can you imagine raising your daughter
on a sunny beach?

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,960
Raquel...

356
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,920
I don't want this to wear off.

357
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,600
I don't want to ignore this...

358
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,520
this desire to feel alive
that I've never felt so strongly.

359
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,400
You would cross the ocean with a mother,

360
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,440
a daughter and a grandmother?

361
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,600
Right now, I would.

362
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
I have a plan B.

363
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Damn.

364
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,720
It's so crazy...

365
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,360
that...

366
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,280
I can't imagine myself
doing anything else.

367
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,120
Finish with the heist.
Do what you have to do.

368
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,240
And then we go.

369
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
Okay.

370
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,280
Okay.

371
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,720
Everyone listen up!

372
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,600
We're going to solve this heist
in 24 hours

373
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,560
and get back to our lives.
We've neglected them enough.

374
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Suarez.

375
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,440
Call Chief Sanchez.

376
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,080
I won't let anyone else get killed,
destroyed, or caught.

377
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,200
Nairobi, listen.
Coming as far as you have is epic.

378
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,800
I give you
my most sincere congratulations.

379
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,840
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>I'm going to get you out of there.</i>

380
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,680
Before they catch you all.

381
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,800
Get Lobo and the rest of the UCO here.

382
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,200
What do you have in mind?

383
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,720
I'm starting to think that
the man outside

384
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,120
is the real brains of the operation.

385
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,360
He drew a trail of clues
to lead us to the estate in Toledo.

386
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,160
But I think I know how to catch him.

387
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,000
First, we'll get the hostages
out of the basement.

388
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,360
Thank you. We don't have
enough people to guard the hostages.

389
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,240
Besides, we promised them freedom.
So let them have it.

390
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,960
We'll release them, but give me an hour.

391
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,720
It's a very big spectacle
for such a small audience.

392
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,160
Hi.

393
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm going to release 11 hostages,

394
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,080
<i>under one condition.</i>

395
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,720
I want a reporter and a camera
to cover the news from the inside.

396
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,040
<i>Live news feed.</i>

397
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,520
Look,

398
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
I'd love to help with your propaganda
but...

399
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,680
I can't force any civilian to go in there.

400
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,640
-<i> You know that very well.</i>
-True.

401
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,760
You're right, Inspector.

402
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,400
You don't have to force anyone.
Just suggest it. I'm sure

403
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,680
many reporters will volunteer
for an interview like that.

404
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,440
-I'll think about it.
<i>-Of course.</i>

405
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,920
Think about it.

406
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,080
But remember I record
these conversations and the last time

407
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,760
<i>you refused to release hostages...</i>

408
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,880
it wasn't taken very well by the public.

409
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,440
But, of course, take your time.

410
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,240
Son of a bitch.

411
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,240
Let's talk about something else.
How can I explain...

412
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,640
-Do you like soccer?
-Oh, yes, soccer.

413
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,080
Professor, in my country soccer is big.

414
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,400
Well, imagine a soccer match.

415
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,840
-Again with soccer?
-Nairobi, listen.

416
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,160
A match in the World Cup.

417
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
And Brazil is playing against Cameroon.

418
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,040
-Who wins?
-Easy!

419
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Or rather...

420
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,680
who do you want to win?

421
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,240
I'd say Brazil wins.

422
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,200
But I'd root for Cameroon.

423
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,080
-Cameroon.
-Yes.

424
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,320
Cameroon, for sure.

425
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,480
-Cameroon, all the way.
-Look,

426
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,040
by instinct, human beings always,

427
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,720
always sides with the weaker one.

428
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,680
The underdog.

429
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,040
So if we show the world our weaknesses,

430
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,600
our wounds,

431
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
that we are on the verge

432
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
of surrendering.

433
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,360
It will produce a...

434
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,720
a shudder.

435
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,640
I think any guy who isn't Brazilian
would go for Cameroon.

436
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
-Even some Brazilian guys.
-Or Brazilian girls.

437
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,920
Yes, or Brazilian girls.

438
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,960
Okay, gentlemen. To Cameroon!

439
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,120
How does that soccer chant go?

440
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,040
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

441
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

442
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,200
Cameroon!

443
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,960
We move on to plan Cameroon.

444
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,480
We'll release the hostages
in the basement.

445
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,720
And we're going to get a reporter
and a camera to record it.

446
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,760
We'll need someone to be interviewed.

447
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,920
And my suggestion

448
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,200
is you, Rio.

449
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,120
I understand your anger,

450
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,160
but we need you.
You can do it without a mask,

451
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
you're empathetic.

452
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,160
You think I'll go out on TV?

453
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,160
For Tokyo to see me from jail,

454
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,920
with a big smile,

455
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,120
doing an interview as if nothing
had fucking happened.

456
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,480
Now I'm a hostage.

457
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,720
Don't count on me for anything.

458
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,960
Fuck it, I'll do it.

459
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,560
I'm a natural crybaby,
you can tell just by looking.

460
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
You're no crybaby.
You make others cry.

461
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,080
I'll do it.

462
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,800
If I don't have to talk too much,
I'll do it.

463
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,760
You could, but no.

464
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,280
No.

465
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,360
I'll do it with a mask.

466
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,080
With a mask?

467
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,240
On a live interview?

468
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
What are we now?
ETA?

469
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,240
Jihadists?

470
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,640
No, no.

471
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,160
This interview has to be done

472
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,640
open-faced.

473
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,560
So all of Spain can feel our eyes,

474
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,360
our breath.
So that they can understand the pain

475
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,560
and a little bit of the sorrow.

476
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,240
Right.

477
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,400
You want to do it.

478
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,240
But you know what the problem is?

479
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,920
If there's someone
who I've never seen feel pain or sorrow

480
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,720
it's you, Berlin.

481
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,040
Tokyo's gone.

482
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,000
Rio doesn't want to do it.

483
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,680
Don't look down on someone
who's good at his job, Nairobi.

484
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,120
I can be a good master of ceremonies.

485
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,640
He's right.

486
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,360
He's good at acting.

487
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,120
Very well.

488
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,800
You'll do it.

489
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,560
HOSPITAL BLUEPRINTS
ENTRANCE

490
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,360
An interview in exchange
for releasing 11 hostages.

491
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,320
I don't know.

492
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,440
It's more justifiable.

493
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,360
We'll be criticized on every front,

494
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
but we have to accept it.

495
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Let's take the credit
and sell it as a display of transparency.

496
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
You can sell it however you like.
But what about the other thing?

497
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,600
The operation you want to set up
in the hospital.

498
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,240
In exchange for what?
On what evidence?

499
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
A plate of fresh anchovies?

500
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,280
On the evidence
that they have a guy outside

501
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,800
who keeps messing with us.

502
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,080
Angel caught him,
and they tried to kill him.

503
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,000
-It was no accident.
-Inspector, we all

504
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,520
read the forensic report
on the accident.

505
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,440
And there's no evidence
of an attempted homicide.

506
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,080
Don't forget he was driving
under the influence.

507
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,560
Fine. You want evidence?

508
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,240
Let's set up the operation.

509
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,560
Let me leak to the press that Angel,
the only one who knows who he is,

510
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,120
will wake up from his coma.
And I guarantee you,

511
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,880
before five in the afternoon,

512
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,680
he will be in the hospital to kill him.

513
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But we'll be there
to catch him like cat and mouse.

514
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,440
Are you asking me to fill a hospital

515
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,160
with undercover agents,
like some police comic strip?

516
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,000
We should focus our efforts
on the factory.

517
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,200
What about the reporters?

518
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,880
What if they end up hostages too?

519
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,760
That interview is a smokescreen.

520
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,560
A trick to make us waste time.

521
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,760
Chief. Let's, for once,

522
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,720
be the ones who set the trap.

523
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,000
Can't you do it with ten?

524
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,600
Twenty.

525
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,760
Monica Gaztambide,
you're up for treatment.

526
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,280
Let's go.

527
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,240
If you take off the jumpsuit,
maybe I can treat you.

528
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,240
Can you turn around?

529
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,960
Since we're not together anymore, right?

530
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,080
No problem.

531
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,640
Can I?

532
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,040
Wait.

533
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Now.

534
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
How's the wound?

535
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,720
It hurts a lot.

536
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
And it stings.

537
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,120
We'll get only one chance.
I want him alive.

538
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,880
No one fires unless under extreme danger.

539
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,320
First thing we'll do

540
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,840
is taking Angel to some place safe.

541
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,880
To do this, we'll set up a room
on a different floor.

542
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,480
Once we've moved him,
we'll leak the news of his recovery.

543
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,720
And the target will soon be on the move.

544
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,320
It will bw essential
that everyone is in position.

545
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,760
<i>I want everyone</i>
<i>to get deep into their role.</i>

546
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,520
This is a very complex operation,

547
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,280
so we'll need extreme concentration.

548
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,720
<i>We'll have access</i>
<i>to the surveillance cameras.</i>

549
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,880
I don't want anyone from security
on the floor.

550
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,400
Not even hospital security.

551
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
No police cars in the vicinity either.

552
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,320
We'll roll out the fucking red carpet
into Angel's room,

553
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,640
where Lobo will be waiting instead.

554
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,480
And agent Balmaseda
will take Mari Carmen's place.

555
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,360
They'll be there,
ready for a welcome surprise.

556
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,320
And remember,
we're looking for a middle-aged male.

557
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,720
You'll be 20 agents and he'll be alone.

558
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,520
He won't escape.

559
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,920
Did you do it?

560
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,040
It's loaded!

561
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,960
It's loaded.

562
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,240
Stop packing the bills
and stash what you can.

563
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,920
We're out of here!

564
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Stash them.

565
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,480
Quick!

566
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,960
We're going now. This has lasted too long.

567
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,160
Piece of crap.

568
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,840
Let's go.

569
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,720
Fifth day of the heist.

570
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,000
<i>One hostage</i>
<i>and two officers wounded,</i>

571
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,720
<i>an explosion,</i>

572
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,480
<i>hostages escaped,</i>

573
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>and now Channel 6 cameras</i>
<i>are about to enter the place</i>

574
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,680
<i>that the whole world is watching.</i>

575
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,600
<i>Reporters heading for the entrance.</i>

576
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,960
<i>We must remember the historical impact</i>

577
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,440
<i>of this moment.</i>

578
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,280
<i>TV channels from all over</i>
<i>the world are broadcasting our signal...</i>

579
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,440
Cover them until securing entry.

580
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,720
<i>...the first time a TV crew</i>
<i>goes live on...</i>

581
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,120
<i>They're opening the doors.</i>
<i>Attention escorts,</i>

582
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,000
stop at the bottom of the stairs
as requested.

583
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,680
<i>...special at the Royal Mint of Spain.</i>
<i>A crucial moment.</i>

584
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,000
<i>In a minute,</i>
<i>we'll witness something historic</i>

585
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,280
<i>A Channel 6 reporter and cameraman</i>
<i>will enter the site of the heist.</i>

586
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,280
<i>This is as far as the police can go.</i>
<i>From this point on</i>

587
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,800
<i>the reporters will be on their own,</i>
<i>unprotected.</i>

588
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,000
<i>We've never seen such a thing.</i>
<i>All over the country, streets are empty.</i>

589
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,760
Return to your posts.

590
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,040
Good morning.

591
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,320
-Good morning.
-I'm Andres de Fonollosa.

592
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,120
Thank you for being here.

593
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,840
Can you put this on, please?

594
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,560
<i>We're already receiving the signal.</i>
<i>We're going live...</i>

595
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,800
-Raquel.
<i>-...inside the factory.</i>

596
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,520
<i>Mr. Fonollosa, I have to ask</i>
<i>why did you allow a team of journalists</i>

597
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,720
<i>to broadcast live from here.</i>

598
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,520
<i>This is a decisive moment</i>
<i>for all of us in here and...</i>

599
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,720
we needed you here
to record it and to make it public.

600
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,840
Please, come with me. This way.

601
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,120
<i>That's Andres de Fonollosa,</i>

602
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,920
<i>a familiar face to the police.</i>

603
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,560
<i>Bank robber, informer, and</i>
<i>convicted for human trafficking.</i>

604
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,960
These are the 11 hostages

605
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,760
that are going to be released.

606
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
There they are.

607
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
I recognize

608
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,200
Manuel García,

609
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Alfonso Martínez,

610
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
and María Cornejo.

611
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,280
Looks like they will let them go.

612
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,640
<i>We're all nervous...</i>

613
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,160
Medical services ready.

614
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,240
<i>...like kids waiting</i>
<i>for the school bell to ring.</i>

615
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,960
I want to thank you all.

616
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
For the courage and bravery...

617
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,640
you have shown.

618
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,440
And...

619
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,000
and you, especially.

620
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,480
You and your child.

621
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,440
You've proven 
to be a strong woman.

622
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,240
Why have you decided

623
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,440
now,

624
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,840
after five days of captivity,

625
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,680
<i>to release hostages?</i>

626
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,920
<i>Five days?</i>

627
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,960
<i>It's hard to believe it's been</i>

628
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,240
a few days, isn't it?

629
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,880
You see...

630
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,560
We confess
that this is a very hard time for us.

631
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,360
<i>The situation is critical.</i>

632
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,920
<i>We have no other option but to surrender.</i>

633
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,760
<i>That's why you're here.</i>

634
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,440
This gesture is the beginning
of the end for everyone.

635
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,240
Helsinki,

636
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,800
it's time.

637
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,520
You can go.

638
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,840
Thank you.

639
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,280
Snipers ready.

640
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,520
Assault Team 1, keep your distance.

641
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,800
Copy that.

642
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,680
We'll release hostages
in order to negociate

643
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,680
the conditions for our surrender.

644
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,800
<i>Have you decided to surrender?</i>

645
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,280
<i>We are aware that we lost.</i>

646
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,160
Open the doors!

647
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,680
<i>Eleven released. We're watching it live..</i>

648
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,920
They're coming out.

649
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,880
<i>At last, good news at the Mint Factory.</i>

650
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,640
<i>There they are.</i>

651
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,840
<i>It's an exciting moment.</i>
<i>It seems like the heist men are giving in.</i>

652
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,640
<i>But there are more headlines, big ones.</i>

653
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,200
<i>Fonollosa has admitted that</i>
<i>the situation is critical,</i>

654
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,720
<i>that they have no alternative</i>
<i>but to surrender.</i>

655
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,320
<i>His literal words were:</i>

656
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
<i>"This is the beginning of the end,</i>

657
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,320
<i>and we are aware that we lost".</i>

658
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
I don't know if you've ever seen a corpse.

659
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,960
For some of us it's also a first.

660
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,480
<i>You've come here to tell the truth.</i>

661
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,840
<i>Here it is. This is the truth.</i>

662
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,920
<i>We've been beaten.</i>

663
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,360
<i>We've been defeated.</i>

664
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,920
<i>It's important that you confirm it,</i>

665
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,200
<i>please.</i>

666
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,760
<i>Yes.</i>

667
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,880
<i>He doesn't have a pulse. He's dead.</i>

668
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,240
The hostages who escaped
hit him in the head.

669
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,560
He died within a few hours.

670
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Maybe to the people out there,

671
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,480
this man is just a thief.

672
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,000
But to us,
he was a companion and a friend.

673
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,960
Nobody prepares you for that.

674
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,880
Nobody.
It's one of the reasons why

675
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,480
<i>we decided to release hostages.</i>

676
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,680
<i>Some of us here thought</i>
<i>we weren't going to make it out alive.</i>

677
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,520
<i>But I never thought it would be him.</i>

678
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,840
You mean,
there were people in the group...

679
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,840
willing to sacrifice themselves?

680
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,200
No.

681
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
No.

682
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,720
Not at all. We're simple people.

683
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,840
We have gone through hardship

684
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,800
of all kinds.

685
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,360
Like anyone else.

686
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,080
Including terminal illness.
And we have had to

687
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,320
take desperate actions like these
in order to

688
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,360
leave something for our families.

689
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,640
For our loved ones.

690
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,200
As a matter of fact,

691
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,880
I have a degenerative disease
called Hellmer's myopathy.

692
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,160
The police knew it.

693
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,720
<i>That didn't stop them</i>
<i>from spreading lies about me.</i>

694
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,320
<i>I'll tell you something,</i>
<i>I may be a thief...</i>

695
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,280
<i>I have always been.</i>
<i>I've robbed banks, jewelry stores,</i>

696
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,000
<i>I've broken into mansions.</i>
<i>But I have never sold anyone.</i>

697
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,320
I've never sold a woman.

698
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,160
I'm not a pimp

699
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,000
who traffics.

700
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,480
Or rapes minors.

701
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,520
I'm not.

702
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,720
Ask the police, when you leave,
in which files are these cases.

703
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,600
You mean the police have lied
to the public?

704
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,800
The police lie!

705
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,640
They lie to the public!

706
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,480
They've lied to my friends.

707
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,720
They've soiled my family name.

708
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,760
I'm a thief.

709
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,800
But I have every right
in the world not to be defamed.

710
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,160
I have the same right as anyone

711
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,000
to die in peace.

712
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,920
With dignity.

713
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,560
I can't go on. Cut.

714
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,840
Please, cut.

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,160
<i>That morning we were</i>
<i>a trending topic worldwide.</i>

716
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,960
<i>People went silent</i>

717
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,520
<i>in cafeterias and in taxis.</i>

718
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,720
<i>Fonollosa says the police are lying.</i>

719
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,360
That they have been lying about his past.

720
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,920
<i>And dares them to come up</i>
<i>with legal files.</i>

721
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,160
<i>We were the Cameroon team</i>
<i>barefoot against Brazil.</i>

722
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,440
<i>And everyone was rooting for us.</i>

723
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,640
<i>We're now going to our news colleagues,</i>
<i>Cristina Saavedra. Go ahead.</i>

724
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,240
<i>Breaking news:</i>
<i>Deputy Inspector Ángel Rubio</i>

725
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,680
<i>could wake from his coma.</i>

726
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,720
<i>He was kept in an induced coma</i>
<i>after a car accident.</i>

727
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,640
<i>The Deputy Inspector</i>
<i>suffered an accident on road M-506</i>

728
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,320
<i>when his car crashed</i>
<i>into a construction booth</i>

729
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,240
<i>in one of the lanes, causing it</i>
<i>to roll over multiple times.</i>

730
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,000
Professor,

731
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,280
<i>did you see us on TV?</i>

732
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,680
Nairobi, I want you all to be one,
like a rowing team.

733
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,000
Tell Rio that, as captain of the ship,

734
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,120
I'll get Tokyo out of jail
no matter what.

735
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,880
Yes, sir. That's more like it!

736
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,200
Put Berlin on.

737
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,480
Berlin.

738
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,600
Me?

739
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,400
Yes, you.

740
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,240
Thank you.

741
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,520
Hello?

742
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,840
Deputy Inspector Rubio
is waking from his coma.

743
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,520
What are the odds of that being true?

744
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,920
I don't know.

745
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,600
That's elementary police work:

746
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,480
saying he's waking from his coma
to lure you in.

747
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,160
That doesn't even work on sitcoms.

748
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,600
And what if it's not?

749
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,040
He's the only one who knows who I am.
The only loose end.

750
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,680
What room did they put him in?

751
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,560
<i>Room 119.</i>

752
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,400
It's a trap.

753
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,840
Yes.

754
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,840
There's a 90 per cent chance it's a trap.

755
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,920
<i>Ninety nine percent chance.</i>

756
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,040
Ninety nine percent.

757
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,920
But are we going to leave
one percent to chance?

758
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,880
No, you'll have to make sure.
And if it isn't a trap,

759
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,760
<i>finish him off.</i>

760
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,040
Enter a hospital

761
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,080
in which, surely, there'll be
50 police officers waiting for me?

762
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,760
<i>Sergio, think, damn it.</i>

763
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,720
You spent half your childhood
in a hospital.

764
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,040
How do you walk into a trap
and not get caught,

765
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,400
<i>knowing that the cavalry</i>
<i>is waiting for you?</i>

766
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,480
That would be

767
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,600
by making the cavalry

768
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,960
run away.

769
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,000
