1
00:00:00,664 --> 00:00:02,578
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,168
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,510
I returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:07,772
to save my city.

5
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:10,245
But my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:12,547
I had to become
someone else.

7
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:15,450
I had to become
something else.

8
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:18,720
I had to become
the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:20,088
Previously, on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,757
So, when are you
gonna pop the question?

11
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,559
Tonight.

12
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,561
This is a map of
Lian Yu.

13
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:29,631
I think that it leads
to whatever Reiter is looking for.

14
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:30,765
To get there,
I'll need your help.

15
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,767
The restoration
of Starling Bay.

16
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:33,902
Leave the Bay
as it is.

17
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:34,936
What if I refuse?

18
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:36,538
The fight to save
Star City

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,139
isn't going to be fought
in the shadows.

20
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,574
It's gonna be fought
in the light of day.

21
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:41,776
And I promise you that
I will never stop fighting

22
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,545
to save this city.

23
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:45,547
There was a time I would
have thought this was my fault.

24
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:48,617
It's not my fault.
It's my responsibility.

25
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:59,628
Ollie.

26
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,630
Hey. How we doing?

27
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:03,765
It's actually
a pretty great turnout.

28
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:05,667
Who knew people would
rather pick up garbage

29
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:07,235
than celebrate
the holidays, huh?

30
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,404
Not bad for a hippie,
crunchy campaign proposal, huh?

31
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,139
Nobody likes an
"I told you so."

32
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:12,474
Accept apparently
Star City.

33
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:14,209
Your approval rating
is up 10 points.

34
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:15,477
I have an approval rating.

35
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:16,645
Yes. Yes, you do.

36
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,574
Welcome to politics,
Mr. Queen.

37
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:19,298
Mr. Queen.

38
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:21,150
Yes. Excuse me.

39
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:23,184
How do you feel
about inspiring

40
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:24,919
so many people to
come out here today?

41
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:27,155
Oh, I didn't inspire
anyone.

42
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:29,758
This is the city that I know,
it's the city I remember,

43
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,459
and it's the city
that we can be again.

44
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,627
Nice. Thank you
for your time.

45
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:33,300
Thank you.

46
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:34,764
Nice line.

47
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:37,132
Wish you'd given him
that one?

48
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,667
I might have given
a note or two.

49
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:40,435
Well, you've got
people picking up garbage

50
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:42,103
when they should be
picking up presents.

51
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:43,304
I think you missed
your calling.

52
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:44,906
How are you doing?

53
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:47,375
I have my brother home
with me for the holidays, Oliver.

54
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:50,311
He's in a cage,
but he's here.

55
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:53,715
We're gonna get Andy
out from under Darhk's influence, John.

56
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:55,784
That is a promise.

57
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:59,187
If we can reduce just
40% of the toxicity

58
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,189
that's produced by
the bacterial micro-organisms

59
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,524
that have just
sprung up here--

60
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:03,958
We can swim in just
12 more days

61
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,161
if the restitution rates
stays consistent.

62
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:07,162
Yes.

63
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,129
She's like a mini you.

64
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,952
So cute.

65
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:09,765
That's awesome.

66
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,702
Everybody get down!

67
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,271
Get down!

68
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:17,572
Come on, let's go.

69
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:18,840
Go!

70
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,075
Go, go. Get down!

71
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:22,110
Whoa!

72
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:24,679
I think I can power
the drones down remotely.

73
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:26,281
I think now would be
a good time for that.

74
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:28,249
Go!

75
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:33,421
Hurry!

76
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,258
Get down!

77
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:48,737
You all right?

78
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:55,184

80
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:04,119
A day of hope for
a better tomorrow

81
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:07,222
has turned into another day
of despair for Star City.

82
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:10,592
A terrorist attack has left
dozens in critical condition

83
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:13,995
after people showed up to help
Oliver Queen and his campaign staff

84
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:15,930
clean up the Star City Bay.

85
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:18,800
In the meantime, SCPD
and national authorities

86
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:21,035
are searching for
the individuals responsible,

87
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:24,906
but so far,
there are no suspects.

88
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,775
Any news on the victims?

89
00:03:26,777 --> 00:03:29,244
Some are being released,
some are still in surgery.

90
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:30,779
It's a miracle
that no one died.

91
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,380
Despite Darhk's
best efforts.

92
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,482
Are we sure that
this was HIVE?

93
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,087
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

94
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,455
Are you ok?

95
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:43,057
There were kids there.

96
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,646
It's Alex.

97
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,561
He's saying that
every news network

98
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:48,463
in the country is looking for
a comment from you.

99
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,898
No comment.

100
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,933
Ollie, we have to
give them something.

101
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,268
What do you want me
to say?

102
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,435
I asked people
to come and help,

103
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:55,904
they almost died
because of it.

104
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:59,607
It's--when we have
a plan to get Darhk,

105
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,309
then I will talk
to the press.

106
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:03,077
I know HIVE wants
this city to die,

107
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,613
but going after
a volunteer event,

108
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:08,149
it just seems
a little overkill.

109
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:11,252
Two weeks ago Darhk told me
to back off my plan to clean up the Bay.

110
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:12,921
Today he went after
civilians.

111
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:15,757
This is important to him
for some reason.

112
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,492
We need to understand
what it is.

113
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:20,094
Last time I tried to
talk to my brother,

114
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:21,296
it didn't go
too well.

115
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,964
Try to talk to him
again.

116
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:26,734
A couple of weeks in a cage
will change your perspective.

117
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:29,270
Trust me.

118
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:32,907
All right, almost there.
Maybe two more miles.

119
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,476
Since when does two more miles
mean almost there?

120
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,712
Taiana, we need
to push forward.

121
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:39,914
No. That's what
you want.

122
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,150
My brother's dead and you have me
marching to the sea.

123
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:43,985
I thought that you wanted
to get back at Reiter.

124
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:46,821
I want to kill the bastards who
killed my brother.

125
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:49,958
Conklin is just
an extension of Reiter.

126
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,723
You want to hurt them,

127
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,747
you keep them from
getting what they want.

128
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,663
Your idea of revenge
is a bit more indirect than mine.

129
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:58,600
You're right.
I'm using you.

130
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:01,336
You said you were a dive instructor.
I need those skills.

131
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:04,172
But I'm promising you,
if I get what I want,

132
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:07,075
Reiter and Conklin
will suffer.

133
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:09,878
What would Vlad
want you to do?

134
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,621
My friends seem to
think you're ready to talk.

135
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,589
But I know better.

136
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:26,928
You were always
one stubborn son of a bitch.

137
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:33,368
Pictures of Carly
and Andy Jr.

138
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,939
A real man would
have asked for them by now.

139
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:41,109
You know Carly cried
for months

140
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,710
because she thought
you were killed.

141
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:45,613
Andy Jr. grew up
without a father.

142
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,949
And you let them.

143
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,585
It wasn't me.
It was HIVE.

144
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,553
They fake our deaths
so we're untraceable.

145
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:55,423
Floyd Lawton shot me
with ammo supplied by HIVE.

146
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,225
He didn't even know.

147
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:58,760
But you destroyed
your family, Andy.

148
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:00,395
And you never
reached out to them.

149
00:06:00,397 --> 00:06:01,896
Not even once.

150
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:04,666
How could you
do that?

151
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:09,170
I get it. You didn't care then,
you don't care now.

152
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:12,307
Just so you know,

153
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,943
your good friend
Damien Darhk

154
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,978
attacked the Star City Bay
this morning.

155
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,180
Hurt a whole lot
of people.

156
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:20,331
And the neuro-blockers

157
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,251
he was using on you are
no longer in your system.

158
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:25,653
So chemically speaking,
Andy, you're no longer his bitch.

159
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:27,789
I'm not anyone's bitch.

160
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,092
And I'm not yours.

161
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:33,428
What happened to you, Andy?

162
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,998
If Damien Darhk
brainwashed you,

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,533
I could get it.

164
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:41,069
But according to Darhk,

165
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:44,405
were you running drugs
and weapons in the Stan?

166
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:47,508
I had to do what
I had to do.

167
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,844
I'm giving you
a chance here, man.

168
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,980
A chance, Andy,
to redeem yourself

169
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:53,548
for all that
you've done.

170
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,984
I have to believe that some place
deep inside of you

171
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,052
you want to make
the right choice.

172
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:02,156
So I'm asking whatever's left of
the brother I love,

173
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:04,058
the one I still love,
Andy,

174
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,193
one last time, man,

175
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:07,996
what does Darhk want
with the bay?

176
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,299
I don't know.

177
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,607
Hey, mom.

178
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,376
Thank God you're ok,
baby.

179
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,411
Yeah, I'm ok.
I'm fine.

180
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:25,279
Ohh, it's so awful.

181
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,350
It's like who shoots up
a bunch of people during the holidays?

182
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,652
That's what makes it
awful?

183
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:33,855
Why does it look like Santa Claus
threw up in here?

184
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:36,691
It's for
Oliver's campaign holiday party.

185
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:40,862
I wanted to make sure
your Jewish heritage was represented.

186
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:43,031
Yeah, not so sure
that's still gonna be happening.

187
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,332
What? Humbug.

188
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,501
No, no, no.
That's ridiculous, sweetie.

189
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:48,169
No, you can't let
the terrorists win.

190
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,505
I'm gonna go take
a shower.

191
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:52,907
Ok.

192
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,545
Mom! Mom! Are you ok?
Are you ok?

193
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:58,679
Are you ok?
I...

194
00:07:58,681 --> 00:07:59,947
In the Christmas lights...
Uh-huh.

195
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,582
In a ring box.

196
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,151
I found this.

197
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:04,552
Mmm.

198
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:05,920
3 carats, Princess cut.

199
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:07,522
No cloudiness at all.

200
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:10,358
I knew Oliver loved you,
but not this much.

201
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,727
He's gonna propose.

202
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,028
Oh!

203
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,464
He's gonna propose.
Oh, my gosh.

204
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,933
Oh, honey, I don't know
who's more excited, you or me.

205
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,270
Ahh.

206
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:34,482
Thanks for coming.

207
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:37,885
I've been trying to
figure out how to deal with them.

208
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,588
Sort of think our best bet is
telling the truth.

209
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,023
It's the only play
we got, man.

210
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,225
The HIVE has us
outnumbered.

211
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:45,560
If we have any
chance of stopping Darhk,

212
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:47,462
we need to ask
the city for help.

213
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:50,231
If we do this,
it's going to paint a target

214
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,732
on all of our backs.

215
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:52,800
We can take care
of ourselves.

216
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,602
Let's light them up.

217
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:05,746
Thank you for coming, everyone.
Thank you.

218
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,615
As today's tragedy
has reminded us,

219
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:09,383
we are at war.

220
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:13,621
For 6 months, we have been besieged
by a nameless

221
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:15,823
and a faceless
organization

222
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:18,493
that seems hell bent
on destroying our city.

223
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:19,961
You know them as
the Ghosts.

224
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:21,629
And while they
may be anonymous,

225
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,131
their leader is not.

226
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,066
He has a face,
he has a name,

227
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:26,634
and I think that
it is high time

228
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:30,338
the people of Star City
know the truth about who he is.

229
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,375
His name is Damien Darhk.

230
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:36,524
He controls the Ghosts
on behalf

231
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:38,480
of an organization
known as HIVE.

232
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:41,349
HIVE wants this city
to die.

233
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:42,984
Now, I will be
distributing this,

234
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:45,052
the only known
photograph or Mr. Darhk,

235
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:48,089
to every news outlet
and social media feed in the country.

236
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:52,126
For months, this man has made us
afraid to walk the streets.

237
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:54,128
I suggest that we
return the favor.

238
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,164
We will also be
setting up a hotline.

239
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,267
Now, individually, Mr. Darhk
may be able to defeat us,

240
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,871
but united, he doesn't
stand a chance.

241
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,477
Congratulations, Damien.
You're famous.

242
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:22,099
Well, that should get
his attention at the very least.

243
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:23,270
You good with the hotline?

244
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:24,244
I'm on it.

245
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,745
All right.

246
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:26,946
Happy hunting.

247
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:28,881
That is a whole lot
of Hanukah.

248
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:31,217
Yeah, for your campaign
holiday party.

249
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:34,453
You better believe that my faith
is going to be well represented.

250
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:38,257
Felicity, ahem, we just waved
a red flag in front a bull.

251
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,393
That doesn't mean
the bull is gonna charge right away.

252
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:43,129
And it doesn't mean we can put our
entire lives on hold in the meantime.

253
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:45,565
But--help me out here, man.

254
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,638
Can't do. Can't throw a grenade
and then go to ground.

255
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,577
John is right.

256
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,140
As much as your speech
was about outing Darhk,

257
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:54,440
it was also about sending the message
that you're not afraid anymore.

258
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:55,808
And canceling your
Christmas party--

259
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,643
Holiday.
Holiday.

260
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:02,515
Your holiday party is sending
the opposite message.

261
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:08,187
Ok. Talk to Lance, see if he can get
some extra security

262
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,623
for this holiday party.

263
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:22,134
Can I ask you a question?

264
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,170
Now? Here?

265
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:28,040
I mean, what's
the question?

266
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,810
Did we do the right thing?

267
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:33,679
You mean with Darhk?

268
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:40,620
Yeah. He's gonna retaliate
somewhere, someplace.

269
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:43,656
When he does,
we'll be ready.

270
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,629
I think the drugs Reiter has you and
the other captives growing

271
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,297
is just funding
his bigger plan.

272
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,699
Searching for some sort
of mystical artifact.

273
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:55,568
He likes his prayers
and trinkets.

274
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,069
And maps.

275
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:58,504
But I cannot make that one

276
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:00,539
without detailed
survey maps of the island.

277
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,607
Reiter doesn't
have them?

278
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:02,708
Not that I've seen.

279
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,176
But Reiter is not
the first person

280
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:07,213
to come to this island while
I've been here.

281
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,287
If you're here to give me
a Christmas present,

282
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:18,858
you can keep whatever knife
or torture device you plan on giving me.

283
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,694
No presents.
Nothing gift-wrapped at any rate.

284
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:25,264
I just wanted to
check and see how you're feeling.

285
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,666
I'm great.

286
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,701
Haven't wanted to snap
anybody's neck

287
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,069
who's given me
the wrong look

288
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,938
since Damien Darhk
whammied me.

289
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,741
I think I might
be cured, Dad.

290
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:40,112
So you can keep whatever file
you have on a pedophile

291
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:42,715
or meter maid
or politician,

292
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,651
whoever it is that
you think I'm gonna kill.

293
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:48,521
Since you told me about
your encounter with Damien Darhk,

294
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:50,589
I had my minions
looking into it.

295
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:51,924
You love having minions.

296
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:53,826
Darhk's affect on you
had nothing to do

297
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:56,295
with his exposure
to waters from the Lazarus Pit.

298
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,297
Then why do you think
he's affecting my bloodlust?

299
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,932
I don't know.

300
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:01,600
There are very few things in this world
that scare me, Thea,

301
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:03,502
but I'm beginning
to suspect

302
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,905
we're dealing with something
that might fall into that category.

303
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:09,108
Cheer up, Dad.
Ok? It's Christmas.

304
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,043
We are dealing with
universal forces

305
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:12,378
that I don't
understand yet.

306
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,613
Please promise me
that you will be careful.

307
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:17,550
I pinky promise.

308
00:13:36,304 --> 00:13:38,838
You were not kidding
about the extra security.

309
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,972
Where did you find
all these guys?

310
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:41,440
A friend of mine
is a SEAL.

311
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,075
He knows someone who
knew someone who knew someone.

312
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:44,076
Really big
somebodies.

313
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,111
These guys are
like 3 of me.

314
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:46,579
Yeah. Where's Laurel?

315
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:48,347
Probably fielding
a million calls on the hotline.

316
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:49,715
She must love you
right now.

317
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:51,083
Is it just me

318
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:53,156
or did you hire the us army
as your caterers?

319
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:54,857
Actually, they're marines.

320
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,558
I am John Diggle.
I work security for Mr. Queen.

321
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,061
Curtis Holt, I work for
Mr. Queen's girlfriend.

322
00:13:59,063 --> 00:13:59,805
This is my husband Paul.

323
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:00,864
Wow. A hottie.

324
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,831
Nice work,
Curtis.

325
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,633
What, was--wait,
was that weird?

326
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,214
A little.

327
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:05,869
Don't worry,

328
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,169
you're handsome,
duh,

329
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:08,237
but you bat for
the other team

330
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,305
and I'm practically
engaged.

331
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,372
And by practically
engaged,

332
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,341
I mean not engaged
at all.

333
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,376
Right? I mean,
anything can happen eventually.

334
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:17,079
In like years.
In another galaxy.

335
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,914
Excuse me, can I steal
you for a second?

336
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,216
The fire department
chief's here.

337
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:23,552
Very nice to meet
you. Curtis.

338
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,888
Oliver.

339
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,189
How long have you
two been married?

340
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:28,324
5 years right about now.

341
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,192
Oh, a winter
wedding.

342
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:31,327
It must have been
beautiful.

343
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,561
It was the summer,
actually.

344
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,229
We got married on
a scuba diving boat

345
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:35,731
near the Great Barrier Reef.

346
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,067
I hid the ring in a seashell
at the bottom of the reef.

347
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,234
And you are lucky
I found it.

348
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,736
Well, you never
would have found it

349
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:42,671
if I had put it in a dessert
like straight people do.

350
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,807
Have you seen him
eat a piece of cake?

351
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,375
He doesn't chew, he inhales.

352
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:47,476
Souffle.

353
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:49,912
Felicity, are you ok?

354
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:52,081
Yeah, just got to
find my mom.

355
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,091
Mom?

356
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:02,562
Oh.

357
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:03,460
Ahh.

358
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:07,129
Uh, I am never gonna be
able to unsee this.

359
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,098
Sorry, honey.

360
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,435
Um, sweetie, I would like you to meet
my boyfriend, Quentin.

361
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:15,504
She's your mother?
He's your boyfriend?

362
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,605
What?

363
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:18,040
Did you say
"boyfriend"?

364
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,942
I'm sorry, do--do you
guys know each other?

365
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,744
I thought it was
just like a date or something.

366
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,279
Can--can--can I talk
to my mom?

367
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:26,081
For a second.

368
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,649
Oh, yeah.

369
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,985
Listen, um, Laurel
doesn't know.

370
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:31,620
Yeah, I'm gonna hit myself
over the head

371
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:34,590
with something very heavy
so that I don't know either.

372
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:36,191
All right.
Yeah, ok.

373
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:39,762
Bye.

374
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,264
Ahh!
Isn't Quentin amazing?

375
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,133
Oh, my gosh!

376
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:45,801
Oliver was gonna propose
to me 3 months ago.

377
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:46,969
What?

378
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:48,437
3 months ago.

379
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:49,133
How do you know?

380
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,073
It's a long story,

381
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,674
but he was gonna propose,
and then we moved back here.

382
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:54,009
So why didn't he just
pop the question

383
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:55,344
once you settled
back in?

384
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:03,786
Yes?

385
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:04,596
Never mind.

386
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,352
What? Excuse me.

387
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,423
Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey.

388
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,545
What's going on?

389
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:09,292
I don't know.

390
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:09,906
Is it Darhk?

391
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,960
In as much as he's the reason

392
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:13,929
that Laurel and Thea showed up
on our doorstep 3 months ago

393
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,831
right before you were
going to propose.

394
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,299
And before you say
anything, you should know

395
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,802
that my mom found the ring
in the decorations box.

396
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:20,836
It's not what you think.

397
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:22,304
That depends on
whether or not

398
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:23,806
you think that I think
that you were gonna propose

399
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,541
and then that you
changed your mind.

400
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:26,403
I didn't change my mind.

401
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:27,277
Well, something changed.

402
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,546
Everything changed.
Where we live,

403
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:32,948
what we do, who we are.
We...

404
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,484
I was gonna propose.

405
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:35,452
Oh.

406
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,053
But then we came back
to Star City

407
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:40,989
and I just needed some
time to rethink things.

408
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:43,425
Because you thought
I wasn't gonna say yes?

409
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:47,296
No, because what we're
doing is dangerous. And I--

410
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,465
But I chose this life
and I chose you.

411
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,667
And I don't understand
why we can't have both.

412
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:52,901
Well--

413
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:07,516
Mmm. Mmm.

414
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:09,017
Malbec. Nice.

415
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,719
How did you know that
was my favorite red?

416
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:13,689
So full bodied,
so full of life.

417
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:15,324
Unlike your security
outside.

418
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:19,695
Oh, and in my defense,
they fired first.

419
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,930
I guess my invitation
was lost in the mail.

420
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:23,732
I'm only kidding.

421
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:25,801
It's not my
kind of scene anyway.

422
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:30,539
Hmm. I'm only here to have a word
with the man of the hour.

423
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,241
What do you want?

424
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:35,611
Well, something I
can't have, apparently.

425
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:38,547
Your loyalty,
your allegiance.

426
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,950
I told you there would be
a price to pay if you refused.

427
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:45,154
I made that decision,
not these people.

428
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:46,788
Let them go.

429
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,525
Oh, I wish I could do that.
I really do.

430
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,327
But sometimes the best
way to teach someone a lesson

431
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:53,438
isn't to punish them,

432
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:55,462
it's to punish the ones
he cares about the most.

433
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,777
Take them.

434
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:24,172
Oliver. Oliver,
they took her.

435
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,541
They took my baby girl.

436
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:27,976
Please.
It's ok.

437
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:29,844
It's all right.
It's ok.

438
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:30,979
I'll get her back.

439
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:35,150
They took Thea, too.

440
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:38,019
All right,
she's gonna be ok.

441
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,154
What happened?

442
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:40,622
It was all over
before it started.

443
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:42,457
John and Thea, they didn't
stand a chance.

444
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:43,892
And I couldn't make a move
because then Darhk would know

445
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:45,326
that I was playing
for your side.

446
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:46,794
And I'm not sure
that was the right call.

447
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,696
You made the right call.
We need to track Darhk.

448
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:50,965
You need to dig up
everything that you can find, ok?

449
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,134
Yeah, I'm on it.
Alex.

450
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:54,969
Police are gonna want to ask you
about what happened.

451
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:56,838
Take care of these people.
Get them home if they need it.

452
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,540
Get them medical attention
if they need it.

453
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,308
And pay for it out of
the campaign fund.

454
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,010
Of course. What
about the police?

455
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,244
Stall the police.

456
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:14,222
Tell me where to find
Damien Darhk.

457
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:19,694
Where is Damien Darhk?

458
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:22,864
Oliver, we'll find them.

459
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:25,400
Not even the Ghosts
know where they are.

460
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,702
Did you learn anything
from the hotline?

461
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:31,940
Only how many crazy/bored
people there are in the city.

462
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:35,410
Don't go there.
Where?

463
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,078
Your go-to place.

464
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,847
Where you sit there
and you say that it's all your fault.

465
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,916
Well, it is my fault.
I'm the one who outed Darhk.

466
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:44,886
I know. I seem to remember us
all being there when you did.

467
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:46,754
I ran for mayor because
I can protect myself

468
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,389
and I thought that all
of you could, too.

469
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,225
And you were right,
we can.

470
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:52,560
I know, but you didn't
sign up for this.

471
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:54,529
Oliver, we can take care
of ourselves.

472
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:58,132
And that's including
Felicity.

473
00:19:58,134 --> 00:19:59,400
You inspired a lot
of people.

474
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:01,536
Well, Thea and John
and Felicity,

475
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:04,005
inspiration is not what
they need tonight.

476
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:13,314
But somewhere, someplace
there is a Ghost that's gonna talk to me.

477
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:15,450
What if there isn't?

478
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:19,887
I'm going to take great pleasure in
trying to make them.

479
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,857
Are you ready?

480
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:25,026
I hope so.

481
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:28,263
I don't see how you can free dive
 after only an hour's instruction.

482
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:29,199
Well, since coming
to this island,

483
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,463
I've learned I can do
a lot of things

484
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:31,347
that I didn't think
I could.

485
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:32,190
Plus, you're a good teacher.

486
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,039
I could go with you.

487
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,018
I know the ship.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

488
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,833
All right, I want every uniform
canvassing leads.

489
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,036
I want every detective talking to
every CO we got. You get it?

490
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,372
Hey, baby,
what's--what's going on?

491
00:20:57,374 --> 00:20:58,873
Something happened?

492
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,610
Got a message
from the office.

493
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,010
A tip came
through the hotline.

494
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,311
Yeah? Something we can
move on?

495
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:06,048
About you.

496
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,285
Come here.

497
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,759
Are you working for
Damien Darhk?

498
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:19,461
It's not what you think.

499
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:20,996
You don't know
what I think.

500
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:22,364
Darhk threatened you, ok?

501
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,200
I did what I had to do
to keep you safe, honey.

502
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,635
Oh, really?
And what's that, Dad?

503
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:27,903
How many people died?

504
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,038
How many fathers'
daughters?

505
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,473
None, I hope.
None, I...

506
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:34,042
I just--I just been
eyes and ears, all right?

507
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,611
First for Darhk, and then
for the past month or so...

508
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,280
Oliver.

509
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:40,248
Oliver knew about this?

510
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,017
Yeah, he found out.
Didn't take it too well at first,

511
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,286
but then I think
he understood.

512
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:46,088
Understood what?

513
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,292
That there was nothing
I wouldn't do to protect my baby girl.

514
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:57,899
Oliver.

515
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:06,975
You got something?

516
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,311
Just a lot of
suicidal Ghosts.

517
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:10,812
Yeah, and where does
that leave us?

518
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:12,013
Nowhere.
Honestly, Oliver,

519
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:13,482
this place is even
easier to break into

520
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:14,483
than your last lair.

521
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:15,951
What the hell's
going--

522
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:17,119
Dad!
Malcolm!

523
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:20,789
We're pressed for time.

524
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,859
Suffice it to say, I'm a little less dead
than most people think.

525
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:28,663
What are you doing here?

526
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:29,798
My daughter's in danger.

527
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,866
Shouldn't your first
question be

528
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:32,167
what took you so long?

529
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,170
What is this?

530
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,572
HIVE used polyphasic-encrypted
satellite phones

531
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:39,641
to communicate.
That is one of them.

532
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:42,377
And where did you get it?
I'm Ra's al Ghul.

533
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:43,678
Maybe we can use the
phone to track Darhk.

534
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,148
If Felicity were here,
maybe.

535
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,518
But as it is, our only play
is trading me for them.

536
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,887
Ok, listen, I'm not
gonna pretend to understand

537
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,655
what is going on
here.

538
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:56,091
But the idea of you
turning yourself over to Darhk,

539
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:57,826
that's the worst
idea I've heard in a while.

540
00:22:57,828 --> 00:22:59,995
Maybe, but it's
our only play.

541
00:22:59,997 --> 00:23:03,298
I brought all this on,
I have to end it.

542
00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:08,703
Well, I hope
you're all enjoying the city.

543
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:10,505
You know, we have
a lovely symphony

544
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,874
and the best coffee
on the western seaboard.

545
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,209
Wonderful.

546
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:16,478
Ms. Fayad said you like
to play games, Damien.

547
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,169
Games?

548
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:17,947
Yes.

549
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:20,448
Games. Now you're just
wasting our time.

550
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,851
We came here to check on
your progress with Genesis,

551
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:24,953
not to watch you exercise
a personal vendetta.

552
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:27,589
Oh, you're talking
about Oliver Queen's friends.

553
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:30,358
We have greater concerns
than some mayoral campaign.

554
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,261
That campaign's
involvement in the Star City Bay

555
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,330
turned out to be
a concern.

556
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,806
Well, folks, turns out
things are gonna get real interesting

557
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:47,609
real fast.

558
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,480
I was surprised
to get your call.

559
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,816
And on one of our
secure phones no less.

560
00:23:54,818 --> 00:23:57,519
You are more than
you see, Oliver.

561
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,554
Oh, you really
better hope that isn't true.

562
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:04,392
What's the word for a man
who threatens the man

563
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:06,761
who's holding his
nearest and dearest captive?

564
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,463
I don't know, idiot?

565
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:09,664
You didn't kill
my friends.

566
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,233
You took them
to make a point.

567
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:12,601
You've made it.

568
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,069
No.

569
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:17,739
Not yet I haven't.

570
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:28,208
I'm here.
Let my friends go.

571
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,844
I'm sorry, did you think this was
quid pro quo, Mr. Queen?

572
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,814
We have a deal.
Now let my friends go.

573
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:35,115
Patience.

574
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:40,387
Do you know who perfected
the gas chamber?

575
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,322
The Nazis.

576
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:46,226
For years I wondered why the world
would allow those monsters to exist,

577
00:24:46,228 --> 00:24:48,361
let alone thrive.

578
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,430
And then I realized, the
world needed them to.

579
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,999
As horrible as it sounds,
every now and then,

580
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:56,970
humanity needs a reset,
a do-over.

581
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:59,039
That time has come.

582
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,307
What is this?

583
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:01,675
A demonstration

584
00:25:01,677 --> 00:25:04,277
of the project that you're
gonna help us with

585
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,346
once we install you
as mayor.

586
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:09,683
Think of it as your friend's and
family's life insurance policy.

587
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:11,952
Oh.

588
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,122
Thank you for
your service,

589
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:19,226
your mind, and your
belief in me.

590
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:22,028
You will forever be
part of our HIVE.

591
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:35,442
The bloom is active.

592
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:37,043
Good.

593
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,848
Oh, and by the way,
thank you for doing the legwork

594
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,149
on skimming the bay.

595
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:44,684
My people were using
the harbor

596
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:46,820
to create
a certain type of algae.

597
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:51,057
One that would allow us
to do this undetected.

598
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,759
Oh, bummer.

599
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,895
Well, at least he lasted
longer than the previous one.

600
00:25:54,897 --> 00:25:57,030
I guess that's something.

601
00:25:57,032 --> 00:26:01,167
All right, let's continue to adjust
the ratio of the bloom.

602
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,671
If you told me I'd
ever get used to

603
00:26:04,673 --> 00:26:07,407
seeing you dressed
up like that, I'd...

604
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:10,577
Excellent. You've got
your bondage outfit on.

605
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,379
And no mask for you?

606
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:14,681
Not my thing.

607
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:16,182
If we're going
after Oliver,

608
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:17,517
wouldn't it make sense
for you to bring along

609
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,152
a few of your
little ninja friends?

610
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:21,221
I can't afford to
pit the League against HIVE.

611
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:22,689
Do you have
Oliver's location?

612
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:25,725
An abandoned industrial complex
outside Pennytown.

613
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:28,128
You'd think Darhk would have checked
to see if he was tagged with a tracker.

614
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,097
Well, I'm sure he did.
Damien's very thorough.

615
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,866
But Oliver had me
tag him

616
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:34,768
with the same
particular nano technology

617
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,269
he used on me
last year.

618
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:37,871
What about me?

619
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,639
No, you'll blow your
cover with Darhk.

620
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:40,907
It's pretty much
already blown.

621
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:43,043
Can you give us
the room?

622
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:44,444
Happily.
I have enough

623
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:46,513
father/daughter
drama in my life as it is.

624
00:26:46,515 --> 00:26:47,747
Good luck.

625
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:48,782
Thank you.

626
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:50,951
Remember, we're
on a clock.

627
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:54,054
Ok, if this is about
you not trusting me anymore

628
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:55,422
after working
with Darhk, then--

629
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:57,090
No, it's just the opposite.

630
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:59,059
You've done things,

631
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:00,727
things that you'll never
forgive yourself for,

632
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:01,962
because you were
protecting me,

633
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:03,563
but I'm the one
who gets to decide

634
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:05,565
whether I need
anyone's protection.

635
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:07,400
That's not how
parenting works, sweetheart.

636
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:09,836
I think that you and I
can both agree

637
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:13,340
that our relationship is
a little unconventional.

638
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:15,442
Mask should have
been the first clue.

639
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:17,477
Listen, sweetheart.

640
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:20,046
You just be careful
out there, all right?

641
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:23,483
'Cause I don't know what I'd do
if anything were to happen to you.

642
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:26,219
In fact, that's not true.
I know exactly what I would do.

643
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:28,355
And it'd be ugly.

644
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:38,131
These people,
they're volunteers?

645
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:41,201
True believers.
Every last one.

646
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:44,938
Oliver!

647
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,709
Aw. Well, I'll give you guys
some privacy to say your farewells.

648
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:56,816
Are John and Thea all right?

649
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:59,686
Yeah, I think so.

650
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:03,990
Please don't tell me
that you traded your life for ours,

651
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:06,826
because that
would be extremely old Oliver.

652
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:08,361
I had to turn myself in.

653
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:10,030
It was the only way
to know where you were being held.

654
00:28:10,032 --> 00:28:11,931
One little problem.
Two if you think

655
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:13,500
that Darhk is gonna
keep up his end of the bargain.

656
00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:15,201
But what happens
when the calvary shows up

657
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:16,870
and the Green Arrow's
not present?

658
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:17,971
Darhk is evil,
not stupid.

659
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:20,040
I have that handled,
Felicity.

660
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:22,108
It had to be this way.

661
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,678
Why? 'Cause you
think that we're in this situation

662
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,346
because of
your decisions?

663
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:29,783
Look, I really hate
to be the one

664
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,917
to break this
to you, Oliver,

665
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,952
but you are not
the boss of me.

666
00:28:32,954 --> 00:28:36,656
And I am the one who decides
whether I need anyone's protection.

667
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,160
But at the Christmas
party from hell,

668
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:42,696
you said you were
gonna propose and you didn't

669
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:44,597
because you weren't
sure our relationship

670
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,634
could survive
this kind of life.

671
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:49,369
It was a holiday party.

672
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,440
And I had more to say,
but we were attacked.

673
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,509
And here we are,
fighting.

674
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:59,345
Fighting our way
through the danger

675
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:02,682
instead of running
away from it.

676
00:29:02,684 --> 00:29:04,818
Isn't that the whole
point of marriage,

677
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,054
to get through the hard times
because we are together,

678
00:29:08,056 --> 00:29:09,756
not in spite of it?

679
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:12,358
Yeah.

680
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:18,732
Just so you know,
if you would have asked me,

681
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:21,568
I would have said
yes.

682
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:14,821
Ahh, thank you
for coming.

683
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:16,656
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

684
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:18,224
The deal is that I
bring myself here

685
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:20,026
and you let my friends go.

686
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:22,796
Hey!

687
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:24,130
Aah!

688
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,866
Let me go!

689
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,701
I'm so sorry
about this.

690
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:32,372
We had a deal!

691
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,940
I think if you replay
our conversation

692
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:36,509
in your mind, our bargain
was only at best implied.

693
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:39,078
Even so, bad guy,
remember?

694
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,180
You let them go.

695
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:41,948
I will.
Existentially speaking.

696
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,118
You do this, you lose
any leverage that you have over me.

697
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,020
Wrong. As long as
they're alive,

698
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,288
you have something
to fight for.

699
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,023
That is what
I am taking away from you.

700
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:51,758
But don't worry,
it's painless.

701
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,694
Well, mostly.

702
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:14,451
Look for seams.

703
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:16,252
This place may not be
100% sealed.

704
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:19,155
I love you.

705
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:25,795
Oh, Oliver, don't worry,
there are plenty of fish.

706
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:28,665
If it's blondes you like, I can have one
at your house in 20 minutes.

707
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,101
One that I won't kill.

708
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:02,198
Hey, come on, let's go.

709
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:07,270
I thought
I lost you.

710
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:09,506
I'm here.
I'm here.

711
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,876
Is that my father?

712
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:22,485
Really?

713
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:25,021
And here I was ready
to just call it even for the night.

714
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:27,957
You may go.

715
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,193
As the kids say,

716
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,028
I got this.

717
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,199
You really haven't
learned anything, have you?

718
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:39,135
Oh, I might have
learned a little.

719
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,141
Hi, there.

720
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:49,846
Where's Malcolm?

721
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:01,191
I'm dying to see
what's beneath that mask.

722
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,161
Seems like you're
dying a bit, too.

723
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,372
We shouldn't leave
all these guys here.

724
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:18,007
If they're anything like
Darhk's guy in the gas chamber,

725
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:19,008
we probably should.

726
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:27,083
Ok, they're definitely
like Darhk's guy in the gas chamber.

727
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:37,227
Is that the best
you've got?

728
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:39,462
There's four of you
and a lot more of us.

729
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:43,099
Yeah, well, now
there's five.

730
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:46,936
Uhh!

731
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:04,854
Guess you decided you didn't need
anyone's protection.

732
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,558
Brought the calvary.
Hope you don't mind.

733
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,627
Let's go!

734
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,100
Good news.

735
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:19,636
I'm gonna let you live
long enough to watch me

736
00:34:19,638 --> 00:34:21,638
kill your little
green buddy.

737
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:26,643
Get clear.

738
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:38,321
Kanjigar septum...

739
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:41,357
Vohostrum.

740
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,187
Are you sure that Darhk

741
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,588
didn't make it out of
the explosion?

742
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,320
Have you seen
any horror movies?

743
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:54,788
These guys don't stay dead.

744
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,024
Especially if
you can't find a body.

745
00:34:57,026 --> 00:34:59,459
Whoa.
Glass half empty much?

746
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:02,496
Good news is
whatever Darhk had going on there,

747
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:03,697
we lit it up
pretty good.

748
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:04,965
Where is Merlyn?

749
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,299
Said he had to
attend to League business.

750
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,601
Can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

751
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:08,702
but I owe him one.

752
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:10,537
I helped out
a little bit, too.

753
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:11,315
Yes, you did.

754
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:12,306
Wait.

755
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:13,774
Aren't we supposed to go
to that thingy?

756
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:14,775
What thingy?

757
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:16,410
It's a surprise.

758
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:18,252
You're not the only one
that can keep a secret.

759
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,719
What happened?

760
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:26,887
A shark.

761
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,389
Guess I don't taste
very good.

762
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:30,857
Uhh!

763
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:34,394
Ahh. That is gonna
leave a scar.

764
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:38,932
What?

765
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:41,068
Well, hey, Taiana.

766
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,837
You're a little less dead than
you're supposed to be.

767
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,273
And you, you may not
be a spy,

768
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:47,874
but you're
definitely a liar.

769
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:51,344
Which means you're
probably lying about being a spy.

770
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:54,714
I'm gonna enjoy
taking pieces out of you.

771
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,355
What do you want?

772
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:05,423
To talk.

773
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:07,225
Thought you gave up
on that.

774
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:10,161
I did, until I met
your cult leader, Damien Darhk.

775
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:11,763
It's not a cult.

776
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:13,264
The man has people,
regular people,

777
00:36:13,266 --> 00:36:14,766
honest people,
I'm thinking,

778
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:17,835
so brainwashed
they're willing to die for him.

779
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:19,537
Cult.

780
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:21,005
You know what, think what
you want to think.

781
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:23,341
It's a free country.

782
00:36:23,343 --> 00:36:25,109
For now.

783
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:27,111
This isn't you,
Andy.

784
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:32,817
The man I knew

785
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:35,186
pulled me out of
dark waters,

786
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:37,789
convinced me to keep
going when I didn't see the point.

787
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,825
No, what you didn't see,
what you failed to see

788
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:43,361
is the man I really am,

789
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:45,963
right in front of you
the whole time.

790
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:47,732
So my brother's
a Ghost?

791
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:52,637
Fine, we'll treat
you like a Ghost.

792
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:01,012
Your vigilante problem's
getting worse.

793
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:02,747
Oh, relax, Ms. Nixon.

794
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:04,482
Focus on the here and now.

795
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:06,551
There's concerns
that you're leading us off the rails.

796
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:12,457
No, I'm leading us exactly
where we need to be.

797
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,492
Beautiful, isn't it?

798
00:37:14,494 --> 00:37:16,928
And I don't even
like corn.

799
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,063
Go ahead, breathe.

800
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:20,531
Drink it in.

801
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,100
Tell me what it
reminds you of.

802
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:23,234
Seems so real.

803
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:25,636
Ahh, I liken it to
the air on Everest.

804
00:37:25,638 --> 00:37:27,004
Little thin, maybe,

805
00:37:27,006 --> 00:37:29,240
but just enough
to keep things interesting.

806
00:37:29,242 --> 00:37:31,709
I thought the tests
had failed.

807
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,244
Not the last one.

808
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:35,780
Thanks to the algae
we engineered from Star City Bay,

809
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:38,616
the air down here is now
perfectly breathable.

810
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:42,186
We are right on schedule.

811
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:44,055
Phase 4 begins now.

812
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,524
And what of Oliver Queen?

813
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,131
This is all
Alex's idea.

814
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,432
He wanted to show
the people

815
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,200
that you're not
backing down.

816
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:58,069
All you got to do is, uh,
flick a switch and give a speech.

817
00:37:58,071 --> 00:37:59,670
That's it?

818
00:37:59,672 --> 00:38:01,639
We'll be here waiting for you
when you're done.

819
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:04,075
You're coming with me.

820
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:05,309
No. Whoa.

821
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:06,978
Ohh.

822
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,581
Oh, jeez.

823
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,416
Thank you.

824
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:14,252
Thank you, everyone.

825
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:19,791
This week, an event just
like this was interrupted by terrorists.

826
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:21,159
But all of us
are here tonight

827
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:26,063
to send those people
a very simple message.

828
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:27,999
We're not gonna let
the darkness win.

829
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:32,036
So all of us are here to
light a candle together.

830
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:33,504
United.

831
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:42,914
This right there's possible
because of all of you,

832
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,850
and I am grateful
for each one of you.

833
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:48,986
There is one person
in particular

834
00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:53,157
that I am grateful for.

835
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:55,526
You.

836
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:59,130
Someone that has stood
beside me

837
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:02,934
when times were darkest.

838
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:06,103
She is the one
who lights my way.

839
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:12,877
Felicity Smoak...

840
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:18,449
Would you make me

841
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:22,987
the happiest man on
the face of the earth?

842
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:26,157
Yes?

843
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,725
Yes.

the truth,

848
00:40:05,665 --> 00:40:07,064
I don't even care
