00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,189
The grouping on hunt's
chest was tight.

164
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,308
It's a compound bow,
most likely.

165
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,360
The guy is a...

166
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:34,112
The guy's
a legitimate archer.

167
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,500
So someone who would be
particular

168
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,699
about his choice of arrows.

169
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,592
We get an arrow,

170
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:42,410
we get a bead on where
he purchased them.

171
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,038
So what are you gonna do?

172
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:51,996
What anyone does
when they need help.

173
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,001
Call a cop.

174
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,587
Quentin Lance?

175
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,923
Yeah.

176
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:04,308

I didn't kill Adam Hunt.

181
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,502
You...

182
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,622
You call me the Hood.
It's not a great nickname.

183
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:37,625
You told commissioner Nudocerdo
that you might be dealing with a copycat,

184
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,526
Another archer,
which makes me your best bet

185
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,551
to take him down.

186
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,681
But I need your help.

187
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,050
I need one of the arrows
from his murder.

188
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,352
Yeah, we're pretty good at pulling
down leads off evidence. Thanks.

189
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:52,390
Not like I am. I can do things
the police can't,

190
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,008
go places they won't.

Like I said,
I don't even know who--

192
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,002
If this archer doesn't stop
with Adam Hunt,

193
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:59,681
we both have a problem.

194
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,949
Think about it.

195
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,651
Then call me.

Of course.

200
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,132
How is the construction
coming along

201
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,533
on the Applied Sciences
Center?

202
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,701
Over budget
and behind schedule.

203
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,637
Exactly as expected.

204
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,388
Is that what you wanted
to see me about?

205
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,141
No.

206
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:33,848
Adam Hunt. He was murdered
last night by the vigilante.

207
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,349
I read about that.

208
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,068
I've been concerned
by the idea

209
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,936
that the vigilante
might target an employee

210
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,572
or officer of this company.

211
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,574
Security red-flagged you.

212
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,228
Me? Why would this guy
go after me?

213
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,780
Well, that's a point I was
hoping you could shed some light on.

214
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,232
You got me.
From what I've read,

215
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,835
this vigilante only goes after
white-collar criminals.

216
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:57,121
Well, let's just hope
he doesn't decide to branch out.

217
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:03,544
I think there should be
a national holiday

218
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:06,347
for the guy that
invented French fries.

219
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,050
Or at least a statue
or something.

220
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:13,187
There is no Christmas party,
is there?

221
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:17,024
Thea, dad threw one of these
every year.

222

Do people think I just
wasn't gonna notice?

Hi, Thea.

Hi. Shane.

225
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,150
This is my brother
Oliver.

226
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,402
Nice to meet you, Thea's brother.
I bet the food on that island is better

227
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,704
than this stuff
they're serving here, huh?

228
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,706
You'd lose that bet.

We're heading down to the bay
to hang out if you want to come.

Thanks, but I'm spending
the afternoon with my brother.

How do you know
that Shane guy?

crack together.

That's funny, yeah. I have a feeling
I'm not gonna be a fan.

Let's change the subject.

238
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,269
Fine. You were gonna tell me

239
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,272
why we're not having
the annual Christmas party.

240
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,192
[Sighs]

241
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,246
When you and dad
disappeared,

242
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:15,283
by the time Christmas
rolled around,

243
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,535
none of us felt
much like celebrating,

244
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:23,040
so we kind of skipped
Christmas that year.

245
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,960
Every year.

246
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,629
And it's really fine,
so...

247
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:33,851
No. No, it's really not.

248
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,474
We're celebrating Christmas.

249
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,226
I went 5 years without it,
and then Thea tells me

250
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,678
that you guys didn't have it either
and I'm the reason.

251
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,114
So maybe now
I can be the reason

252
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:49,867
we have Christmas again.

253
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:54,021
I thought I would throw
the Queen Christmas party.

254
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,556
You?

255
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:59,910
I know that I haven't
been the son

256
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,580
or the stepson
or the brother

257
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,165
that all of you deserve.

258
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,200
Especially lately.

259
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,535
But this feels like
the right moment

260
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,757
to start making up
for lost time.

261
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,058
What do you say?

262
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,811
I say yes.

263
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,763
Yes! Okay. I will take
care of everything.

264
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,047
You don't have
to do anything.

265
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,049
Just show up,
look fantastic,

266
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,018
and bring some
Christmas cheer, okay?

267
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,320
Okay.

268
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:30,491
Fine.

269
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,327
You're a good man, Oliver.

270
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:39,333
You're a good man.

271
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,535
I can see it.

272
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:46,407
Well, beneath the privileged
upbringing and the wealthy veneer.

273
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,410
I saw it when my man
tortured you

274
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,429
and you wouldn't give up
your friend.

275
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,248
Not even a friend, really.

276
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,766
Someone you just met.

277
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,068
Shut up.

278
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,437
What do you know him?

279
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,389
Nothing, I suspect.

280
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:06,760
Do you even know
what this island really is?

281
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,698
It's a prison.
I mean this literally.

282
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,068
Until 8 years ago,
the Chinese military

283
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,239
operated this island
as a penitentiary

284
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:21,292
for criminals
deemed so dangerous,

285
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:24,245
they couldn't be safely
incarcerated on the mainland.

286
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,881
When the military
shut the program down,

287
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:30,634
my unit came in and disposed
of all the inmates.

288
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,921
With the exception of two.

289
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:36,623
Your friend was one of them.

290
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,128
Who was the other?

291
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,396
You met him.

292
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,482
He presided over
your interrogation.

293
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,283
He tortured me.

294
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,069
You had information
I needed.

295
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,354
What would you do
in my position?

296
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,273
What would you do
to capture the man

297
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,826
who slaughtered
dozens of people?

298
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:05,669
Douglas Miller came to see me today,
quite concerned.

299
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,955
He said your husband
interrogated him,

300
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,958
and his questions suggested
a knowledge he shouldn't have

301
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,327
of the list.

302
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,347
Let me talk to him.

303
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,049
I think we're past the point
of conversation, Moira.

304
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,719
A month ago you came to me
and you told me

305
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:25,172
to stay away from
your family, and I did.

306
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,175
But your family isn't
staying away from me.

307
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:32,229
Which means something
must be done about it.

308
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,847
Don't you agree?

309
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,366
Yes, I do.

310
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,034
And I'll handle it.

311
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,702
I guess what I'm wondering is,

312
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,405
whether it's time for
our associate to handle it.

313
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:47,962
Hell, yeah,
I returned the money.

314
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:51,298
$70 million isn't worth getting
an arrow through the chest.

315
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,020
And you can tell him,

316
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:54,586
if he's got a problem
with that, he can--

[thwack thwack]

318
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:08,015
Commissioner,
this is Nelson Ravich.

319
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,984
The Hood hit him
earlier this week.

320
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:13,521
Ravich wired back the money he
embezzled less than 5 minutes later.

321
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,858
All right.

322
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,063
We tell the press
the Hood did this.

323
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,868
Hunt's murder
is a page 10 story, at best.

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,388
But Ravich makes this
a serial murder case.

325
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,341
We can't let the public
get wind of the idea

326
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:37,044
that there are two
of these nut jobs running around.

327
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,079
You want me to ignore
a serial killer.

328
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,265
Just catch one of these psychos.
I don't care which one.

329
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,935
That is a direct order
from your commanding officer.

330
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:50,191
Well, you can forget it, then.

331
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:53,110
Fine.

332
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,979
It's forgotten.

333
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,764
And you're off
this case, Sergeant,

334
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,284
effective immediately.

335

[Ringing]

336
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,731
Don't bother trying
to trace this back to me.

337
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,583
You'll never make it
through the encryption.

338
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,986
There's a heating vent
on the corner of O'Neil and Adams.

339
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,155
You'll find what
you're after there.

340
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,141
It'd be a mistake
to set a trap for me, Detective.

341
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,510
I'm trading away just about
everything I believe in here

342
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:45,613
'cause it's the only
way I've got to get this bastard.

343
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,814
You got till Christmas.

344
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,751
And then, copycat or not...

345
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:53,470
I'm coming after you.

346
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:07,836
So your friend Lance gave you
a Christmas present after all.

347
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,472
-Hmm.

348
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:14,026
Teflon-coated titanium blade
serrated to split the bone.

349
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:17,212
Shaft is some type
of specialized polymer,

350
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:19,098
which is stronger than
a typical carbon fiber.

351
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,985
This...this is
a custom job.

352
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:25,354
So Lance gave in after after the
other archer dropped another body.

353
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:26,522
Nelson Ravich.

354
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:27,823
Which is another name

355
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:31,010
you crossed off
your dad's list.

356
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:35,497
So is this guy trying to frame you
or call you out?

357
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:40,085
Either way,
I need to find him.

358
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,710
Oh.

359
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,584
Hey.

[Gasps] Don't you knock?

361
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,556
Felicity, this is
the I.T. department.

362
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,257
It's not the ladies room.

363
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,227
Right.

364
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,029
What can I do for you?

365
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,331
My buddy Steve
is really into archery.

366
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,151
Apparently
it's all the rage now.

367
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:15,237
I don't know why. It's looks
utterly ridiculous to me.

368
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,705
Mm-hmm.

369
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:19,241
Anyway, it's Steve's
birthday next weekend,

370
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,160
and I wanted
to buy him some arrows.

371
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:26,203
The thing is, he gets these special
custom-made arrows,

372
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:29,998
and I have no idea
where he gets them.

373
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,923
I was hoping you could find out
where this came from.

374
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,761
- Careful.
- Yeah.

375
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,771
The shaft's composite
is patented.

376
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,614
And that patent is registered
to a company called Sagittarius.

377
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,916
That's Latin for the archer.

378
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,368
Really?

379
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,119
Could you find out
where and when

380
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,788
this was purchased?

381
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,927
According to Sagittarius
company records,

382
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:17,132
that particular arrow
was part of a bundle shipment.

383
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,835
200 units.

384

387
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,695
You're remarkable.

388
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:32,681
Thank you for remarking
on it.

389
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,351
And Merry Christmas.

The significant resources
of the Starling City police department

393
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:55,036
is clear that this vigilante's
cycle of violence has escalated.

394
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,140
I'm asking our citizens
to keep a close eye out

395
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:00,642
and to report
anything suspicious.

396
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:02,227
A tip line has been set up,

397
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,346
and a reward
will be offered

398
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,565
to anyone who aids
the authorities

399
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:09,935
in the capture
of this madman.

It isn't him,
is it?

401

We are all frustrated with the
crime plaguing our city.

didn't kill those people.

he was a monster.

protecting me.

of this so-called "Hood"

terrorizing our city.

I was saying that,

649
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:19,706
that was me being a bitch.

650
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:23,293
Oh, the truth is, I don't think any
of us were at our best.

651
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:25,178
The real truth is,
you wanted to have

652
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,630
a party to bring us
closer together.

653
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,549
Well...

654
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,851
here we are.

655
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:36,139
[Chuckles] Ahh!

656
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:39,392
We're going to let you
get some rest, hmm?

657
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:49,685
So...

658
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:53,022
We never got
to the exchanging presents part.

659
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,457
[Chuckles]

660
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,493
I don't think
I deserve a present.

661
00:37:56,495 --> 00:38:00,696
Look, I know
that I've been hard on you,

662
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:03,133
about being different

663
00:38:03,135 --> 00:38:05,902
from the way you were.

664
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:07,870
But the truth is,

665
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,757
Ollie, I'm not
the same person

666
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:12,976
I was five years ago, either.

667
00:38:12,978 --> 00:38:17,947
So maybe we can just
accept each other.

668
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:20,100
Not for who we were,

669
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:21,668
but for the--

670
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,571
for the people
we are now.

671
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:27,190
Yeah.

672
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,844
Ohh!

673
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:33,279
No cheating.

674
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:35,448
You're on.
Come here.

675
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,317
Aww.

676
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:02,540
Thank you, Felicity.
It was good of you to call,

677
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,292
but Oliver's
going to be fine.

678
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:06,578
He's already on the mend.

679
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,130
I'm stepping into
an elevator,

680
00:39:09,132 --> 00:39:11,198
so I'll probably lose you.

681
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,535
I'll call you
straight back. Bye.

682
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:21,876
It's done.
And he won't be harmed?

683
00:39:21,878 --> 00:39:23,878
Nor will he ever discover
your involvement.

684
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,146
You have my word.

685
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:26,648
Forgive me if I don't
find that comforting.

686
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,317
You were warned,
Moira.

687
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:31,886
I told you to get
Walter under control,

688
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,220
and you couldn't.

689
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:34,939
Steps had
to be taken.

690
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:37,725
That's what you said
to justify Robert's murder.

691
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:40,445
And you wonder why
I don't trust you.

692
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,363
Quite a bid of judgment
coming from the woman

693
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:44,832
who had her son
kidnapped and tortured.

694
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:47,168
To prove to you that Oliver
didn't know anything.

695
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,537
And what does it matter now?

696
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:52,674
What's done is done.
No, Moira.

697
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:55,476
It's just beginning.
In six months,

698
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:58,046
the organization's vision of what
this city should be

699
00:39:58,048 --> 00:40:00,014
will be complete.

700
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:04,018
And you won't feel
a thing then, will you?

701
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,721
Thousands of innocent people
will be dead,

702
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:08,523
and you'll feel nothing.

703
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:10,358
That's not true.

704
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,862
I'll feel a sense
of accomplishment.

705
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:17,482
And you'll have
Walter back.

706
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:22,820
[Car door closes]

707
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,745
[Exhales]

708
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:32,914
[Oliver groaning]

709
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,471
You know, Dig,

710
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:44,158
when I confront
somebody on the list,

711
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,511
I tell them

712
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:49,964
that they failed
the city.

713
00:40:49,966 --> 00:40:53,467
But tonight,
it was me who failed.

714
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:56,154
Oliver, five hostages
are home tonight with their families

715
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:59,524
enjoying the holidays.

716
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:01,859
Because of you.

717
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:06,247
This guy,
the other archer...

718
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:09,150
He'll get his.

719
00:41:09,152 --> 00:41:10,985
And you'll give it to him.

720
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:14,488
We might have
a bigger problem.

721
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:21,212
The other archer told me
that somebody compiled the list.

722
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:23,848
I always assumed

723
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,551
it was my father.

724
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:31,839
But what if it wasn't?

725
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:33,241
What do you mean?

726
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:37,779
I think there's
someone else out there.

727
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:40,982
Someone who's
more of a danger

728
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:43,234
than the archer.

729
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:50,429
And I am going
to take him down.
