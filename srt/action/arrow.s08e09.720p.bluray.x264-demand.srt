1
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,104
Bianca!

2
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Bianca Bertinelli?

3
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:50,926
Who the hell are you?

4
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,155
Your life's in danger.
I'm gonna need you to come with me now.

5
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:56,224
My night's just
getting started. Bye.

6
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:12,907
Get off. Get off!

7
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:15,784
Help!

8
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,299
<i>Seeking his third
straight term, Mayor Ramirez</i>

9
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:15,011
<i>has declared Star City
the safest city in the country.</i>

10
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,430
<i>In other news, the vigilante
museum has received</i>

11
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,599
<i>a generous seven-figure donation</i>

12
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,559
<i>from Victor
and Maria Bertinelli.</i>

13
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,037
Hey. What are you doing?

14
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,854
Babe! You scared me.

15
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:28,316
I'm just the guy who you share your bed
with most nights.

16
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,859
Hm? Remember me?

17
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:32,737
How could I forget?
Your snoring always reminds me.

18
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:33,904
I don't snore.

19
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,033
Look, I know you
hate to be anything less than perfect,

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,702
but you do, like
old man style.

21
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,329
Ha ha. Right.

22
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,252
I got up early to finish writing
my speech.

23
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,421
Wait. Is there something
special happening today?

24
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,256
Funny.

25
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:55,009
A gift for the graduate.

26
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,018
Wait what's happening?

27
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,106
Mia Queen,

28
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,068
I love you more than anything
in the whole world.

29
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,319
Will you marry me?

30
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,741
Please say yes.

31
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,035
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah?

32
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,578
Of course.
I love you so much.

33
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,392

Dinah, this is where
you've been living?

47
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,731
Well, it's right
above the bar,

48
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,150
and it has got
a hell of a view.

49
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,946
Black Canary and the captain of SCPD
now owns a bar.

50
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
Also, when'd you
learn to sing?

51
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,076
We didn't have much time
for karaoke back in 2020, did we?

52
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,080
So how did you
find me? Sara?

53
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,750
She said that she found you here
a couple months ago

54
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,591
and that you didn't want
to come back with her.

55
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,757
The day after Oliver's
funeral in 2020,

56
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:00,842
I woke up here.

57
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,553
I had no idea how or why.

58
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,516
When I got here, I found out that
I don't even exist.

59
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,476
I'm sorry. How is that
even possible?

60
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,938
I don't know, but there is no trace
of Dinah Drake or the Black Canary.

61
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:15,066
And what,
you're just fine with that?

62
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,277
I guess I came
to realize that

63
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,488
not having an identity
can either be sad

64
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,740
or it can be oddly
freeing.

65
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,993
I can let go of
the people I lost,

66
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,954
mistakes that I made.

67
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,165
I'm not gonna lie,
your zen is kind of creeping me out.

68
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,332
Thank you.

69
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,313
You know, there has been
no real crime in Star City

70
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,421
in 20 years, Laurel.

71
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,590
And zen's not that
hard to come by.

72
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,401
Well, I hate
to break it to you,

73
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,262
but Star City
isn't safe anymore.

74
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,516
Bianca Bertinelli's
been abducted.

75
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:49,891
Helena's daughter.

76
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,979
The socialite. Why...
why would anybody want to hurt her?

77
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,606
Money, revenge, something
to do with Helena.

78
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:59,402
Who the hell knows?
D, I need you to help me find her.

79
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,029
You really came all
the way to the future

80
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,365
to rescue a kidnapped
socialite?

81
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,997
- What am I looking at?
- Star City 2041.

82
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:12,609
This is a year from now.

83
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,543
It's not possible.
The city's safe.

84
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,752
Doesn't stay that way.

85
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,754
Because Bianca Bertinelli
gets kidnapped?

86
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,381
No. Because she dies.

87
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,009
Three days from now,
her body is found in the bay,

88
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,343
her killer never caught.

89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
The city falls apart.

90
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,763
Everything that Oliver
sacrificed his life for.

91
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,894
I thought this part of
my life was done, Laurel.

92
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,398
Then don't do it for you.
Do it for Oliver.

93
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,734
Okay.

94
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,361
For Oliver.

95
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,362
Good.

96
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,217
Now there's one more person we need
who's well-connected.

97
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,452
- And who is that?
- I'll inform you on the way.

98
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,371
You do have something
nicer to wear, right?

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,374
<i>♪ Lookin' over you ♪</i>

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,710
<i>♪ Is something I do ♪</i>

101
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,421
<i>♪ Finally had to look... ♪</i>

102
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,360
Ms. Queen,
when is the wedding date?

103
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,195
What are you going to do
now that you've graduated?

104
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,299
Not sure yet
on both counts.

105
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,668
What would
your dad think about your life choices?

106
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,646
My father saved Star City
so that we can enjoy it,

107
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,190
and he also never
graduated college,

108
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,942
so I think he'd be
pretty impressed.

109
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,069
- Ms. Queen?
- Ms. Queen...

110
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,700
It was my mom's.

111
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,827
JJ knew I'd want
the family ring.

112
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,994
He's honestly the most
thoughtful guy in the world.

113
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,207
Can I just say what
an amazing man of honor

114
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:37,833
I'm gonna make
at your wedding?

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,502
William!

116
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,254
Zoe, hi!

117
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,033
I hope you don't
mind me crashing.

118
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,300
Never.
So good to see you.

119
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,051
Where's Keven?

120
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,263
No. I thought he
was the one.

121
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,684
Yeah. Well, apparently
only having one partner was his problem.

122
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,894
But it's fine.
This is your day.

123
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,771
And speaking of, tomorrow

124
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,273
there's gonna be an office for you
at Smoak Tech.

125
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,709
How many times do I
have to tell you,

126
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,610
tech is not
really my passion?

127
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,070
What is your
passion exactly?

128
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,737
I don't know.

129
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,615
Because you can't
be a socialite forever.

130
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,534
Hmm, she technically can.

131
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,370
No. No, I'm sorry. She is
way too smart for that.

132
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:15,997
Okay, can I just enjoy
tonight

133
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,498
before I have to start
adulting?

134
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,875
Fine. But I need a drink.

135
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,360
I just want to thank you
all for coming tonight.

136
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:29,635
You are my life.

137
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:33,514
I particularly want to thank JJ
for always having my back.

138
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,682
I love you so much.

139
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,933
And William.

140
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,770
I could not imagine
life without you.

141
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:43,065
Thank you for always tolerating
your little sister,

142
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:46,485
even when I did draw all over
your walls when I was five.

143
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,237
- To the class of 2040.
- 2040!

144
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,073
Whoo!

145
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,790
Sorry, is it all right
for me to be here?

146
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,792
I'm sure it's okay.
Hey.

147
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,961
I thought you were
still in rehab, Connor.

148
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:05,856
What's the matter, trust fund?

149
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,441
You don't want me
at your fancy little party?

150
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,967
As long as you don't
punch anyone or set anything on fire,

151
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,092
we'll be okay.

152
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,639
Can we just try to get along
for one night, please?

153
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,142
- Be right back.
- Okay.

154
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,145
Hey, Trev, have you
seen Bianca?

155
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,789
She was supposed to be
here an hour ago.

156
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,607
No, I'm not
her keeper anymore.

157
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,543
Okay, I thought you
guys were still cool.

158
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,211
No, we are, but even when
we were together,

159
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,475
she never told me
where she was.

160
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,339
But you were the last
to see her, weren't you?

161
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,113
Excuse me?

162
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,634
Your number was
the last one she texted.

163
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,658
Uh, who the hell
are you?

164
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,136
Wait. I-is something wrong
with Bianca?

165
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,286
I don't know. You tell us.

166
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,037
Ah...

167
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,292
You can't just crash my party
and harass my guests.

168
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,459
Do you know who I am?

169
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,669
A lot more than you do.

170
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,838
We were friends
of your parents.

171
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,091
Then how come I've
never seen either of you before?

172
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,510
Long story and less than
zero time to explain.

173
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,261
Your friend Bianca,
she's in trouble.

174
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,097
And we need your help
to find her.

175
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,557
Yeah. I'm calling security.

176
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,977
No, I'm sorry to take
you out of your bubble,

177
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,355
but we really need you.

178
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,929
<i>I know
how to protect myself.</i>

179
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>- You made sure of that.
- I sure did.</i>

180
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,468
<i>The four of you are
the heroes that the city needs.</i>

181
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,831
<i>We are staring
at our father alive!</i>

182
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,624
<i>Dad. So what's next?</i>

183
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,378
<i>Mar Novu has
seen my fate.</i>

184
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,047
- Dad...
<i>- I don't survive Crisis.</i>

185
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,389
Mia.

186
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:47,398
- Back off.
- Um, I'm sorry. You fainted.

187
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,204
Are you okay?

188
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,663
Oh, my God.

189
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:10,212
Sorry. Uh, sorry. I... I guess
I had too much to drink

190
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,922
without eating or something.

191
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,091
Maybe you should lie down,
party animal.

192
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,634
I think I need some air.

193
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,470
- Hey, Mia, listen...
- Ooh. No.

194
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,695
What the hell did
you do to me?

195
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,614
I would love to know that
myself.

196
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,158
There's this guy,
J'onn J'onzz.

197
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,701
He's a Martian or something.

198
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,787
He's why we remember everything
that happened before the Crisis.

199
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,372
Cisco was able to replicate

200
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,708
the Martian's powers
using tech.

201
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,294
So a friend of
Supergirl's has a power

202
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,861
a friend of the Flash
can replicate.

203
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,631
Yeah.
That's what I said.

204
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:55,817
I want to say that
you guys are crazy

205
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,426
and that none of this
is possible,

206
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,386
but I know you're right.

207
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,513
I remember everything,

208
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,807
you two fighting
alongside my dad,

209
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,517
Zoe dying, my...

210
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,646
my fiancé killing her.

211
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:13,901
I remember
my father dying.

212
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,031
Why would you do
this to me?

213
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,908
Look, there'll be time
for emotions later.

214
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,744
I woke you up because
your friend Bianca was kidnapped.

215
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,580
But there hasn't been any
crime in Star City in 20 years.

216
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,457
What is that, like
the city's motto now?

217
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,167
You don't know Bianca,
all right?

218
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,003
She's flaky. She's probably on a beach
somewhere having a ball.

219
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,546
I saw her, and she
was taken.

220
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,047
How are you even
hesitating?

221
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,688
Aren't you supposed
to be the Green Arrow?

222
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,551
Not anymore.

223
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,280
Mia, I understand
that you are torn

224
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,555
between two worlds
right now,

225
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,722
but we need your help.

226
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,434
Look, I don't even know
if I can do this anymore, okay?

227
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,936
I haven't trained. I don't...

228
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,316
See?
Just like riding a bike.

229
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,320
Is Bianca actually
in trouble?

230
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,699
Yes. And if we don't
find her, she's going to die.

231
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,035
Fine. I will help you.

232
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,413
But this is
a one-time thing.

233
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,623
Okay, I'm not interested
in joining

234
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,041
your Canary club, all right?

235
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,252
I have a life now,
I am happy,

236
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,938
and I would like to
keep it that way.

237
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:15,962
Whatever.

238
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,530
Where was Bianca
when she was taken?

239
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,091
Partying at Club V.

240
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,885
Nothing Bianca loved more
than a good party.

241
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,304
Oh, to be in my
20s again.

242
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,849
Ick. Hard pass.
I was married at 21.

243
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,768
Seriously?
Who are you?

244
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,396
Bianca.
She was adopted.

245
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,064
Any chance that
created tension?

246
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,900
Helena was a great mom
before she disappeared.

247
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,871
She lives with her
great-aunt and uncle now.

248
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,826
Back in the old Star City,
the Bertinellis were

249
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,546
one of the biggest
crime families around.

250
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,098
Well, that sounds
like enough reason

251
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,118
to violate some
privacy laws.

252
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,495
It's time for you

253
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,581
to pay that family
a little visit.

254
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,087
I'm sorry Bianca missed your party.
You know how she is.

255
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:58,464
Free spirit.

256
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,257
Totally. Actually,

257
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,426
I wanted to speak
with you about that.

258
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,138
I think Bianca might be
in some kind of trouble.

259
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,639
What kind of trouble?

260
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,976
Mia's in position.
D, you're up.

261
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,906
- <i>You ready?</i>
- Never not.

262
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,356
I think Bianca might
have been taken.

263
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,816
That's ridiculous.

264
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,193
You know how safe it is here.

265
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,153
I haven't been able
to contact her in days.

266
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Her social media is quiet, it's...

267
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,090
she's not even
posting those videos

268
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,366
she's always
addicted to making.

269
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,532
I wouldn't worry
about it.

270
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,011
In a couple days,
we're gonna find out

271
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,578
she's been, uh,
what partying

272
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,465
off the coast of
Corto Maltese or something.

273
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,464
<i>Dinah, what's your progress?</i>

274
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
Three more rooms to go.

275
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,687
You're about to have company,

276
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,962
one of the help,
I'm guessing.

277
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,173
Mia, we need a distraction.

278
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,302
Wouldn't it be better
to be safe than sorry?

279
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,346
I mean, maybe since
we're here,

280
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,556
if we call the police...
oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

281
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,043
Logan, get Remy!

282
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,684
Remy?

283
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,440
Remy, we've got
an emergency.

284
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,655
Do us a favor.
Stop worrying about Bianca.

285
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:05,905
She's fine.

286
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,282
Okay, I will.

287
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,781
I'm clear.

288
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,911
Please tell me
you got those eyes and ears placed.

289
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,370
All of them.

290
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,082
We can see and hear everything
that goes down in that house.

291
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,875
Good. I'll meet you
at the bar.

292
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,062
I want to talk to Bianca's
friends, see what they know.

293
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,397
- You want company?
<i>- Ha.</i>

294
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,756
And have to explain who you two
are again? No, thanks.

295
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,137
You know, I could get used to all
this free alcohol.

296
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,848
So that means you will not be paying
your tab downstairs.

297
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,267
I thought it was a friends drink for
free kind of place.

298
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,212
They say anything
interesting yet?

299
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,646
A couple stock tips,
where to vacation,

300
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,273
nothing that helps.

301
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,984
Oh, man. This is
one hell of a view.

302
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,986
I can see why you
hide out here.

303
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,530
Subtle. I am not hiding.

304
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,116
I told you, the world
doesn't remember who I am.

305
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,993
Don't you
remember you?

306
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,370
I really don't expect
you to understand.

307
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,121
Try me.

308
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,433
I mean, isn't this
what friends do?

309
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,001
They sit around and drink,
talk about their problems.

310
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,922
Okay, well, when I first
ended up here,

311
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,925
I spent a lot of time
asking myself why.

312
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:11,180
It took a while, but I think
I finally understand the answer.

313
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,201
This is the universe's
way of telling me

314
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,978
I'm not supposed
to be a hero.

315
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,938
Why? Because you didn't
get a gold star?

316
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,108
Because in this version of the future,
the one where I'm not a hero,

317
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,485
everyone is
better off.

318
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,154
Mia's happ...
Mia was happy

319
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,697
until we dragged
her into this.

320
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,742
Zoe's alive because
she's not a Canary.

321
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,287
And all of a sudden,
what, you're gun shy?

322
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,623
Zoe didn't die because
she was a Canary.

323
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,375
She died because she was
a hero, because you

324
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:44,129
inspired her and a bunch of
other women just like her

325
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,219
to fight for something
greater than themselves,

326
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,091
myself included.

327
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,138
What, are you guys
on a break or something?

328
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,182
It's called surveillance.

329
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,826
How did it go
with Bianca's friends?

330
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,850
Let me guess.

331
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,775
"Oh, Bianca was just being Bianca.

332
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,737
And, oh, my gosh, what
shoes am I gonna wear?"

333
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,385
They didn't know anything.

334
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,739
And, by the way,
three of them went to Harvard.

335
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,817
That's awesome.

336
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,819
Oh.

337
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,699
Logan Bertinelli
just got chatty. Hang on.

338
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,372
He's worried about something,
"taking precautions,"

339
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,500
specifically moving "it"
out of the city.

340
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,752
What are the odds
"it" is Bianca?

341
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,129
Logan's an ass, but he
wouldn't kidnap his cousin.

342
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,173
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

343
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,007
Let's suit up.

344
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,178
<i>You earned it.</i>

345
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm not wearing that.

346
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,100
- Why? It's yours.
- It's my father's.

347
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,004
She doesn't have to wear it
if she doesn't want to, Laurel.

348
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:42,687
Fine.

349
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,610

W-what the hell are you

359
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,141
Secure our friggin' position.

360
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,711
You go get Bianca, and
we'll take care of Logan and his friends.

361
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,295
- What?
- You'll be fine.

365
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,656
Bianca's not here.

366
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,839
Looks like some kind of
chemical or drug.

367
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,118
I... I give up, okay?

368
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,371
Run!

369
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,466
Well, that could've gone
better.

370
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,688
You've got some nerve
leaving me alone out there.

371
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,523
What if I hadn't remembered
how to fight?

372
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,817
But you did.
You're welcome.

373
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:52,984
I could've died.

374
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,196
Okay, that's a little dramatic.
We were there the whole time.

375
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,447
D, some help, please?

376
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,907
It was pretty
risky, Laurel.

377
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,201
How about less talking
about your hurt feelings

378
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,620
and more talking about
the fact that your fiancé

379
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,580
just became
suspect number one?

380
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,416
There is no way
this is JJ.

381
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,210
The guy who attacked us
in the Deathstroke mask?

382
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,045
You do know who
Deathstroke is, right?

383
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,005
It could've been anyone
under that mask.

384
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,852
It does seem like
a pretty big coincidence,

385
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,509
especially given who JJ
was before.

386
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,010
I mean, he used to lead them.

387
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,657
Yeah, and I used to be
a cage fighter.

388
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,305
That is not who I am
anymore,

389
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,015
and that is clearly
not who JJ is.

390
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,267
Are you really that naive?

391
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,144
Are you really
that judgmental?

392
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,746
You don't even have
the slightest bit of doubt

393
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,398
that JJ is the one who is
behind that mask?

394
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:33,858
No.

395
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,152
Prove it.

396
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,822
Mia Queen.
These are my plus-two.

397
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,952
See? A much better idea
than punching our way in.

398
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,559
- Hm.
- A lot less fun, though.

399
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,984
Mia, you sure
you're up for this?

400
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,791
I'm here, aren't I?
JJ's office is in back.

401
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,208
Dinah, you take
cameras.

402
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,961
Mia, go distract
your fiancé.

403
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,630
You sure you're okay?

404
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,300
Yeah. It's
the strangest thing.

405
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:02,304
I have all these
memories of my old life,

406
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,973
but I have
my new ones, too.

407
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,060
I just really don't
want it to be him.

408
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,067
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

409
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,445
Oh, yeah. I was
starting to worry.

410
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,238
You left in a hurry
earlier.

411
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,990
Yeah, I wasn't
feeling well.

412
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,797
"Actually, I just remembered

413
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,368
"you were a dangerous
murderer,

414
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,912
<i>probably
a kidnapper, too."</i>

415
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,580
Hey, be nice, Laurel.

416
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,624
- I need a drink.
- Yeah?

417
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,792
- Yeah.
- Come on.

418
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,436
There's only
one guard at the door.

419
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,337
This should be easy.
Where are we on cameras?

420
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:36,880
Almost there.

421
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,256
In the meantime,

422
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,092
why don't we go back to
talking about Mia's love life?

423
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,469
Let's not.

424
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,970
You know I dated
your dad, right?

425
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,306
<i>Well, a version of him anyway.</i>

426
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,223
- Gross.
- Thank you.

427
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,935
<i>My Oliver also went down on the</i> Gambit,

428
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,561
also cheated with my sister.

429
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,938
Please
stop talking.

430
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,190
<i>People are who they are, Mia,</i>

431
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,567
no matter what timeline,
universe, or earth,

432
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,152
and that's not your fault.

433
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,047
Was that supposed to be
some kind of pep talk?

434
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,242
Cameras are down.

435
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:06,327
That's my cue.

436
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,662
This area
is restricted.

437
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,540
Oh, I'm just gonna
step out and get some air.

438
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,959
Trust me, I am not
an art thief.

439
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,565
Well, you're welcome
to step outside.

440
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,980
Okay, let's not cause
a scene here, Laurel.

441
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,942
- I'll do it.
<i>- Fine.</i>

442
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,096
No offense, Mia,

443
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,722
but if I couldn't
get in there,

444
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,559
do you really think
that you're gonna be able to just...

445
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,773
Oh, you were saying?

446
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,194
I'm in.
Now what do I need to do?

447
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,201
Just put the device
anywhere near the computer.

448
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,906
It'll transfer the data
from your search.

449
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,405
<i>It's working.</i>

450
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,945
Run a search for
the Bertinellis.

451
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,375
Maybe we'll get lucky.

452
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,464
Uh, something's wrong.

453
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,970
Mia, you need to get
out of there now.

454
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,183
Hey, step away
from the computer.

455
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,475
Mia, what are you
doing in here?

456
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,476
Where is she?

457
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,438
I'll take it
from here.

458
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,693
What is going on
with you?

459
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,236
You break into
my office,

460
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,654
and you hack
my computer?

461
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,197
I know you have Bianca.

462
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:28,657
That's what this
is about?

463
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,995
You think that I
kidnapped her?

464
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,248
Do you know how
crazy that sounds?

465
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,917
You're calling me
crazy now. Wow.

466
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,793
Because you are
being crazy.

467
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,378
Okay, if you have
nothing to hide,

468
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,905
then show me what's
in these files.

469
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:54,975
Our honeymoon.

470
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,144
You said that you always
wanted to visit Fiji.

471
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,273
I was hoping I
could surprise you.

472
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
<i>Namaste.</i>

473
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,031
Can I call you
crazy now?

474
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:11,576
- Bianca? What the hell?
<i>- Namaste.</i>

475
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,392
I have to get
back to the party.

476
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:14,995
Okay. Let me explain.

477
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:16,956
J...

478
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,942
Bianca looks pretty
happy to be kidnapped, don't you think?

479
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,843
Turn off your
socialite brain and use your gut.

480
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,971
Don't you think that video's
a little convenient?

481
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,782
I think whoever
posted that is trying

482
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,432
to keep people from
looking for Bianca.

483
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,049
We should analyze it,
you know,

484
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,536
see what clues we can
get in finding her.

485
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,771
Okay, I just accused my
fiancé for nothing.

486
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,106
Oh, he'll get over it.

487
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,193
Or you'll move on to someone who wasn't
a homicidal maniac in another life.

488
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,194
Win-win.

489
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:47,195
Oh, frak you.

490
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,340
Okay, that's enough.
I think we just need to calm down...

491
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,282
No. I am not the one
who cares more

492
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,659
about my relationship
problems

493
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,619
than my friend
who might die.

494
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,122
Do you not see how
selfish you're being?

495
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,458
Me? You're the one
who's using my friend

496
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,877
to drag me and Dinah back
into this superhero crap

497
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:06,589
just because you can't handle
the fact that Star City's fine

498
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,047
and doesn't need you to
be the Black Canary anymore.

499
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,386
And here I thought making
you remember your old life

500
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,347
would open your eyes to how
pointless and stupid

501
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:15,765
your new one is.

502
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,852
My "stupid and pointless"
life is the one that

503
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,937
my father sacrificed
himself to give me.

504
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,605
Don't you dare
trivialize that.

505
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,792
Okay, I think
all Laurel was trying to say

506
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,736
is that Bianca is out there,
and she's in danger.

507
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:27,901
Bianca is fine.

508
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,576
You had no right
to make me remember.

509
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,705
All that did is bring back
the suffering and the loss,

510
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,583
because that's
all being a hero is.

511
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,009
I would've met you at
your place.

512
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:52,886
I needed the drive.

513
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,641
I hope that I didn't screw up
your event too badly.

514
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,808
I wish it was just
the event that you'd screwed up.

515
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,228
JJ, I'm sorry.

516
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,065
You accused me of
kidnapping our friend.

517
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,466
How in the world do you think
I could do something like that?

518
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,904
You were keeping
things from me.

519
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,490
I guess I just jumped
to conclusions.

520
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,994
Jumping to conclusions is...
is I'm cheating on you,

521
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,161
not that I'm a kidnapper.

522
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,580
And for the record,
I'm neither.

523
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:21,748
I know that.

524
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,685
Can we please just go
back to a time

525
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,795
before I accused you
of being a criminal?

526
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,129
I get it now.

527
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,135
This never had anything
to do with Bianca.

528
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,179
What are you talking
about?

529
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,349
You have never really
had to commit to anything in your life.

530
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,435
That's why you brush off
your brother's job offers.

531
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,271
And it's why you hesitated
saying yes to our proposal.

532
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,607
It's why you're pushing me
away right now.

533
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,651
You don't want to
marry me.

534
00:26:49,652 --> 00:26:50,652
That is not true.

535
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,320
Then how come ever since
the party...

536
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,074
ever since I proposed
to you, i-it's like

537
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,988
you're seeing someone else
when you're looking at me?

538
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,670
When I look at you,
I see the rest of my life.

539
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,465
I can't marry someone
who doesn't feel the same.

540
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,300
- John, please.
- No. I... no.

541
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,846
I think it's best
we take some space.

542
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,646
We're running
out of time.

543
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,293
Please tell me you're close to finding
something on that video.

544
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:30,984
Our hunch was right.

545
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,920
There's evidence
the image was altered.

546
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,304
I'm running a decryption program,
but it's gonna take a bit.

547
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,032
Since when did you learn to do all
this Felicity stuff?

548
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,077
I was a police captain,
Laurel. I have tricks.

549
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,289
Like knowing when someone's
not telling me everything,

550
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,498
for example.

551
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,124
Like you.

552
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:48,792
What?

553
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,963
You've been pushing Mia
real hard, which is weird,

554
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,841
because normally, you keep a fairly
healthy snark-filled distance

555
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,593
from caring too much
about anything.

556
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,427
This is personal.

557
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,014
Look, I wasted
a lot of time

558
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,973
pretending to
be something I wasn't

559
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,934
because it was easier, and
I don't want Mia making the same mistake.

560
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,101
You...

561
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:10,190
You know, part of empathy isn't only
understanding other people's pain.

562
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,776
It's also sharing your own.
You know how hard it is to be a hero.

563
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,159
I mean, hell, I'm struggling
with it right now.

564
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,531
Imagine what she's
going through.

565
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,409
The last time Mia put on
that Green Arrow suit

566
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,036
was the day Oliver died.

567
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,248
The program's finished.

568
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,086
Oh, boy.

569
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,857
Whoever did this
wanted people to think

570
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,466
she was safe on vacation.

571
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,986
They didn't know they were
giving us a lead.

572
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,887
Well, thank God for morons.

573
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,654
I gotta figure
out where this is.

574
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,766
But for the record,
I think you're right.

575
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,851
If there is evil back
in Star City,

576
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,270
the Green Arrow
should be here, too.

577
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,494
Oh, God. Are you crying?

578
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,412
What the hell
are you doing here?

579
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,834
I guess it's that
feelings thing or whatever.

580
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,503
Look, I'm sorry.

581
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:17,757
JJ broke up with me,
if you even care.

582
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,049
I do care.

583
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,594
You're strong
enough to get through this.

584
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,073
You're strong enough to
get through anything. I've seen you do it.

585
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,348
Is that why you
woke me up?

586
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:35,024
Mia, I spent so much of my life
choosing the easy path.

587
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,736
And for me, that meant
becoming Black Siren

588
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,863
and destroying things
and...

589
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:43,408
killing people.

590
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,201
It's not a good look.

591
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,288
Not exactly
what I'm doing here.

592
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,791
Okay, but can you honestly
tell me that you were happy with your life

593
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,710
before I woke you up? Truly?

594
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:56,586
I spent my whole life

595
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,048
looking at these
pictures of my dad,

596
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,926
all of the amazing
things he did for the city,

597
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,262
what a hero he was,

598
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,849
wondering how I could
possibly live up to that

599
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,352
you know, in... in anything
I chose to do.

600
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,520
And...

601
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,735
and so I chose to do
nothing.

602
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:24,032
He would probably be
so disappointed in me.

603
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:25,866
I doubt that.

604
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,163
Your father, he wanted
you to be happy.

605
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,291
And he... he gave you
all this,

606
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,420
but I also think he wanted
you to have a choice.

607
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,548
I am not gonna
sugarcoat it for you.

608
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,052
Being a hero kind of sucks.

609
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,012
And it never gets
any easier

610
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,431
because it is the hardest thing
that you can do.

611
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,142
Then why do it?

612
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,102
For me, it gave me a purpose.

613
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,272
And that's why I woke you up,

614
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:00,026
so that you could have
the chance to realize your own.

615
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,029
Mia, this is your city,

616
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,406
and you're the Green Arrow.

617
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,705
Hey. How'd it go?

618
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,540
Ask her.

619
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,377
I'm glad you
decided to join.

620
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,505
Bianca's my friend. Any
luck finding her location?

621
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,508
Not yet. But she's in
a greenhouse of some sort.

622
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,676
Only problem is there
are hundreds in the city.

623
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:26,928
It's gonna take time.

624
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:30,014
That's not
a greenhouse.

625
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:31,349
The design's biophilic.

626
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,556
It's meant to power the
building photosynthetically.

627
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,770
What are you,
a botanist now?

628
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,104
I took a couple classes

629
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:39,065
in design theory
and sustainable concepts.

630
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,067
Socialites can have
brains, too.

631
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,528
Great.
Well, use your fancy brain

632
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:44,904
and narrow it
down for us?

633
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,990
Uh, there's about 12 buildings
in the city that fit the bill.

634
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,660
But only one of them
is currently unoccupied...

635
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,495
a complex downtown.

636
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:54,414
Let's go save my friend.

637
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,832
You sure you're
ready for this?

638
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,708
One way to find out.

639
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,928
Thermal imaging
places Bianca on the top floor.

640
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,335
There's 2 bodies beside her.
I'm guessing they're guards.

641
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,015
How much more company
can we expect?

642
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,382
It depends on how
fast we move.

643
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:15,518
That's comforting.

644
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,145
Oh, and another
piece of good news.

645
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,355
The whole place
is laced with meta-dampeners.

646
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,067
- So no Canary Cries.
- Perfect. Ready?

647
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,665
I so wish I got that
on my live stories.

648
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,125
We have to go now.

649
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,170
Why leave now, huh?

650
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:43,921
The fun is just
getting started.

651
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:45,839
Trevor.

652
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:50,470
You know my name.
I'm flattered.

653
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,764
Cool masks.

654
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,100
Yeah, very, uh, 2020.

655
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,895
Actually, I... I have...
I have one of my own.

656
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,891
So this is what you've been spending
Daddy's money on?

657
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,568
You know,
Bianca never told me that she had

658
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,988
such, uh,
colorful friends.

659
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,406
Oh, I get it.

660
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,826
She broke up with you,
and now your feelings are hurt.

661
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,411
- Aw.
- Aw.

662
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:16,738
Is that why
you're doing this?

663
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,372
Oh, don't flatter
yourself.

664
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,332
You're a pawn

665
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,585
with a fancy
family name.

666
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,146
That's the only reason
you're important.

667
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,421
Yeah, I see why
you dumped him.

668
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,065
- Enough talking.
- Great.

669
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,984
So I guess that means
you're waving the white flag.

670
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,638
The three of you
against all of us.

671
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,141
- I'll take those odds.
- So will we.

690
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:11,424

00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,658
Now what?

697
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,662
We're too high.

698
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,082
How are you
still alive?

699
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,548
Death by tantrum?
You're gonna have to do better than that.

700
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,301
Don't come any closer.

701
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,304
You see, all the, uh,

702
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:00,308
greenery in this building is linked
to the same system...

703
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:04,729
all state-of-the-art
and all very, very...

704
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,355
explosive.

705
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,636
If he drops that lighter,
this whole place is gonna go up.

706
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,193
Trevor, don't do this.

707
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,945
You can't stop
what's coming.

708
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,030
She won't let you.

709
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,449
And who the hell is she?

710
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,129
We have to jump.

711
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,256
I thought you were
trying to save me, not kill me.

712
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:33,632
Trust me.

713
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,185
Welcome back.

714
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,535
Oh, my God.
Who are you bitches?

715
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,812
<i>Any word
on how Bianca's doing?</i>

716
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,088
She is back to her old self,
posting live videos.

717
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,134
So I'm not very good at
this, uh, feelings stuff.

718
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,554
I wanted to thank you,
both of you.

719
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,933
And now you can go back
to your glamorous life

720
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,185
of singing to drunk
hipsters in your bar.

721
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,436
Oh, thank you for that.

722
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,856
But, uh, actually, I was
thinking of going part-time.

723
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,652
You know, Trevor's not just
a jealous ex-lover trying to get even.

724
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,195
Somebody pushed him
to do this,

725
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,280
and we still haven't
figured out who or why.

726
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,366
Trevor's tattoo
looked familiar.

727
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,117
We start there.

728
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:43,118
We?

729
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,081
Star City needs
the Green Arrow.

730
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,167
But what about JJ,
and what about your life?

731
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,419
I'm not giving that up,

732
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,213
but I'm also gonna protect
my father's legacy.

733
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,549
Mia, living a double life
is really hard.

734
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,509
Well, somebody once
told me that

735
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:01,554
being a hero is
the hardest thing you can do.

736
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:04,139
It's also
the right thing.

737
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,892
Well, that person
sounds really smart.

738
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,139
I mean, she has
her moments.

739
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,980
But putting on
that suit again wasn't easy.

740
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:14,316
But it reminded me
that it's not all bad.

741
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,529
There are some really,
really good parts, too.

742
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:24,452
Well, uh, before we get
back to saving the world,

743
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,662
I say we should have
a celebratory drink.

744
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,748
And after what we did
tonight,

745
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,708
I say we deserve
the good stuff.

746
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,794
Cheers. To the Green Arrow.

747
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,503
To the Canaries.

748
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,758
To the future,
whatever it holds.

749
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,426
Well, I'm glad you didn't
change the locks on me yet.

750
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:47,475
Mia...

751
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:50,728
Look, before you kick me out,
just please let me say I'm sorry.

752
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:56,066
You were right. I... I have been acting
weird since the graduation party.

753
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:58,569
- So then I did spook you.
- No.

754
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,155
This has nothing to do
with you proposing.

755
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,869
Look, graduating
got into my head.

756
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm trying to figure out what I want to do
with the rest of my life,

757
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,543
what kind of person
I want to be. I...

758
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,624
I want to help you with that.

759
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,426
And that is why I
love you so much.

760
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,845
You're a good
person, JJ.

761
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,849
I couldn't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

762
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,611
You know, it's been a while
since I had a roommate.

763
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,322
I'll get my own place,
I promise.

764
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:46,242
Your own place?
That sounds pretty permanent.

765
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,761
The city's under threat,
and I'm not gonna leave until it's over.

766
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,039
You know, while you're here,

767
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,333
we could turn this place
into a base of operations

768
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,458
for the Canaries.

769
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,045
Canaries, as in more
than just us?

770
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:03,092
Tonight made me remember
who I really am, Laurel.

771
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,470
I may have been erased,
but I'm not gone.

772
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,848
I need to figure out
how I got here.

773
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:12,810
And while I do that, I can help a whole
new generation of women.

774
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:18,065
So basically,
what you're saying is

775
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,942
that I was right.

776
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,986
Don't gloat.

777
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,905
But please do explain why
you didn't tell me

778
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,912
the whole story about what Bianca's death
would have meant for the city.

779
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,912
Sara said
when the city falls...

780
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,960
someone's at
the center of it... Mia.

781
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,670
But Bianca was dead
in the future,

782
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,255
and Mia wasn't
the Green Arrow.

783
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:43,995
We should be
in the clear, right?

784
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,010
I hope so.

785
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,213
I can't believe it's
been 20 years

786
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,771
since he sacrificed
himself to save the city.

787
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:01,691
Who's that?

788
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:04,738
Oh, just the <i>Star,</i>
the <i>Globe</i>, the <i>Gazette,</i>

789
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,447
<i>Byline</i>, channel 52.

790
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,374
They all want to know
if I'm the Green Arrow.

791
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,033
Course they do.

792
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:11,327
Isn't it a little
misogynistic

793
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,888
that they're not calling
you as well?

794
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,288
I mean, come on, guys.
It's 2040.

795
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:22,254
Oh, my God.
You brought the pet rock.

796
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,132
Excuse me.
Are you referring to the Hozen?

797
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:27,718
This is the closest thing
we have to a family heirloom,

798
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,763
passed down from Dad
to Aunt Thea to Mom and to me.

799
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,389
Show some respect,
please.

800
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,099
May I see it?

801
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,519
- Yes, you may.
- Thank you.

802
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:47,529
What the hell?

803
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:49,907
Oh.

804
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:55,161
William!

805
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,562
Hey, babe. I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

806
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,276
Who are you?
What do you want?

807
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,738
I need you to remember.

808
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,486
<i>I have vision.</i>

809
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:36,829
<i>We can fix this...</i>

810
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,998
<i>together.</i>

811
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,042
<i>JJ!</i>

812
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:46,338
<i>You were wrong
about me.</i>

813
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,675
<i>It was never a mask.</i>

814
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,208
Greg, move your head!
