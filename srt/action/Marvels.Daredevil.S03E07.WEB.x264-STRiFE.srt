1
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,140
The painting that's intended
for this wall

2
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,510
is something I am specially attached to.

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,680
Of course. Rabbit in a Snowstorm.

4
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,600
Yes, the agreement.

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,070
It said I was to get
all my belongings restored to me.

6
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,780
Precisely. And we might be able
to use this violation of terms

7
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,700
to lobby the feds for something else.

8
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,120
The painting!

9
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,540
That's what I'm interested in.

10
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,630
I can assure you we're doing
everything in our power, but...

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,590
there's a challenge
to your ownership claim.

12
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,850
It comes home.

13
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,110
Do you understand?

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,960
Lawyer's out! Cameras back on!

15
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,400
Wellers,
we have a situation. Report to the CP.

16
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,430
Shit.

17
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,770
Inside. Shut the door.

18
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,530
Show them to me.

19
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,660
All units
on the citywide, NYPD...

20
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,630
Shit. Are you hearing this?
What happened at the Bulletin?

21
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,260
We should be there,
not stuck here with this asshole.

22
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,430
He go to bed?

23
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,050
Turned in early.
Nice and cozy, while the world explodes.

24
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,640
And now the news, Mrs. Shelby.

25
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,190
...rushed to nearby hospitals
in critical condition.

26
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,110
But what we do know is that,
according to several eyewitnesses,

27
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,610
the brutal attack on the Bulletin staff

28
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,070
has been carried out
by none other than Daredevil.

29
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,620
The word from the witnesses
we've spoken with is that Daredevil,

30
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,410
Hell's Kitchen's renowned vigilante,
is the perpetrator.

31
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,160
...they don't know the whereabouts
of Daredevil or whether...

32
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,420
This brutal act hits Hell's Kitchen after
a period of relative calm in the city,

33
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,050
with the FBI arresting
many of New York's...

34
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,120
You're missing the point. He didn't
just find someone to wear my suit.

35
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,460
Someone as fast and skilled as I've
ever seen, and I couldn't take him.

36
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,920
- He found someone to kill me.
- Matthew...

37
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,550
I was stupid enough to think
that I had Fisk cornered.

38
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,220
He knew I'd find the witness,
and I just brought the sheep to slaughter.

39
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,550
Jasper Evans is dead.

40
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,300
He's dead and he leaves a son behind,
and that's on me!

41
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,680
I was so sure that I finally
was out in front of this bastard.

42
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,270
And Fisk, he knew I thought that.

43
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,730
- He was waiting for me.
- Matthew...

44
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,650
Foggy and Karen both could've been killed.

45
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,520
And there would have been nothing
I could have done to stop it. Nothing.

46
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,650
You're losing blood.
I need to stitch you up.

47
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,360
I listened to you.
I listened to you, and they almost died.

48
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,240
God damn it. I'm such an idiot.

49
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
No.

50
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm the idiot.

51
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,050
I told you to involve your friends,
and I made things worse.

52
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,390
I'm used to putting on a brave face when
people bring their troubles to the church.

53
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,390
And I find that they
don't just bring their troubles,

54
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,900
they bring their answers, too,
if you let them talk enough.

55
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,770
But...

56
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,490
what you're dealing with
is so far beyond my experience that...

57
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,530
Well...

58
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,500
all I can hope to do is help keep
your wounds stitched and your head clear,

59
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,460
so you can be safe.

60
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,840
And I'll be more careful
about giving advice to the Devil.

61
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,430
And, occasionally, possibly,
I'll try to keep my mouth shut.

62
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,180
Could I get that in writing?

63
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,140
Look, I know you were just trying to help.

64
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,860
Now, can I please see to those wounds?

65
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,510
Can I ask you something?

66
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,140
Yeah.

67
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,770
What if you stopped this fight,
took time to heal...

68
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,270
and let other people like you
go after Fisk?

69
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,030
This isn't their fight.

70
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,410
Fisk is my problem.

71
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,750
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

72
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,420
The problem is,
he's always five steps ahead of me.

73
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,300
I don't know if I can beat him.

74
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,340
And I don't know if I can beat
the man he sent to kill me.

75
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,720
You won't know for certain
till you find him.

76
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,190
I thought you were gonna keep
your thoughts to yourself.

77
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,360
- You really want me to do that?
- No.

78
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,450
If he was wearing
a copy of your Devil suit...

79
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,830
Well, he didn't get it at Sears.

80
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,790
How good a copy was it?

81
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,710
It was perfect.

82
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,270
Hello, Karen.
It's nice to see you again.

83
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,900
Was there anyone else
in the room named Karen?

84
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,650
Or on the whole Bulletin staff?

85
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,280
I'm advising my client
not to answer any questions

86
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,990
that treat her like an asshole.

87
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,080
There was not.
He was talking to you.

88
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,580
- Why don't we watch it again? See...
- No.

89
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,840
- He was talking to me. That's true.
- Okay.

90
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,550
- Good.
- But I've never met him before.

91
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Well, according to your own newspaper,
you've met Daredevil at least twice.

92
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,310
That psycho's not Daredevil.

93
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,180
I got a pretty good look at him, too.

94
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,850
Could have fooled me.

95
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,650
Do you think every fat guy with
a white beard and red suit is Santa Claus?

96
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,440
If he comes down my chimney
and leaves presents under the tree.

97
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,780
Exactly. If he acted like Santa.
This guy doesn't act like Daredevil.

98
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,450
Based on your two encounters?

99
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,120
Dig a little deeper.

100
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,370
Why don't you read everything?

101
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,790
He doesn't kill people, ever.
It's not Daredevil.

102
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,460
So you keep saying.

103
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,580
Did you ever look into Felix Manning?
Red Lion Bank?

104
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,710
Any of the leads
that I dropped in your lap?

105
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,720
They're on my to-do list.

106
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,340
This is bullshit.

107
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,760
He dropped your name, Ms. Page.

108
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,100
Used your gun to murder someone.

109
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,600
And in this entire shitshow,

110
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,440
you're the one person
he didn't lay a finger on.

111
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,690
So I'm sorry that you think
that this is bullshit,

112
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,480
but something doesn't add up.

113
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,820
So we're gonna keep
going over this until it does.

114
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,030
It's not gonna add up until you start
asking the right questions.

115
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,990
How about this one? Where's Matt Murdock?

116
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,910
Yet another fine example of a question
that's besides the friggin' point!

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,790
You were supposed to deliver him,
Mr. Nelson.

118
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,040
But there are zero Matt Murdocks
in my custody.

119
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,380
Zero Jasper Evans left alive.

120
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,220
Think that's random?
He kills the one guy with dirt on Fisk.

121
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,890
You know that already?
Is that why you don't wanna go there?

122
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,970
- Karen...
- What?

123
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,770
That psycho in a suit
did Agent Nadeem a huge favor.

124
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,570
Now there's no one left to tell the world
what a fool Fisk is making of the FBI.

125
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,950
Did you know Daredevil
was gonna attack the Bulletin?

126
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,750
Is that why you brought
your gun last night?

127
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,580
Okay. We're done here.

128
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,220
Are you okay?

129
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,390
No, I'm definitely not okay.

130
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,440
None of the people who own those phones
are okay, either.

131
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,570
- Come on. Let's go.
- No...

132
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,780
I don't get it. You... You almost died.
That doesn't leave a mark?

133
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,370
I don't have time to think about that.

134
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,410
Right now,
Agent Nadeem's got all my attention.

135
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,290
If he digs into Jasper Evans, he'll know
we're telling the truth about Fisk.

136
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,710
Then he'll dig into the rest of it.
I hope.

137
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,480
I did this.

138
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,600
Wilson Fisk did this.

139
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,150
Evans wouldn't have come to the Bulletin
if I hadn't threatened his son.

140
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,070
This isn't on you.

141
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,360
And this isn't the time
to give up the fight.

142
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,490
- We need to find Matt...
- No. Um...

143
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,330
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

144
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,450
Are you hurt?

145
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,410
I'm the only one who wasn't.

146
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,460
Marci. I should take this. She's worried.

147
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,390
Hey, babe.

148
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,760
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

149
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,640
I know. I'm sorry, it's just been crazy.
The time has...

150
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,980
Seema, I'm fine.

151
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Really, I...

152
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,030
Seems, I wasn't even there.

153
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,490
I got there after it was all over.

154
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,530
That's right.

155
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,370
I'll be home tonight, okay?

156
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,210
Oh, shit. That's tonight?

157
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,090
No. No, no. Don't cancel. Um...

158
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,140
It'll be good to see the family.

159
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,390
And good for Sami, you know?

160
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,060
And let him know
everything really is all right.

161
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,480
I love you, too.

162
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,240
Where is he?

163
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,160
- Damn, it's cold out here.
- You got your hat?

164
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,330
I could get your hat.

165
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,740
No, Melvin, it's okay.
I'm in the office today.

166
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,830
Okay.

167
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,930
I made you cheese and pickles.

168
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,970
Thanks, love.

169
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,100
- You got your gun?
- Of course. Right here.

170
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
What's going on?

171
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,230
You've been acting strange all morning.

172
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,310
I...

173
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,060
worry about you.

174
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,520
Because I hang out
with paroled cons like you?

175
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,230
'Cause they're not like me.

176
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,000
I can take care of myself,
big man.

177
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,120
You be good today.
I'll make asopao for dinner.

178
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,240
Okay.

179
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Love you.

180
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,300
Betsy's your parole officer.

181
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,560
Please don't tell anyone.
It's against the rules.

182
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,140
I don't care
what you do with Betsy, Melvin.

183
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,440
You know why I'm here.

184
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,480
Fisk made me make the suit.

185
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,270
Did that man hurt you?

186
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,320
I'm sorry.

187
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,530
Who was he?

188
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,240
He didn't tell me his name.

189
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,530
But I can make you a new one...
to protect you against him.

190
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,290
- It'd be a fair fight.
- I don't want the suit anymore.

191
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,160
You don't like it?

192
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,960
I've outgrown what it stood for.

193
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,750
When you made my suit,
there were molds, measurements.

194
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,590
At the workshop, maybe there's something.

195
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,180
I've been to the workshop.
It's been burned down.

196
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,510
Yeah, I burned it down,
because I didn't want to help Fisk, but...

197
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,850
he made me a new shop
and he threatened Betsy.

198
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,650
People died
because you helped him, Melvin.

199
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

200
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,950
Where is your new shop?

201
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,530
Foggy Bear?

202
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,830
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

203
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,670
When did you get here?

204
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,750
I tried to stay awake.
I've been watching the news all night.

205
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,210
Are you hurt?

206
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,300
Babe, talk to me.

207
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,720
I'm okay.

208
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,060
I'm just tired.

209
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,610
Let's get you to bed.

210
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,610
Babe?

211
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,140
Jasper Evans.

212
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,510
Locked up in '91
on a couple of murder two counts.

213
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,560
Seems he walked into a convenience store,
got talked to the wrong way,

214
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,230
ended up shooting an honest cashier

215
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,400
and a sweet old granny
picking up her Sunday Powerball ticket.

216
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,990
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

217
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,860
Warden, this lifer
was supposed to be serving

218
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,240
a year in the hole
for shanking Wilson Fisk.

219
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
Is that a question?

220
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,870
How could he be in the hole and get killed
in a newspaper office at the same time?

221
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,920
Some pencil-pusher must've checked
the wrong box and let him out by mistake.

222
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,130
Look. I'm not trying to jam you up.

223
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,590
I'm just trying to nail down
how he got out.

224
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,510
And who might have wanted him dead.

225
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,140
I need answers, Warden.

226
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,810
You got nothing? Seriously?

227
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,320
I want my lawyer.

228
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,990
I talked to the Bulletin reporter.

229
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,250
Jasper Evans was going to say
that Fisk staged his own shanking.

230
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,080
He had him released
from prison as payback.

231
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,170
Jesus.

232
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,170
Tell me the warden disputes that.

233
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,510
He's more concerned
with covering his own ass.

234
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,170
- He's lawyered up.
- Oh, shit.

235
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,140
It's all hearsay.
I mean, Evans might have been lying.

236
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,970
And maybe he was telling the truth.

237
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,310
We gotta kick this up the chain.

238
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,980
- Who are you calling?
- The ADIC.

239
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,190
And tell him what?
We don't know all the facts.

240
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,530
Except there's a damn good chance
that Fisk is manipulating us.

241
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,410
If it's true,

242
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,580
every asshole we put away with Fisk's help
will be back on the street by morning.

243
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,210
Everything we've done,
the people we've lost,

244
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,840
it will all be for nothing.

245
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,170
You can't unring that bell.

246
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,380
Just give me a chance
to figure out if it's true.

247
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,590
How?

248
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,310
I need two days.

249
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,720
You want a pony, too?

250
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,350
Just let me get the facts.

251
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,060
If Fisk really did play us,

252
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,520
we'll bury that son of a bitch together.

253
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Wow.

254
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,160
I don't know what got into me.

255
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,330
It's okay.

256
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,790
I mean, it was way, way better than okay.

257
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,130
Like, way better.

258
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,380
I mean, I get it.

259
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,590
After what you went through last night.

260
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,220
I was convinced I was gonna die.

261
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,720
The last thing I remember thinking was,
"Not yet."

262
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,890
Oh, you must've been so scared.

263
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,770
More than I've ever been
in my entire life.

264
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,940
But there was something else beneath it.
This feeling of being unsettled.

265
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,950
Important things left undone.

266
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,450
Marry me.

267
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,080
- Stop.
- I'm serious.

268
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,670
- Let's go to the courthouse right now.
- Foggy Bear, slow down.

269
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,250
I love you, Marci, and I'm pretty sure
that you love me, too.

270
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,840
I do love you.

271
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,550
But when you propose,
I want it to be from your heart.

272
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,220
Not from this.

273
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,190
Shit.

274
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,690
I'm gonna be late for my deposition.

275
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,200
Go. Shower. I'll pick this up.

276
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,600
What the hell?

277
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,780
Think about what Amber
would have wanted. You know?

278
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,700
They want to take her off
of life support.

279
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,700
I'll let you know what we decide.

280
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,240
Okay. I'm so sorry.

281
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,710
I'm...

282
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,840
All surgical residents to pre-op.

283
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
All surgical residents to pre-op.

284
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,260
Chief ortho resident to ER.
Chief ortho resident to ER.

285
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,140
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

286
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,270
How are you feeling?

287
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,810
I'm full of Percocet.

288
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,940
Jell-O.

289
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,570
Rage.

290
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Uh...

291
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Amber?

292
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,030
Oh, she's on...

293
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,290
She's brain-dead.
Just, uh, machines keeping her alive.

294
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,540
- It wasn't worth it.
- Karen...

295
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,050
Look, three people died.

296
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,630
Why? Because I had to pick a fight?

297
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,300
I'm pretty sure
that's what we're supposed to do.

298
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,680
Sometimes, we get our asses kicked.

299
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,010
Could you get me the water?
It's over there.

300
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,480
Don't think you have some proprietary
claim over sticking it to Fisk.

301
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,230
You know, this fight belongs
to every person in Hell's Kitchen.

302
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,610
And I'm one of them,
so I intend to keep fighting.

303
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,870
We're gonna go to print today, tomorrow,
and the next day and the next day.

304
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,040
Here. I want you to write down
everything you know about Daredevil.

305
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,170
His connection to Fisk.

306
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,710
The man who attacked us last night,
it wasn't Daredevil.

307
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,430
Who was it, then?

308
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,930
I don't know.

309
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,770
But you know it wasn't Daredevil.

310
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,440
Karen, do you know who Daredevil is?

311
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,200
Don't ask me that. Please.

312
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,370
Why not?

313
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,920
Karen, if you know something,
you've gotta tell me right now.

314
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,840
I can't.

315
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,600
Some piece of shit attacked my people,
in my house!

316
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,930
And if you know anything,

317
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,730
anything that will get me closer
to finding out who he is,

318
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,150
then, God damn it,
you are going to tell me!

319
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,110
Or you can go clean out your desk.

320
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,920
Why is the suit here?

321
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,670
That's not the one he wore.
Fisk made me make two.

322
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,800
Why?

323
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,930
- Ask him yourself.
- What are you doing?

324
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,720
I have to go now. He said.

325
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,430
- Don't do this.
- I don't have a choice.

326
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,350
He'll come for Betsy.

327
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,190
Why'd he ask you to trap me here?
Is he coming? Tell me who wore the suit!

328
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,950
I will find him.
I will put an end to this.

329
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,360
I can't. Fisk will know.
And he'll hurt Betsy.

330
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
If you really loved her,
you'd cut her loose.

331
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,110
This life doesn't work with Betsys.

332
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,240
I can't let you leave!

333
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,510
- Someone's coming.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

334
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,570
It's the FBI, Melvin.
Why would Fisk send...

335
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,820
They're supposed to find you
with the suit.

336
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,660
Oh, God.

337
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,290
He's framing me for being Daredevil.
Oh, God.

338
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,040
Melvin, come on, he's tricking you.

339
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,460
Please. Betsy's all I have.

340
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,590
Once Fisk has me, he will kill you both.

341
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,470
- Oh, man.
- You gotta help me, or Betsy's dead.

342
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,930
Who did you make the suit for?

343
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,310
He never told me his name...

344
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,940
but he was an FBI agent.

345
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,190
How do you know that?

346
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,650
He was talking about it
with the man who brought him.

347
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,780
Breach. Breach. Breach.

348
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,400
FBI! Don't move!

349
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,530
Go! Go! Go!

350
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,580
Stop fighting, or we'll shoot!

351
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,630
Hands behind your head.

352
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,260
- Please! I gotta get to her!
- On your knees.

353
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
On your knees!

354
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,180
Betsy!

355
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,060
He'll hurt Betsy!

356
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,480
- He asleep?
- Been in bed all night.

357
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,650
I need to talk to him.

358
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,110
- You want company?
- No. I got it.

359
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,200
Potter's in custody.

360
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,620
Should we alter his situation
or his girlfriend's?

361
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,710
No.

362
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,380
He's irrelevant now.

363
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,590
Where is Poindexter?

364
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,140
Laying low, as ordered.

365
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,430
Although, I'm concerned
about his mental stability.

366
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,510
Yeah.

367
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,940
I've demanded a lot from him.

368
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,560
You keep an eye on him.

369
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,780
But let him be for now.

370
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,990
We need to talk.

371
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,080
You're working late.

372
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,750
Shouldn't you be with your family?
Seema, isn't it?

373
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,910
Say her name again and see what happens.

374
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,880
What can I help you with?

375
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,430
Help me.

376
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,510
You know, you remind me of someone
I knew growing up.

377
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,270
Jack Kem.

378
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,520
Yeah, but everyone knew him as Jiggy.

379
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,440
You know, Jiggy lived
in a two-family house all by himself.

380
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,480
It was practically a mansion to me.

381
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,860
But Jiggy was a helper, too.

382
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,370
He was always
helping out folks on the block.

383
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,580
Annie the single mom needs a new car.
Jiggy's got it.

384
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,620
The Hoffmans are desperate for rent.
No problem.

385
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,170
Ten-year-old me
thought this guy was a hero.

386
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,340
But it turned out
Jiggy had hidden ten kilos of heroin

387
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,010
in the trunk of Annie's sedan.

388
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,520
Another five in the Hoffman baby's room.

389
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,310
Guess who the cops arrested
when they tracked down that powder?

390
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,110
I've seen your kind of help before.

391
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,080
Have a little faith in me,
Special Agent Nadeem.

392
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,710
I'm a better man than Jiggy.

393
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,130
This...

394
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,340
All of this...

395
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,510
This was my price,

396
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,810
which I was plain about
at the start of our relationship.

397
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,060
And you have paid it.

398
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,240
I need to know.

399
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,780
Right now.

400
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,160
You let Jasper Evans out of prison
to pay him back for shanking you?

401
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,630
Your desperation diminishes you,
Special Agent.

402
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,300
Good night.

403
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,190
"The Hero of Hell's Kitchen
Feeds a Simpleton to the Feds."

404
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,110
Won't that make a hell of a headline
for tomorrow's Bulletin?

405
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,860
Melvin made his choice.

406
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,030
Yet you did hesitate before you left.

407
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,660
Were you waiting for a messenger
from the Lord to stop you,

408
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,370
like he stopped Abraham
from killing his son?

409
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,080
Were you disappointed
no messenger arrived...

410
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:40,170
or relieved that you didn't have to risk
your life for a weak-minded criminal?

411
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,520
You're not strong enough
to beat the man I sent for you.

412
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,810
You're not smart enough to beat me.

413
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,150
You couldn't do it alone.
You couldn't do it with your friends.

414
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,030
Your father never knew when to lay down.

415
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,820
He was too proud.

416
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,120
You will die the same way.

417
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,390
Please, Betsy, don't do me like this.

418
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,600
I wasn't the one who violated parole.
You did this to yourself.

419
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,900
Betsy.

420
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,740
Don't. I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here about Melvin.

421
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,120
Melvin Potter?

422
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,830
He's been arrested.

423
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,910
Bullshit.

424
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,040
He's not gonna tell anyone
about your relationship,

425
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,960
but that's not
what you need to worry about.

426
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,420
You need to worry about Wilson Fisk.

427
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,250
Oh, shit. Damn it, Melvin.

428
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,130
Fisk doesn't leave loose ends.
He will kill you.

429
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,800
Don't go home. Don't go back to work.
Leave town.

430
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,590
What about Melvin? Is he okay?

431
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,050
You can't help Melvin.

432
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,640
He made his bed
when he went back to work for Fisk.

433
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,520
You're a cold piece of work, aren't you?

434
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,730
Melvin told me
about the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

435
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,730
He thought you were a hero.

436
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,990
I told him assholes like you and Fisk
are cut from the same cloth

437
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,320
and both of you
would take advantage of Melvin

438
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,990
because he has a good heart
and a trusting way!

439
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,580
You've been warned, Betsy.

440
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,620
You want to live?

441
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,710
Run.

442
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Foggy?

443
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,770
Foggy, baby, are you okay?

444
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,440
Because I don't think you're okay.

445
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
Oh.

446
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,990
I'm... I'm fine.

447
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,200
I think I know what Fisk is up to.

448
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,170
Hello?

449
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,260
- Hi, Dad. It's me.
- Karen? Good Lord.

450
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,350
I heard something on the news.
That wasn't where you work, was it?

451
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,440
Yeah. Yeah, it was. I'm okay, though.

452
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,990
I was thinking that maybe
I could come home for a little while.

453
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,450
I don't know.
I'm afraid the timing is not great.

454
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,580
Yeah. Of course. I get it.

455
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,170
But you can call anytime, all right?

456
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,010
Dad...

457
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,260
I was just trying to do the right thing.
It just...

458
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,390
It went all wrong.

459
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,390
That's what you do, Karen.

460
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,110
Good night.

461
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,800
I'm not asking for prisoner files.

462
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,130
All I want is footage
from the security cameras. Copies.

463
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,430
I'll even pay for them.

464
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,560
We're supposed to be
on the same side here.

465
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,020
All I want to do is see exactly
what happened when Fisk got shanked.

466
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,860
Well, you have him call me
as soon as he gets in. Understand?

467
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,530
I'll...

468
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,780
Asshole.

469
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,800
Surprise!

470
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,430
Wow.

471
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,510
Congratulations
on your promotion, nuuri.

472
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Thanks, everyone.

473
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,890
Hey, bud. Come here.

474
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,860
Sorry I'm late.

475
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:42,950
Ray, you make every single person
in this room so proud.

476
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,040
Proud of the man you are
and who you strive to be.

477
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,370
For the example you set for our son.

478
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,000
For the husband and friend we adore.

479
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,710
And for being the man
who hogs more blankets at night

480
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,340
than is humanly possible.

481
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,930
But even with that, you've always been
the person to warm my heart.

482
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,690
Congratulations
on your well-deserved promotion.

483
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,270
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

484
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,310
- I love you.
- I love you.

485
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Eww.

486
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,440
Way to kill the moment, buddy.

487
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,570
Mom, we're out of soda.

488
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,950
There's plenty
in the fridge downstairs.

489
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,070
I'll get it.

490
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,240
I need a moment with you first.

491
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,750
What?

492
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,760
- I told you, everything is fine.
- You lied to me.

493
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,550
I called you, afraid for your life,
and you lied.

494
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,800
I have to hear from Annie Wellers
what really happened?

495
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,970
That that murderer attacked you
and that you shot him?

496
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,890
- Seems...
- I have to hear it from her?

497
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,860
- I didn't want you to worry.
- Well, I am worried.

498
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,730
I'm worried what this job
is doing to you, to us.

499
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,320
What's that supposed to mean?

500
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,280
I will always have your back.
To them. To everyone.

501
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,410
But I'm not an idiot.

502
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,330
- I didn't say you are.
- When you lie to my face, you do.

503
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,720
You're right.

504
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,140
I'm just trying
to keep everything together.

505
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,560
I don't want to screw any of this up.

506
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,730
I worked so hard for this, for us.

507
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,700
How... How can I fix this?

508
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,870
You can start with telling me the truth.

509
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,120
And by getting more drinks.

510
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,580
I didn't come here to fight.

511
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,880
Who are you?

512
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,630
I'm Daredevil.

513
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,720
The real one.

514
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,860
- You don't look like...
- I buried the red suit.

515
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,740
The man who attacked the Bulletin,
he resurrected it.

516
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,670
You do, however, match the description
of a guy who's been tuning up FBI agents.

517
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,170
Which is the last thing I ever wanted,
but you people haven't left me any choice.

518
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,430
If you'd just wake the hell up instead
of playing right into Fisk's hands.

519
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,180
He's using you, and I think you know it.

520
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,980
Now, I heard you confront
that psycho at the Bulletin.

521
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,020
I heard you try to stop him,
and he almost killed you, too.

522
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,310
So let me ask you this, Agent Nadeem...

523
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,690
Who do you think is the danger here?

524
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Me...

525
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,530
or him?

526
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,040
Dad, Mom wants to know
where you are.

527
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,080
Don't come down, Sami.

528
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,380
I dropped a beer, there's glass.

529
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,090
Tell your mom I need
a couple of minutes to clean it up.

530
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,170
Okay.

531
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,850
Let's say I believe the guy
that just broke into my house.

532
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,310
Let's just say that.

533
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,810
What do you got?

534
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,440
The man who attacked the Bulletin
dressed as Daredevil...

535
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,570
he's in the FBI.

536
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,500
Keep talking.
