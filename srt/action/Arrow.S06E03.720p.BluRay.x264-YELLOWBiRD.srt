1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,244
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,206
<i>After five years in hell,
I returned home with only one goal,</i>

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,961
<i>to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,258
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment</i>

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,382
<i>and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son.</i>

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,429
<i>So I asked the best man I know
to help.</i>

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,052
<i>His name is John Diggle,</i>

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,976
<i>and he is the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,182
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,059
Our old friend, Alex Faust.

11
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,442
<i>Okay, clearly, he was at SCPD
when the explosion went off.</i>

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,611
- So he either died or escaped.
<i>- He escaped.</i>

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,358
Special Agent Samanda Watson.

14
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,689
Can we help you with something?

15
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,025
I'm here as a courtesy to inform you
of the investigation

16
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,325
I'll be conducting in your city.

17
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,243
- Investigation into what?
- You.

18
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,955
The present us is only worried about

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,873
you quitting your
nobody-told-you-about job.

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,292
When are you gonna let that go?

21
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,461
- When you go into business with me.
- I'm sorry. Go into what with you?

22
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,539
- Think about all the good we could do.
- Yes.

23
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,045
On Lian Yu, Felicity and I got caught
in one of the explosions.

24
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,376
- I thought you guys were fine.
<i>- I have nerve damage.</i>

25
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,586
<i>That's why you haven't been
pulling your gun.</i>

26
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,138
<i>It's just a tremor,
I can manage it.</i>

27
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,725
You nearly got killed last night
because you couldn't rely on me.

28
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,893
But what are you gonna do about it?

29
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,970
Tell Oliver.

30
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,523
Eyes on Faust.

31
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,318
Shoot her!

32
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,329
I got him.
He's in the structure next door.

33
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,535
Everyone, get into position.

34
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,618
<i>- Copy that.
- On it, hoss.</i>

35
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:28,703
<i>You got it.</i>

36
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,763
Hurry! Hurry!

37
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,472
Down for the count.

38
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,762
No more bombs for you, bitch.

39
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,842
Go, Green Arrow.

40
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,893
Should I call you the Green Arrow?
It feels kinda weird.

41
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,061
It's weird.

42
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,356
But, at some point,
we all have to get used to it.

43
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,069
Seemed to go well out there tonight.

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,404
Yeah, we make a good team.

45
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,747
And yet you still have worried face.

46
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,040
Because sooner or later,

47
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,206
someone is gonna find out
that the Green Arrow

48
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,628
isn't shooting any arrows.

49
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,455
<i>Yeah, well, Curtis and I
are working on that.</i>

50
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,756
We're gonna figure something out.

51
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,333
Good. Thank you.

52
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,417
Okay.

53
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,338
I'm gonna go home.
I'm going to sleep,

54
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,138
and maybe I'll even get four hours.

55
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,389
Maybe in another week,

56
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,937
I'll get used to that
judgmental stare you keep giving me.

57
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,765
This isn't judgment.

58
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,933
It's amusement.

59
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,727
"Sooner or later
someone's gonna find out

60
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,528
"the Green Arrow
isn't shooting any arrows."

61
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,855
Dinah, I'm not an archer.

62
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,692
No, it's not about the arrows, John,
it's about the injury.

63
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,776
Thought you were
gonna talk to Oliver.

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,860
I was.

65
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,863
Until he asked me to put this on.

66
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,823
Which he never would have done
if he knew the truth.

67
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,534
Dinah, what do you want from me?

68
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,120
The man's under the FBI microscope,
he's worried about his son.

69
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,456
Imagine how worried he would be if he
knew you were out there compromised.

70
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,540
Did you see me tonight?

71
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,918
Did I look compromised?

72
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,049
Dinah, I have this handled.

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,676
The tremor's gone.

74
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,468
Well, I guess I worried
for nothing, then.

75
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,651
Good morning.

76
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,732
Morning.

77
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,909
You like your eggs scrambled, right?

78
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:06,986
Yes, I do.

79
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,288
Good. It's what I made you.

80
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,872
This is for real, for real, isn't it?

81
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,122
Me being around more?

82
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,669
And not the other guy.

83
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,503
It is for real, for real.

84
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,550
That's cool with you?

85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,586
Yeah.

86
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,421
Good.

87
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,340
What you got there?

88
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,425
Math.

89
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,885
Big test later this week.

90
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,428
Yeah, I know
what it's like switching schools.

91
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,979
Don't worry about it,
you'll get there.

92
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,476
Not by the end of this week.

93
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,225
I will be lucky to get a C.

94
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,185
Nothing wrong with getting a C
every once in a while.

95
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,236
I used to get Ds,
I would've been psyched for a C.

96
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,439
You don't get it.

97
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,522
Buddy, I'm kidding.

98
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,984
I think if you relax
a little more, it'll come easier.

99
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,319
I got to study. Can I be excused?

100
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,780
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

101
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:51,864
Yeah.

102
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,962
Hey. You all right?

103
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,087
Yeah. No. William is stressing
over a test.

104
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,340
I tried to be supportive,
but I feel like I just...

105
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,423
Making it worse.

106
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,350
I feel your pain.
That was Dinah's department.

107
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,052
I don't know what I would've done
parenting alone.

108
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,851
Uh... I mean,
you'll figure it out, though.

109
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,931
Thank you.

110
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,820
Agent Watson, I do not believe
you're on my schedule.

111
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,447
I think you'll come to find
I really don't give a damn.

112
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,524
Okay.

113
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,029
Your office issued a statement

114
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,361
on last night's apprehension
of Alex Faust.

115
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,697
We did. He was apprehended
by the Green Arrow.

116
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,541
And I'm sure you have
an airtight alibi for last night.

117
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,084
Rockets game with my kid.

118
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,620
We were on the jumbotron.

119
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,375
And only an idiot
of the highest order

120
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,548
would be fooled by someone else
running around in that hood.

121
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,463
<i>Whoever your understudy is,</i>

122
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,169
he might want to brush up
on his archery.

123
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,799
Or did you think we didn't notice

124
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,926
that no arrows were used
in taking down Faust?

125
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,258
- Are you done? Okay.
- I'm not.

126
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,968
<i>Whether I can prove
you're the Green Arrow,</i>

127
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,349
<i>there's no question
you support him as mayor.</i>

128
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,015
You're known to protect and
communicate with him and his team.

129
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,099
Is that a crime?

130
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,559
No.

131
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,361
But you're sending a message
to the police of this city

132
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,564
that they can't do their job
without vigilante help.

133
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,617
I'm glad I don't work for you.

134
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,534
She's not wrong.

135
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,995
About the "Glad she don't
work for me" part?

136
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,547
Or the "Nobody is buying
John in the hood" part?

137
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,169
The "undercutting the cops" part.

138
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,876
I know they're not enough
for this city,

139
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,882
but they never will be
if we keep saying it.

140
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,713
Well, it's a catch-22, Quentin.

141
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,339
I mean,

142
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,759
can you try to find a solution?

143
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,936
Yeah. I'll try.

144
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,012
<i>Thank you.</i>

145
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,223
It would be nice to have something
before John and the team

146
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,728
have to get back in the field.

147
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,150
Hey, I'll be back in five.

148
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,622
Uh...

149
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,823
Guys?

150
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,750
Yeah, we heard you. You'll be...

151
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,827
What the...

152
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,031
Officer Lopez.

153
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,784
Hope you don't own
any Kord Industries stock.

154
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,244
My pension fund does.

155
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,500
Though it seems a little crass
to worry about that now.

156
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,580
What do we got?

157
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,008
The vics all died of broken vertebrae
or blunt force trauma.

158
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,926
- Forensics?
- Not even a fingerprint.

159
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,800
And speaking of, the UnSub used
one of the vics' palm prints

160
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,882
to gain access
into Kord's internal server.

161
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,555
- To get what?
- The company doesn't know yet.

162
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,511
I'm gonna need a chat with the CEO.

163
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,897
In the meantime,
I'm gonna take a look around here.

164
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,143
You get all that?

165
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,937
Yeah. And a bag of chips.

166
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,647
Sorry, I didn't get a chance
to eat breakfast this morning,

167
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,731
I'm feeling a little peckish.

168
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,988
Ten will get you 20, the Kord CEO
won't tell you anything.

169
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,239
<i>Can you access the server?</i>

170
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,865
Already here. Now what?

171
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,822
<i>Okay, you're looking
for a master port.</i>

172
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,327
<i>Female with a yellow border.</i>

173
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,826
- Got it.
- Okay.

174
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,003
Insert our toy
and let us do our thang.

175
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,796
You keep saying "thing" wrong.

176
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,173
All right, we're in.
Curtis has got it from here.

177
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,300
- You going somewhere?
- I got start-up work to do.

178
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,131
Yeah, we're still trying
to decide on our name.

179
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:43,308
Hey, so I think I have a solution
to our cops' catch-22.

180
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,722
That was fast.

181
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,266
<i>I was chatting
with Councilwoman Pollard.</i>

182
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,188
She is in the early stages
of drafting

183
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,770
some anti-vigilante legislation.

184
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,071
- No.
<i>- Hear me out.</i>

185
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,444
<i>If you were to join it, sponsor it...</i>

186
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,524
Still no.

187
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,575
You could tailor the bill
to however you want it.

188
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,655
You could take the teeth out of it,
so it can't bite the team too hard.

189
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,786
Okay, first,
Pollard is not a pushover,

190
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,957
so we know this isn't true.

191
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,162
Second, I am not going
to put John in a hood

192
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,711
<i>and then actively support legislation
that furthers brands him as a criminal.</i>

193
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,917
Find another way. Please.

194
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,305
- Hi.
- Hey.

195
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,853
City Hall is six blocks that way.

196
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,522
I thought maybe you could
use a late afternoon snack.

197
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,771
Who are you, my mother?
I mean, that's not even accurate.

198
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,648
My mother rarely remembered
to pick me up from school,

199
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,274
let alone make me a snack.

200
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,907
- May I come in?
- Yeah.

201
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,817
Yeah.

202
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,661
I, uh, love what you've done
with the place.

203
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,367
Yeah, well, you know,

204
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,124
it's near impossible to find
affordable office space in the city,

205
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,830
someone should
talk to the mayor about that.

206
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,632
Oh, speaking of, how do you feel
about the name,

207
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,549
"Bit By Bit"?

208
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,347
Sounds like a sitcom from the '80s.

209
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,176
Great. That's like,
really not what we're going for.

210
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,055
Well, who knew, when you stopped
balancing being vigilante

211
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:11,688
with everything else, that you
would have time to drop off snacks.

212
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,561
Speaking of, how is William,

213
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,692
now that you're done pulling double
vigilante daddy duty?

214
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,275
It's a two-steps forward,
one-step backwards sort of thing.

215
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,115
I was just thinking I would really love
to be able to lean on Thea.

216
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,529
But, um...

217
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,703
I mean, she just has a knack
for this sort of thing.

218
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,955
Yeah, she would be
the most badass aunt ever.

219
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,411
Would she ever.

220
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,586
Well, I know I'm not Thea,

221
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,539
but I'm so down to help
in any way you need.

222
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,920
Well, truth be told,
aside from snacks,

223
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,503
- I do sort of need your help.
- Ah.

224
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,471
William has a math test
later this week

225
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,015
that he is really
stressing out over and, um...

226
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,103
Every time I open my mouth,
I'm making it worse.

227
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,932
So the man who took down Damien Darhk
is bested by arithmetic.

228
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,641
Wasn't my strongest subject
in school.

229
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,976
No? What was? Truancy?

230
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,811
Charm.

231
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,604
Yeah, no doubt.

232
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,617
Let me guess, you told him
something along the lines of,

233
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,616
"Just relax, I would've been psyched
to get a C, all I got was Fs."

234
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,947
Ds, I mean, most...

235
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,574
How did you know that?

236
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,251
'Cause I know you,
and I know that if you

237
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,416
even cared about school,
you would've been good at it.

238
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,964
- Thank you.
- Nothing would grind my gears more

239
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,134
when I was his age when my mom was
just telling me to stop worrying

240
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,132
when I was freaking out
about a project.

241
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,635
- Why?
- I didn't need to learn how to relax,

242
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,387
I needed to figure out
how to do the work.

243
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,388
So what do I do when...

244
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,265
Well, ask him...

245
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,648
Ask him what he needs and then
put him in the driver's seat

246
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,191
and he'll show you how to help him.

247
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,770
You make things so simple.

248
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,771
Always have.

249
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,404
- Curtis?
- No wonder Kord doesn't like

250
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,659
to share their secrets.

251
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,787
They invent
a lot of really nasty stuff.

252
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,620
Including this new military-grade
nerve gas, ZX.

253
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,625
What's that have to do
with our mystery killer woman?

254
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,423
<i>She downloaded the transport schedule
for said nerve gas.</i>

255
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,341
Do you find that alarming
or is it just me?

256
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,635
No, I definitely find that alarming.

257
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,882
- When is it moving?
<i>- One hour.</i>

258
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,508
Okay. I'm on my way.
Alert the Green Arrow.

259
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,090
I mean, Diggle,
I mean, John, I mean...

260
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,891
It's just good OPSEC
to use code names in the field.

261
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,343
I agree.

262
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,427
Go.

263
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,907
If you're not gonna say anything,
at least turn on the damn radio.

264
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,906
With your presets,
I prefer the silence.

265
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,986
Just turn it on.

266
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,461

That's what he's for.

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,362
- Why are we slowing down?

275
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,948

Any bogies on thermal?

281
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,597
Perfect. Ignition blocker.

282
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,898
Surprise, bitch.

283
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,285
Careful. Bullets

Or both?

287
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,331
They're getting away, hoss.
Make a decision.

288
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:44,915
Screw this.

289
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,809
Couldn't get to it.

290
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,773
Couldn't stop her.

291
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,396
Wasn't your fault.

292
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,662
What the hell happened out there?

293
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,169
Ask him. Dude just froze.

294
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,673
- Casualties?
- No. Everyone got out.

295
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,923
A dozen people were sent
to the hospital for smoke inhalation,

296
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,804
and two are in critical condition.

297
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,347
<i>What the hell, hoss?</i>

298
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,346
There were two targets and two of us,

299
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,018
what was so freaking complicated?

300
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,513
I don't know.

301
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,481
This never happened to me
in the field before.

302
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,393
Not in the army
and not with this team.

303
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,104
<i>Fog of war.</i>

304
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,733
Things don't always
go perfect out there,

305
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,362
so we close ranks and we move on.

306
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,901
Thanks.

307
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,697
It won't happen again.

308

<i>Okay.</i>

309
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,961
Good, 'cause it looks like you guys
get another shot at these guys.

310
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,914

311
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,378
<i>Onyx Adams.</i>

312
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,678
<i>Leader of a CIA black ops squad
working undercover in Syria.</i>

313
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,095
They disappeared in 2015 with

314
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,469
100 million dollars
in Syrian government gold.

315
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,970
And what have they been doing since?

316
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,052
My guess is preparing
for the ZX gas heist.

317
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,808
And finding the tech
they need to do it.

318
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,140
Why weren't they blinded
by the flashbangs like we were?

319
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,816
Also, if these guys got away
with 100 million in gold,

320
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,940
why would they risk it
by trying to steal nerve gas?

321
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,192
See if you can pick up any chatter
on the dark web,

322
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,615
encrypted message boards, whatever,
I'll check with Lyla.

323
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,863
See if any intel has changed.

324
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,992
Also, I'm sorry about tonight.

325
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,874
That wasn't me.

326
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,952
Hey, when I said move on...

327
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,877
I meant you, too.

328
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,677
<i>Fortunately, the two victims
in critical condition</i>

329
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,429
<i>are expected to recover.</i>

330
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,602
<i>Multiple witnesses
spotted Green Arrow</i>

331
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,350
<i>and his team
of vigilantes at the scene.</i>

332
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,898
Becky, can you get the
fire chief's latest report, please?

333
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,978
And can...

334
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,573
Would you mind putting in an order
for some coffee?

335
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,655
One of the big boxes
of coffee, please.

336
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,735
Thank you.

337
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,292
So I guess being the Green Arrow

338
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,790
involves something
of a learning curve.

339
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,293
We don't know the circumstances
surrounding last night.

340
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,624
Yeah, but we know
how it's gonna play out.

341
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,299
What do you mean?

342
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,460
Wow. Speak of the devil.

343
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,671
Got to admire her sense of timing.

344
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,426
- Who?
- Pollard.

345
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,719
She's seizing the moment.

346
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,301
She's using last night's disaster
as a pretext to introduce her

347
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,853
anti-vigilante legislation
to the council.

348
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,475
- Does she have the votes?
- I don't know.

349
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,102
Can you make sure she doesn't?

350
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,901
Hey.

351
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,988
Can we talk for a second?

352
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,669
I just wanted to say thank you
for having my back with the team.

353
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,667
Now truth be told, I...

354
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,999
I was a bit surprised
considering you...

355
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,459
Don't be surprised.

356
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,673
And don't think I said
what I said for you.

357
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,134
I said it because this team
needs a leader.

358
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,433
Without a chain of command,
we're easy pickings out there.

359
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,636
Okay.

360
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,221
I guess this is why you decided

361
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,558
not to tell anyone
about my injury, right?

362
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,142
It is.

363
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,604
But, honestly, as worried as I am
about your hand,

364
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,280
after last night, I'm a little more
worried about your head.

365
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,565
I know.

366
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,740
Hey, Dinah.

367
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,151
I know.

368
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,613
Look...

369
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,541
Every time I've had to give orders
in the army,

370
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,243
on this team,

371
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,669
there is always someone there
backing my plays.

372
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,594
I'm not used to making
the hard calls alone.

373
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,932
No one is more disappointed in me
than me.

374
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,717
Well, next time, get it right.

375
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,637
Our lives depend on it.

376
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,685
<i>She shoots, she scores.</i>

377
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,475
What do we have?

378
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,653
Okay, these are our new friends
back in 2015.

379
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,947
But last night,
you said there were five.

380
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,240
You think when their leader
went rogue,

381
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,362
not everyone went with her.

382
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,568
Well, Wild Dog for the win.

383
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,823
Three of the original members

384
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,745
defected back to the CIA,
for a little while, at least.

385
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,947
What do you mean,
"for a little while"?

386
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,657
'Cause this guy and this guy
were both killed

387
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,333
in separate poison gas attacks
last year.

388
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,206
One in Mosul, one in Tripoli.

389
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,376
The video footage is... Is...
It's really gruesome.

390
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,128
Well, poison gas
can't be a coincidence.

391
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,966
No. I mean, ISIS is linked
to both of them,

392
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,090
but I'm sure this is how
Onyx likes to solves her problems.

393
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,888
So she staged two terrorist attacks
just to settle a grudge?

394
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:44,964
<i>No, notjust a grudge.</i>

395
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,971
These are the only two
that can pin her to the stolen gold.

396
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,051
- Bingo.
- Right.

397
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,135
So she's wiping out defectors.

398
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,563
Got one left, Rob Reynolds,
whereabouts unknown.

399
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,107
Yeah, but you got to figure Star City
or somewhere close by.

400
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,274
Well, I'm guessing we should worry

401
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,818
what this gas could
do to a populated area.

402
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,190
Oh, yeah.

403
00:19:58,948 --> 00:19:59,938
Look.

404
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,625
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

405
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,331
How's it going?

406
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,084
Fine.

407
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,087
Still worried about the test?

408
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,504
Yeah.

409
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,265
Anything that I can do to help?

410
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,811
Do you know quadratic equations?

411
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,687
Wow! Um...

412
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,021
Those sound... Vaguely familiar.

413
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,274
Then again, I wasn't the most
enthusiastic math student, so...

414
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,774
I really shouldn't be talking to
anyone who can't help me right now.

415
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,692
Okay.

416
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,534
Got a minute, hoss?

417
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:55,994
Sure.

418
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,756
This about Pollard's bill?

419
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,759
No, uh, sorry.

420
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,052
I've been out of the office.

421
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,135
No, this is about John.

422
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,218
What about him?

423
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,012
It's not working out.

424
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,313
You talking about last night?

425
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,515
I'm talking about something...

426
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,142
I'm talking about something

427
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,192
a hell of a lot worse
than what happened last night.

428
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,614
That poison gas could kill thousands.

429
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,689
John can handle it.

430
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,650
That's why I'm here, hoss.

431
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,276
He can't.

432
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,785
He's in over his head.

433
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,613
We're lucky nobody died last night.

434
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,243
But luck runs out.

435
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,077
We need you to come back.

436
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,674
I'm still working
on a 20 with Reynolds.

437
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,754
It's gonna take a while,

438
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,885
these black op guys
are really hard to find.

439
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,925
Hey.

440
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,259
Hey.

441
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,394
Wow... Just surprised
to see you here.

442
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,598
And also surprised
that you remember the access code.

443
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,852
It's been like a week.

444
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,354
Yeah, it was a joke.

445
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,568
- Okay.
- I'm guessing you're here for...

446
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,655
Well, yeah. And the guy that you're
searching for, this Reynolds.

447
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,030
- Yeah.
- Couldn't Curtis handle it?

448
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,827
Yeah, I'm sure he can.
Why? What do you need?

449
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,405
Well, I asked William what he needs,

450
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,912
and he needs a tutor.

451
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,584
Well, lucky for you and for him,

452
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,960
you're looking at Nevada's
three-time State Mathletics Champion.

453
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,627
Only three times?

454
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,798
Yeah, they wouldn't
let freshmen enter.

455
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,921
It was an ordeal.

456
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,048
I got over it but still kinda hurts.

457
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,754
This can't interfere
with an operation.

458
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,839
No, we're in a holding pattern.

459
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,674
I'm sure Curtis can come
and cover me.

460
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,758
I might have to leave abruptly,

461
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,515
but other than that, yeah, no,
it's not a problem.

462
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,345
Well, I'll probably see you
back there. I'm gonna...

463
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,647
Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah.

464
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,392
Yeah, I'll call Curtis.
He'll be here soon.

465
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,068
Okay. Okay, bye, bye.

466
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,825
This is weird.

467
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,320
<i>Being back down here?</i>

468
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,703
How many times have you
come down here to find me brooding?

469
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,499
I'm not brooding, Oliver,
I'm thinking.

470
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,659
Yeah.

471
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,248
Okay, maybe I'm brooding
a little bit.

472
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,925
Well, if you haven't
figured it out already,

473
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:11,756
that expression is as much a part
of the uniform as the green hood.

474
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,681
Every time you were
down here brooding,

475
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,180
it was because you made
some kind of mistake.

476
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,479
I think you made
another one, man.

477
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,556
No.

478
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,058
Not even close.

479
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,935
Who came to you? Rene?

480
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,279
I needed to come
and ask Felicity a favor.

481
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,148
And then, of course, I saw that very

482
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,112
familiar expression.

483
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,198
Makes me wonder
if maybe I asked too much of you.

484
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,278
What do you mean?

485
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,739
I gave up being
the Green Arrow for William.

486
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:39,866
But...

487
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,128
You have JJ, you have Lyla,
it doesn't exactly seem fair...

488
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,046
That's not the issue at all, Oliver.

489
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,001
I made my peace with
this whole life a long time ago.

490
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,301
So what's the problem?

491
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,845
I don't know how you did it.

492
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,137
You never hesitated to make the call.

493
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,386
You were always sure, I'm not.

494
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,845
I was never sure.

495
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,765
Not one time.

496
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,561
I'm very flattered that it looked
that way on the outside,

497
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,442
but on the inside, it was...

498
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,400
It was instinct, it was instinct
and it was fear.

499
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,530
Yeah, but you worked past it.

500
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,282
Well, you'll work past it too.

501
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,830
Now, I'm not gonna sit here
and say that you won't

502
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,999
make mistakes, that you won't

503
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,002
lose people along the way,
you know most...

504
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,048
Most will be strangers but some...

505
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,005
Well, some won't be.

506
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,795
Because, John,

507
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,013
you're one of the main reasons

508
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,216
that the Green Arrow even exists.

509
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,139
What are you talking about?

510
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,311
The Restons.

511
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,814
- The bank robbers?
- The bank robbers, yeah.

512
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,650
You were the first person
who convinced me to look

513
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,942
past just the names
on my father's list.

514
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,775
You helped me discover that the hood,
that persona,

515
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,485
he wasn't a hero,
you helped me find one.

516
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,162
All of this, the Green Arrow,
the idea of it,

517
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,955
it exists because you had
faith in me.

518
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,835
Now you got to have
the same kind of faith in yourself.

519
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,462
'Cause if you do,

520
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,507
you can be a better leader,

521
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,597
you can be a better hero

522
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:23,974
than I ever was.

523
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,239
- Sit Rep.
- Good to go.

524
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,778
Any doubts?

525
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:41,863
You ask that each time.

526
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,580
Because we are going after
our brothers-in-arms.

527
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,460
Comrades.

528
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,454
I need your resolve.

529
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,538
You got it.

530
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,373
And tonight, Reynolds gets his.

531
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,458
Roger that.

532
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,625
What about the Green Arrow?

533
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,794
What about him?

534
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,547
You've seen him in the field.

535
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,222
Being highly trained operators,
would you consider him a threat?

536
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,019
- Hell, no.
- There's your answer.

537
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,387
Move out.

538
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,479
Okay, and after you divide by X?

539
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,444
Solve for X?

540
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,816
Yes, but first...

541
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,817
Is it factor the binomials?

542
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,402
Yeah, right. Cool.

543
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,741
But why can't I just solve for X?

544
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,619
Well, you will, I mean, eventually,
probably in high school, but,

545
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,001
first you have to master
the binomials.

546
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,328
Well, I'm gonna bomb this.

547
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,422
You know, it sucks
because you're new and

548
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,419
probably a little behind. But...

549
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,010
The fact that you're frustrated means
you can see how useful

550
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,220
math could be,
which means, unfortunately,

551
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,098
you're really good at it.

552
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,896
Oliver said school doesn't matter
in the real world.

553
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,019
Hmm. Well, Oliver didn't grow up
in the real world.

554
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,443
School changed my life.

555
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,853
I used to love school.

556
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:55,937
Yeah.

557
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,068
You will again. Promise.

558
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,281
How is it going in here?

559
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,326
- Good.
- Yeah, I'd say we're

560
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,123
- making progress.
- Good.

561
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,622
Could you tutor me some more
before the test?

562
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,539
Yeah, I mean, if it's cool
with your dad, it's cool with me.

563
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,715
If it's cool with you,
it's totally cool with me.

564
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,547
Special delivery.

565
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,598
Okay,
that's not grilled cheese.

566
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,143
No, it's not grilled cheese,
those are Monte Cristos.

567
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,470
What's a Monte Cristo?

568
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,645
What? You've never had...

569
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,271
This is the best night-time snack
you can ever have.

570
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,727
- And you used waffles.
- Well...

571
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,404
That is how we do it
in the not-real world.

572
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,776
Ha.

573
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,367
Curtis got a location
on Reynolds.

574
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,954
We got to... Well, I got to go.

575
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,496
This is... Without you. It's weird.

576
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,619
Best of luck out there.

577
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,041
Oh, I'll be in the bunker if it is.

578
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,369
- William, you're awesome.
- Thank you.

579
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,452
See you soon.

580
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,748
She is pretty cool.

581
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,338
Yeah, she is.

582
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,463
Traffic cams picked up
Reynolds heading north on Hillcrest,

583
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,470
the only things out there
are souvenirs and Haselby Grand.

584
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,394
Hotels are a great place for
an ex-spook to stash a gold bag.

585
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,141
Try to slip out
with the tourist crowd.

586
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,972
Huh. Makes you wonder if
his old crew tipped him off

587
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,807
or if he's just the luckiest target
in the world.

588
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,110
<i>Either way, there are
hundreds of people in that hotel,</i>

589
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,153
- so if they disperse the gas...
- They won't.

590
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:20,855
Let's move out.

591
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,150
Did he forget to say "Suit up"?

592
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,611
Or was "Let's move"
like, his version of "Suit up"?

593
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,197
Because, personally, I like "Let's
suit up" 'cause then you know...

594
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,123
- Go suit up, Curtis.
- Yeah, I'll go suit up.

595
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,078
Hey, hey.

596
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,874
Can you handle this?

597
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,127
I asked Oliver to come back.

598
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,760
Well, the fact that he didn't
should tell you something, right?

599
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,886
Maybe. Look, all I know for sure,

600
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,385
if John doesn't
straighten himself out,

601
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,061
it's gonna be another rough night.

602
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,492
- I got eyes on the tango.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

603
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,785
Package is deployed.

604
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,841
<i>What do we know, Overwatch?</i>

605
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:22,963
Lots.

606
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,716
Thermal reads a potential
166 casualties inside

607
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,672
and Onyx's team cut the CCTV.

608
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,927
So we're going in blind.

609
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,259
Literally, if we get hit with
those flashbangs of hers again.

610
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,969
Your dorky ass glasses better work.

611
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,487
Hello?

612
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,992
What's going on? The door's locked.

613
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,713
I have visuals, thanks to
Mr. Terrific's T-Spheres. Go now.

614
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,894
We need locations on Reynolds
and the gas.

615
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,097
I have him. Upper lobby.

616
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,601
But I got no way
of detecting the gas.

617
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,979
Canary, Terrific,
see if you can locate the gas.

618
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,652
Dog, you're with me on evac
after we clear Reynolds.

619
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,071
I really hope
he's not making decisions

620
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,489
based on animal code names.

621
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,192
Incoming!

622
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,330
All right, hoss,
let's check these out.

623
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,040
<i>Guys, you got two hostiles
in the lobby.</i>

624
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,759
Guess your old tricks don't work.

625
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,477
I don't need tricks.

626
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,429
Just collateral.

627
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,857
No.

628
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,282
<i>Onyx just released
the gas. What should we do?</i>

629
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,958
<i>Gas is spreading, do you copy?</i>

630
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,500
<i>Arrow? Arrow, do you copy?</i>

631
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,376
Handle the gas.

632
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,469
We've got Reynolds, move.

633
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,841
<i>Gas is coming from the trashcan.</i>

634
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,844
Everybody, get behind me now.

635
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,550
Get behind me now.

636
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,527
I'm going after Reynolds.

637
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,109
Night-night.

638
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,822
Overwatch, we need a way
to neutralize the nerve gas.

639
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,622
You could burn it,
but I don't suggest it

640
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,244
since you're still
inside the building.

641
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,418
We won't be for long. I hope.

642
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,796
The breaches are too small
to evacuate all these people.

643
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,214
Which is why we're gonna
make them bigger.

644
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,265
Going somewhere?

645
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,096
I wasn't gonna tell anyone
about the gold.

646
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,648
You know, it turns out
money can buy happiness.

647
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,976
Just can't buy peace of mind.

648
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,352
You all right?

649
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,697
Who the hell are you?

650
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,449
I'm the Green Arrow.

651
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,078
I got one of Onyx's flashbangs,
should be enough to ignite the gas.

652
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,662
Okay, everyone,
when I count to three,

653
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,999
that wall is going bye-bye,
so I need you all to haul ass.

654
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,209
There is nerve gas
followed by a huge explosion.

655
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,544
I don't think they
need the motivation.

656
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,674
Good point.

657
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,800
One...

658
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,880
Two...

659
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,215
Three.

660
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,391
<i>Gas dispersed.</i>

661
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,310
<i>All civilians accounted for.</i>

662
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,394
Good work.

663
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,729
The other four are down.

664
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,064
Onyx is in the limo.

665
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,194
What about this guy?

666
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,697
He helped steal millions in foreign
gold and turned a blind eye

667
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,495
when his comrades were being
killed off of fake terrorist attacks.

668
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,324
It was good work back there.

669
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,124
Following your lead, hoss.

670
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,499
Can we do this after every win?

671
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,710
New tradition for a new era,
I like that.

672
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,711
To go with our new
Team Arrow victory dance.

673
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,259
Didn't know we had an old one.

674
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,590
We don't, never will.

675
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,934
Things won't be changing around here
that much.

676
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,428
Look...

677
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,352
There is something you should know.

678
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,432
You went to Oliver.

679
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,235
- You told him.
- She didn't have to.

680
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,563
I know you, Rene.

681
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,027
I know all of you.

682
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,368
It's a leader's job to.

683
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,406
Oh, yes.

684
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,827
So, Curtis and I have been
working on a little something

685
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,253
<i>in our spare time,
very limited spare time, may I add.</i>

686
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,380
We call it...

687
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,959
The Green Monster.

688
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,464
Or something cooler than that,

689
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,761
pretty much whatever
you want to call it.

690
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,632
The important part is that it shoots
arrows instead of crossbow bolts.

691
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,183
260 pound draw weight,

692
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,761
the arrows exit the gate at 400FPS,
that's feet per second.

693
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,063
<i>Integrated recoil
energy dissipation system.</i>

694
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,017
Adjustable mount, scope,
quick detach quivers,

695
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,944
pistol grip, finger guard,
non-slip rubber insert.

696
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,441
Do you two want a moment alone?

697
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,397
You want to take it for a spin?

698
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:31,744
Damn, hoss.

699
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,955
Did you guys put stabilizers
on that crossbow?

700
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,541
Nope. That aim there
is pure John Diggle.

701
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,876
Not a bad idea, though,
for the next upgrade.

702
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,388
Nice going.

703
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,094
Steady.

704
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,518
See? Told you. Tremor's gone.

705
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,474
Well, I'm convinced.

706
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,227
You were wrong
about one thing, though.

707
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,311
What's that?

708
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,279
You can make the hard calls
on your own just fine.

709
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,202
Thank you.

710
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,996
Hey.

711
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,755
So your friends did good last night.

712
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,836
I had a feeling
John would get it together.

713
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,133
How did you manage?

714
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,590
Too many councilmen owe Pollard
too many favors.

715
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,925
It's gonna pass, Oliver.

716
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,008
We'll veto it.

717
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,561
You got enough PR problems as it is,
don't you think?

718
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,604
Besides, they've got enough votes
for an override.

719
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,603
There has to be something
that we can do.

720
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,104
Matter of fact...

721
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,945
Let the record show there are no nays
on the anti-vigilante measure.

722
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,363
<i>Those in favor.</i>

723
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,439
Point of order.

724
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,572
Does it address
the matter at hand, Mr. Mayor?

725
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,620
It does, Madam Parliamentarian.

726
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,162
Thank you.

727
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,242
And good morning.

728
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,415
As you know, I have been accused
of a great many things recently.

729
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,800
Including but not limited
to supporting vigilantes

730
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,094
at the expense
of our men and women in uniform.

731
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,889
This was never my intention.

732
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,345
<i>In the wake of the attacks
on the SCPD,</i>

733
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,678
putting this police force
back on its feet

734
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,138
is my number one priority as mayor.

735
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:19,435
We need the women and men of the SCPD
on our streets protecting us,

736
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,690
but they can't do that

737
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,106
if they are busy hunting vigilantes.

738
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,158
<i>That is why I oppose this bill,</i>

739
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,659
and that is why I am invoking
chapter 9 of the City Charter.

740
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,212
And you are aware that will convert
Councilwoman Pollard's bill

741
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,085
to a citywide referendum.

742
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,415
I certainly am.

743
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,171
<i>Because last night,</i>

744
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:47,471
a group of vigilantes
saved hundreds of lives.

745
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,637
So if we are going to decide

746
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,936
on diverting police resources
towards stopping them,

747
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,273
we are not gonna do that until
the people of Star City have spoken.

748
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,568
What the hell was that?

749
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,611
Stay of execution.

750
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,080
<i>The mayor's procedural maneuver</i>

751
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,783
<i>took both the Council
and the public by surprise.</i>

752
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,413
<i>How the public will decide</i>

753
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,292
<i>on the issue of vigilantism
is anyone's guess.</i>

754
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,840
<i>According to multiple reports,
the City Council was set to pass</i>

755
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,840
<i>strict measures against
the Green Arrow and his team.</i>

756
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,763
<i>This anti-vigilante legislation
was introduced...</i>

757
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,091
Who are you protecting?

758
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,567
Oliver.

759
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,990
- With a gift.
- You busy?

760
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,450
No, um...

761
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,991
No, I... Come in.

762
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,960
I was just working
on a name for the startup

763
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,880
which would be a lot easier
if Curtis and I actually knew

764
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,253
what we were trying to start up.

765
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,385
You know,
"That's tomorrow's problem."

766
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,593
Is it my birthday?

767
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,765
William got an A on his test.

768
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,350
Oh, he did? Oh, that's awesome.

769
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,348
I mean, I knew he would,
he is super smart,

770
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,555
his understanding of math
is at prodigy level, much...

771
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,358
Like me at his age.

772
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:23,730
Can you believe he's your son?

773
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,400
I didn't mean it...
That's not what I meant. I mean...

774
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,025
Math isn't everything.

775
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,733
I mean, you have, you have so many
redeeming qualities, you know,

776
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,910
you have amazing abs and...

777
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,658
I'm just gonna open this.

778
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,738
- Please.
- If it's okay.

779
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,042
Hmm.

780
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,920
It's a key to my apartment.

781
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,460
Okay.

782
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,299
Um...

783
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,217
Won't that be confusing for William?

784
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,674
I mean, it sure as hell
is confusing for me.

785
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,468
I know that when I took William in,

786
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,521
we agreed that we would
keep our distance because

787
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,016
he was gonna have a lot to process.

788
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,646
- He's still got a lot to process.
- Yes, he does.

789
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,026
Every day there's a new challenge.

790
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,908
I sense a "but" coming,
there is a "but" coming, right?

791
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,532
But I saw you with him.

792
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,911
And I became 100% sure that...

793
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,667
If you want...

794
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,827
His life

795
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,788
will be better

796
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,210
with you in it.
