1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,296
<i>Last season on "Arrow"...</i>

2
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:04,823
<i>Star City's
seen better days.</i>

3
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:06,299
<i>They built a wall.</i>

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,886
<i>Star City is
a wall-free zone once again.</i>

5
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,413
Restoring the Glades
won't be easy.

6
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,949
<i>The four of you are
the heroes that this city needs.</i>

7
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,892
We're stepping back.
We're leaving Star City.

8
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,185
What now?

9
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:18,937
A crisis
is imminent.

10
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,438
What does
the multiverse require?

11
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,148
We seek to prevent
the inevitable.

12
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,650
What are you not telling me?

13
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,376
<i>I've seen your
future, Oliver,</i>

14
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>inexorable
and unavoidable.</i>

15
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,113
<i>I have watched you die.</i>

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,514
<i>Among the many
misconceptions humanity holds dear</i>

17
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:57,725
<i>is the fallacy that all beings
are created equal.</i>

18
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,482
<i>In truth, there are
those who are greater.</i>

19
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,112
<i>They are called heroes.</i>

20
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:15,201
<i>But even among heroes,
there are different echelons.</i>

21
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:20,873
<i>The highest belong to those
known as the paragons.</i>

22
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:25,503
<i>And they are the only hope
of all creation.</i>

23
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:42,937
Oliver?

24
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,110
Hi, Mom.

25
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,529
Ohh. Ohh.

26
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,156
I missed you so much.

27
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:57,035
Oh, my beautiful boy.
My beautiful boy.

28
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,599
Your room is exactly
as you left it.

29
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,185
I never had the heart
to change anything.

30
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:25,902
I can't tell you how great
it feels to be home.

31
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,191
Oliver, it's really you.

32
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:31,903
Hi, Malcolm.

33
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,071
Welcome home.

34
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:39,160
Ok, what... where's...
where's Walter?

35
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,579
He sold his shares of
the company

36
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,164
when the Gambit
went down.

37
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:48,419
Okay. Okay.

38
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:53,675
What'd I tell you?

39
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,843
Yachts suck.

40
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,888
I knew it. I knew you were
too stubborn to be dead.

41
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:06,479
Tommy.

42
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,584
Come on, man.
Why are you looking at me like

43
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,610
I'm the one who's
been gone a decade?

44
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,320
I just missed you.

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,991
Where's Thea?

46
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,705
Sweetheart, um, why
don't you settle in?

47
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,623
I mean, you
must be exhausted.

48
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,959
Yeah, but I'd like
to see Thea.

49
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:33,589
Oliver, when you and your
father disappeared...

50
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,176
it wasn't easy on her.

51
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,886
She took things
really hard.

52
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:42,306
And there is this new
drug called vertigo.

53
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,016
- I swear to you...
- Tommy.

54
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,184
I tried my best
to look...

55
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,431
Tommy,
it wasn't your fault.

56
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,568
What wasn't his fault?

57
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,572
Thea, on
her 18th birthday...

58
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,452
she overdosed.

59
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,836
Raisa's famous
chicken marsala?

60
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,597
I used to make this
for William all the time.

61
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,591
Who's William?

62
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:17,884
Oh, I know.

63
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,386
He was, like, your Wilson
on the island, right?

64
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,637
Something like that.

65
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:25,349
How did you manage
to survive by yourself all that time?

66
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,477
It's a long story.

67
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,772
So, uh,
things you missed

68
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,482
while you were gone.

69
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,735
I got married
and divorced twice.

70
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:40,490
Ah, let's see. What other
gossip did you miss?

71
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,575
Our parents getting married.

72
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,581
- It's, um...
- Complicated.

73
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,668
Oliver, I know
this must all be a lot.

74
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,507
Well, mom, my apologies,
but I actually am a little tired,

75
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,592
and I think I'm gonna head
up to my bedroom.

76
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,303
Thank you for dinner.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,001
Hey.

78
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,795
Your bed has been made.

79
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,965
And there are fresh
towels in the bathroom.

80
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,424
Thank you.

81
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,304
I know the changes
must be overwhelming,

82
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,390
and you must feel
like you're

83
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,058
on a different planet
or something.

84
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,393
You could say that.

85
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,313
It couldn't have been easy
all those years on that island.

86
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,691
Sounds like it wasn't
that easy here.

87
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,112
Now, you're not the same
man as when you left.

88
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,614
And don't take this
the wrong way,

89
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,367
but I get the sense
that it's...

90
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,661
it's for the better.

91
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,291
I'm not so sure.

92
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,627
Mom, when we were
growing up,

93
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:24,051
if you had to leave me
and Thea to protect us...

94
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,265
would you have done it?

95
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,729
Oliver, whether
right or wrong,

96
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,107
everything I've ever done
was to protect my children.

97
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,193
It's all
a parent can do.

98
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,991
And someday, hmm,
when you have children,

99
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,369
you'll understand.

100
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,997
Mom, I'm so sorry.

101
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,541
Ohh. Ohh.

102
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,084
Everything's okay.

103
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,088
You're home.
You're safe.

104
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,967
Close your eyes,
sweetheart.

105
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,719
Get some rest, okay?

106
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,304
All right.

107
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,404
You have failed this city.

108
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,282
Hyah!

109
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,356
Stand down.

110
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,484
Oliver,

111
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,211
what the hell
are you doing on my Earth?

112
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,138
Showoff.

113
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:15,765
Jealous?

114
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,225
Nostalgic.

115
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,770
It seems Adrian and I
have the same design sense.

116
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,066
If by that you mean
Felicity, yeah.

117
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,443
But this is my bunker.

118
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,153
Chase?

119
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,363
He's one of the good
guys, literally.

120
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,325
And you're helping him
in Star City.

121
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,119
Starling City.
And he's helping me.

122
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,580
We make a pretty
good team, actually.

123
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,541
Not that kind
of a team.

124
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,377
So how much small talk
do I have to endure

125
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,547
before you tell me what
it is exactly you're doing on my Earth?

126
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,841
Yeah, it's
a long story.

127
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,736
Why don't you start
by telling me

128
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,136
what you were doing
on Lian Yu?

129
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,573
You know, if you wanted
to pretend to be back from the dead,

130
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,057
you could've just showed
up in town.

131
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,350
I wasn't given
a choice.

132
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,978
I was sent to your Earth,
and I arrived on Lian Yu.

133
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,689
Sent? Sent by who?

134
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,856
You get him to tell you
the truth yet, pretty bird?

135
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,693
And nothing but.

136
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,029
Seems Mr. Queen survived
the Gambit

137
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,241
and has spent the last
12 years on an island called Lian Yu.

138
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,119
That means
"purgatory" if I'm not mistaken.

139
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,204
It still doesn't explain
what you're doing

140
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,622
running around in my hood.

141
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,374
I needed an identity
to work under,

142
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,042
and yours seemed
convenient.

143
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,753
Sorry.

144
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,403
What were you doing
at Queen-Merlyn?

145
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,132
Not killing those
scientists,

146
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,550
if that's what
you are implying.

147
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,552
Well, I'm using Laurel's
equipment to compare

148
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,971
the metallurgy of your
arrows to the ones that we found

149
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,973
in those men and women,
so we'll see.

150
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,809
Speak of the devil.

151
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:44,687
Literally.

152
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,148
The Dark Archer?
Name's a bit on the nose,

153
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,399
but it's descriptive.

154
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,317
Dark costume,
jade pendant.

155
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,485
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

156
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,630
- Yeah, we thought so, too.
- Ruled him out months ago.

157
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,447
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

158
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,658
And he killed those
scientists for a reason.

159
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,119
Where are you
going?

160
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:02,830
I'm gonna have
a conversation with my stepdad.

161
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,095
It never ceases
to impress...

162
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,473
humanity's capacity
for invention.

163
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,226
Hmm. Infinite number
of worlds,

164
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,897
and not a single one
where man fails to emerge from caves

165
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:30,149
and hold dominion
over the Earth.

166
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,317
What are you doing here?

167
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,068
Reminding you what you
are doing here,

168
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,612
which does not
include interfering

169
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,113
in the events of this Earth.

170
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,424
I have no intention
of interfering.

171
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,533
Are you not here
to confront Malcolm Merlyn

172
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,453
with your suspicion that
he is the Dark Archer?

173
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,039
Well, I went to
Applied Sciences last night

174
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,665
to retrieve the
dwarf star particles

175
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,292
just like you
asked me to.

176
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,711
You make it sound
like a trifle.

177
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,006
Those specific particles
can only be found

178
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,799
on this Earth out of
a multitude.

179
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,511
My point is that when I arrived,
Malcolm had already stolen them.

180
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,972
You know what
might help?

181
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,141
If I actually knew why
I was after them.

182
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,019
That I have tasked you
should be reason enough.

183
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,898
Or have you come to doubt
your commitment to this mission?

184
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,108
No, I have not.

185
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,906
At Harris Consolidated, we see
the wall coming down as an opportunity.

186
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,283
For the criminals of Star City
to rob the Glades blind?

187
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,534
To reunite the city.

188
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,554
I don't think people
in the Glades got that memo

189
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,580
'cause last I checked,
crime's up 300%

190
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,998
since the wall
went down.

191
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,043
There's an old saying...
there are 3 kinds of liars:

192
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,880
liars, damn liars,
and statisticians.

193
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,133
You're focusing on the Glades
to the exclusion of Star City

194
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,053
while net, there's been
a citywide reduction in crime.

195
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,391
And we have the vigilantes who
brought down the wall in the first place

196
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,558
to thank for that.

197
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,686
Hear that, guys?
We're famous.

198
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,814
Really? 'Cause it sounds like
we got a long way to go.

199
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,875
Which is why we're
here, to make sure

200
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,776
nothing happens
to Mr. Vasquez.

201
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,280
Whoa. And where do
you think you're going?

202
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,908
Movement outside.
Gonna check it out.

203
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,118
<i>Negative.</i>

204
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,369
Don't break perimeter.

205
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,912
Relax. It'll take a sec.

206
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,372
Just like Pennytown.

207
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,082
What was that, Mr. Harris?

208
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,877
Uh... oh. I... I was just saying
that the unification money

209
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,714
put into Pennytown prevented
a potential disaster

210
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,924
<i>because we listened
to each other.</i>

211
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,678
Well, she is either
ignoring you, William...

212
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,096
For the second time
this month.

213
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,503
or the comm systems
are failing.

214
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,890
For the fifth time
this month.

215
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,457
<i>It's a new era.</i>

216
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,561
Growing pains are to be
expected. Heh!

217
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,151
<i>Mia, do you copy?</i>

218
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,278
Excuse me, miss.

219
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,239
Mr. Vasquez doesn't want
any guests wandering the property.

220
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,908
This neighborhood just...
just isn't safe anymore.

221
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,578
Sorry. I just, uh,
wanted a look around.

222
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:48,746
<i>Mia...</i>

223
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,750
Allow me to escort
you back in.

224
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,179
We recently completed
a total IT upgrade.

225
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:08,265
500 miles worth of
high-capacity fiber optics

226
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,184
married to an underground
server farm.

227
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,687
Is something like that
for Applied Sciences?

228
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,315
We had a small incident
there last night.

229
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,900
Very unfortunate.

230
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,770
The police
are investigating.

231
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,945
Oh, that's too bad.
I hope no one was hurt.

232
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,591
So do you think it had
anything to do with the, um,

233
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,575
the Dwarf... Dwarf
Star Project?

234
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:27,868
How do you know about that?

235
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,120
Oh, the internet. Heh!

236
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,206
I didn't know you had
wi-fi on Lian Yu.

237
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:35,417
No, no, no. I wish.
I stayed up late at the house last night,

238
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,044
doing my research,
catching up.

239
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,481
Well, the press coverage
hasn't been particularly kind.

240
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,382
Everyone wants to make
the Dwarf Star Project

241
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,300
out to be
something sinister,

242
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,595
but it's just an
alternative energy source project,

243
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,389
completely benign.

244
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,100
I suppose everything's
a matter of interpretation.

245
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,413
Now, do you think that
someone could show me

246
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,997
to the most important
room on this tour?

247
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,524
And, uh, what would
that be?

248
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,485
The bathroom.

249
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,579
It's supposed to be red.

250
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:14,665
Excuse me.

251
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,419
Nothing. Sorry. I'm
looking for Felicity Smoak.

252
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,630
Ha ha! Like Felicity Smoak
would slum it in IT

253
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,173
instead of running
Smoak tech.

254
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,467
Oh, good for her.
Sorry.

255
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,053
Who does run the IT
department?

256
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,160
There you are.

257
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:09,219
Malcolm Merlyn, you have
failed this city.

258
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,889
I... I... don't know what
you think I did, but I...

259
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,311
Aah!

260
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,637
- Oh, God.
- Get out of here!

261
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,768
Oh, no.

262
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,197
So that's your story.

263
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,498
An archer in black flew in
and attacked The Hood.

264
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,084
Hmm?

265
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,171
Well, who is he?
Why did he do that?

266
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,758
I don't know.
Find him, and you ask.

267
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,427
First there was an attack
on Applied Sciences.

268
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,514
Now there's a war between
two masks in your own office.

269
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,682
And your point, Sergeant?

270
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,601
My point is that I highly doubt
this is a coincidence.

271
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,228
Well,
obviously not.

272
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,690
Somebody is clearly targeting
my father's company.

273
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,025
Right. Except
from his statement,

274
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,777
your father claimed
The Hood

275
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,153
was targeting him.

276
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,240
It's funny. He doesn't
usually go after the good guys.

277
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,534
All right.
Interview's over.

278
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,369
Anything else you need,
Sergeant Drake,

279
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,205
you can either go through
me or Mr. Merlyn's attorney.

280
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:03,500
Perfect. I needed something
to look forward to.

281
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,715
She's got a point.

282
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,967
It's a lot of drama
for the past 24 hours.

283
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,636
Maybe we should reconsider
Oliver's welcome home party.

284
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,471
No, no, no, no.
It'll just look like

285
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,015
we're trying to
cover something up.

286
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,934
Yeah. And I missed tequila.

287
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,480
Oliver.

288
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,399
I want you to meet
John Diggle.

289
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,860
He'll be accompanying
you from now on.

290
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:34,448
Er... no. Sorry. No. I don't
need a babysitter, Mom.

291
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,533
No, this is something
that I need.

292
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:39,870
Yeah.

293
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,296
So what do I call you?

294
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,757
Diggle. Dig if you want.

295
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,058
Sorry, Oliver.
Fool me once.

296
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,040
- <i>How did you find me?
- It wasn't easy.</i>

297
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,250
It was like you disappeared
off the face of the Earth...

298
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,527
until Felicity figured out
that it was only our Earth.

299
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,939
Still, John, it's not like
you can just charter a jet.

300
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,117
Cisco let me borrow it.

301
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,304
And now if I'm done
answering your questions,

302
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,371
I have a few of my own.

303
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,289
- Can't talk about it.
- Can't or won't?

304
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,684
You know, Oliver,
it's interesting

305
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,268
that we're revisiting
when we first met.

306
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,671
You going at it all
alone is like deja vu.

307
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,231
I thought you and I
were past that.

308
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,842
This is new. It's bigger.

309
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,682
And I'm not going to ask you
to take the risk it involves.

310
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,648
Oliver, that's the thing
about being brothers.

311
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,812
You never, ever
have to ask.

312
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,899
Can you just believe me
when I tell you this is different?

313
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:55,070
Yeah. Felicity told me.
Some godlike being

314
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,217
talking about
the end of the universe?

315
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,496
What didn't she tell
me, Oliver?

316
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,665
A crisis is coming, John.

317
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,962
He's seen what happens.

318
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,466
He's watched me die.

319
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,889
Thank you for not making
a fuss about coming back in.

320
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,784
I wouldn't want you
and your friends

321
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:25,892
to miss out on the party.

322
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,678
Don't engage the Deathstrokes.

323
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,703
They're a distraction.

324
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,374
Guys! No one listens
to the tech guy.

325
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,551
Fine. I guess I'll do it.

326
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,430
William.

327
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,814
You okay?

328
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,150
Yeah. Mia, you okay?

329
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,902
They took Vasquez.

330
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,695
The Deathstroke gang.

331
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,113
Screw them.

332
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,740
Who's the one playing
security guard?

333
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,283
He knew who I was.

334
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,886
He knows
who we all are.

335
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,911
What? How?

336
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:28,872
He's my brother.

337
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,417

341
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,805
Well, hello. You will
be pleased to hear

342
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,474
that I made sure the bar
was stocked with pinot noir.

343
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,147
I'll be right back.

344
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,154
<i>♪ Balla per me
bimbo bianco ♪</i>

345
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,535
You know, the party's
back that way.

346
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,204
I don't have time
for this, John.

347
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,455
Oliver...

348
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,542
has it occurred to you that
whatever happens in this crisis

349
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,908
happens because you push
the people closest to you away?

350
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,671
So you're in a forward area.

351
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,966
Somebody throws a grenade
right into the middle of your platoon.

352
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,676
What do you do?

353
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,153
I jump on it.
I contain the blast.

354
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,387
That's what I'm doing.

355
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,599
I can't prevent whatever
it is that's going to happen to me,

356
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:33,645
but I will be damned if I'm going to put
other people at risk.

357
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,730
And I will be damned

358
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,483
if I just let you
go gently into that good night.

359
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:41,987
Okay.

360
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,239
All right.

361
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,413
You always fall
for this move.

362
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:02,841
Wow. That Lian Yu
must have been one hell of a place...

363
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,385
Oliver.

364
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,435
So were you ever
really gone?

365
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,482
Because it looks like
you've been running around

366
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,105
in a certain green hood.

367
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,195
Like you've been running
around in a black one?

368
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:24,362
Heh. Ah, Ollie, you never should've
gotten yourself involved in this.

369
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,426
Hope I didn't hurt you.

370
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,305
Leave us.

371
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,306
So I've been
thinking it over,

372
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,191
and you really were
on Lian Yu,

373
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,817
because if you had been here,

374
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,861
you would've been
protecting our sister.

375
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,741
So the question is,

376
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,827
why are you running around
in The Hood's hood?

377
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,913
- Doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does!

378
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,667
The Hood is running around
this city, thinking that

379
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,003
he's saving it,
and nothing can save it.

380
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:27,092
You don't understand
the cancer

381
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,220
that has taken over
this city.

382
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,642
Oh, my God. This is
the Undertaking.

383
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:42,107
You stole the dwarf star
particles because you want...

384
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,611
to destroy the Glades
and get vengeance for Thea.

385
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,780
How could you know that?

386
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,582
And what happened
to you on that island?

387
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,713
What happened to you
while I was on the island?

388
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:12,303
While you were gone,
this city has been rotting.

389
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,056
It can't be saved!

390
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,850
That's not true, Tommy.

391
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,270
I have seen
Starling City come back

392
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:21,980
from darker moments
than this.

393
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,192
It can be redeemed.
You can be redeemed.

394
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,820
You don't understand
what I've seen.

395
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,283
You don't know
how I found our sister.

396
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:39,414
Every time I close my eyes,
I see her body lying there, cold,

397
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,499
on a dirty floor.

398
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,253
So I swore that I would get
vengeance on the Glades

399
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,838
for what it did to Thea,

400
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:50,008
and I am not going to let
her down. Not again!

401
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,968
That's not gonna make
you feel better, Tommy.

402
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,304
I don't care about
feeling better.

403
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,308
I just want the Glades
to suffer.

404
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,769
You're a better man
than this.

405
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,480
That was a different me.

406
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,192
Good-bye, Oliver.

407
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:11,905
Tonight was a disaster.

408
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,073
You mean you were.

409
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,426
JJ never would've gotten past us
if you hadn't abandoned your post.

410
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,701
Oh, you think this is
my fault?

411
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,637
What I think is that you need
to stop going rogue

412
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,264
and start acting like
you're part of this team.

413
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,249
Hey, guys, can we save it
for the Deathstrokes?

414
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,585
Speaking of your evil brother
and his masked maniacs,

415
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,420
we're gonna talk
about that, right?

416
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,881
Wrong. What do you got?

417
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,343
Nothing good. Ever since
we brought down the wall, your broth...

418
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,763
the Deathstroke gang has
really upped their game.

419
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,264
They've amassed more territory
and power than ever before.

420
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,591
Unintended
consequences.

421
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,002
Yeah. But that doesn't explain
why they went after Vasquez.

422
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,302
Vasquez is one of the Glades'
wealthiest citizens.

423
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,231
Maybe the Deathstrokes
plan to extort him.

424
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,209
Yeah, that or they're
planning to ransom him off.

425
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,503
Either way, this guy's screwed
if we don't find him soon.

426
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,569
Way ahead of you.

427
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,589
Satellite imaging indicates
that the Deathstrokes

428
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,813
have assumed control
of the old Galaxy One headquarters.

429
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,093
It could be where they're
holding Vasquez.

430
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,785
If he's even
still alive.

431
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,871
There's only one
way to find out. Suit up.

432
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,463
Let me guess. When Mom and
O.G. Team Arrow anointed us version 2.0,

433
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,007
you expected things to go
a little better, right?

434
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,397
I'm sure they had
their growing pains, too.

435
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,847
I know that working

436
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,557
and playing well
with others is still

437
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,768
a new concept for you,
but do you think

438
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,187
you could just follow
Connor's lead this one time?

439
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,749
I mean, the guy is
a Knightwatch agent.

440
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,626
He eats, sleeps,
and breathes tactical operations.

441
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,360
Yeah. And our target
is his own brother.

442
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,340
I believe that fate brought
the four of us together for a reason

443
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,528
just like it
did our parents

444
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,326
when they decided
to save this city.

445
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:45,915
Now it's our turn.

446
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,237
We don't want to mess
it up, do we?

447
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:31,836
How'd you find me?

448
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,755
- Tracking your shoe.
- Really?

449
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,065
Just kidding. That was
the way I found you

450
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,358
last time this
happened, remember?

451
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,822
Yeah. Yeah. It's not the only
history that's repeating itself.

452
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,888
Tommy's planning his
very own Undertaking.

453
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,974
Don't worry. We'll stop him.

454
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:47,977
John, I appreciate
the assist,

455
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,624
but I still have to
do this on my own.

456
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,648
Right, because you think
you have to die, right?

457
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:53,983
No. I know
I'm gonna die.

458
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,870
And I know that I don't
have to accept that.

459
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,073
If I let you help me,
you will get hurt or you will get killed.

460
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,532
And it will be
because of me.

461
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,576
- You don't know that.
- I do know that.

462
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,413
Because everyone else
in my life is either dead or alone.

463
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,208
Look at the Earth
that we're on.

464
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,001
I've been gone 12 years.

465
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,420
My mother's alive.
Tommy's alive.

466
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:15,588
Laurel's alive.

467
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,341
Thea is dead.

468
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,426
And, yes, Tommy's alive.

469
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,972
But he's trying another Undertaking
with Rene and Dinah helping,

470
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,517
who, if you haven't noticed,
are very bad people here.

471
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,185
Oliver, this world
isn't better.

472
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,561
It's much, much worse.

473
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,021
You know why?

474
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,899
Because you weren't in it.

475
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,255
I've known you long enough to know
I can't talk you out of this.

476
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,950
You better have
a good plan.

477
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,417
Oh, look who it is,
and you brought a friend

478
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,043
to my secret bunker.

479
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,420
I've been here before.

480
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:56,754
Oh, great.
You're here, too.

481
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:00,049
Uh, Adrian,
this is John Diggle.

482
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,343
He's my... bodyguard.

483
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,928
You need a bodyguard?

484
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,680
He's not a bodyguard.

485
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,867
And I thought you
didn't need our help.

486
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,019
I've been wrong before.
The Dark Archer stole dwarf star particles

487
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,272
and is planning to use them
to level the Glades tonight.

488
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,481
And you know that how?

489
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,088
Because I
was just with him.

490
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,277
Tommy Merlyn is
the Dark Archer.

491
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,029
Are you sure?

492
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,781
He blames the Glades for
what happened to Thea.

493
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,619
If you wanted to level
an entire neighborhood,

494
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,079
how would you do it?

495
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,020
I'd use
an Earthquake machine.

496
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,167
That sounds like
science fiction to me.

497
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,503
And Merlyn stole
dwarf star particles,

498
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,381
which would make for
a very real weapon.

499
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,634
Overlaying the blast radius
with a map of the Glades

500
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,887
should allow us to pinpoint
its optimal location.

501
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,098
He's like you, Curtis,
and Felicity all rolled up in one.

502
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,684
I could only narrow it
down to 4 square blocks.

503
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,770
So we split up,
find it on foot.

504
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,855
No, we don't. Thea
died in the Glades.

505
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,690
We find out where,
we find Tommy.

506
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,209
What are you,
some kind of psychic?

507
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,152
Maybe I'm just
10 steps ahead of you.

508
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,992
4587 Burke,

509
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,244
favorite hangout of
the Glades' worst drug dealers.

510
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,537
Good. That's where we head.

511
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,164
Suit up.

512
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,008
Tommy could be anywhere inside.

513
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,719
Start at the ground floor.
Work our way up.

514
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:29,722
Let's do this.

515
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,170
You should've stayed
on that island.

516
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,449
Back on my Earth,
you had a better teacher.

517
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,360
You don't
have to do this.

518
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,646
I was thinking
the same thing.

519
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,422
This is not what Thea
would have wanted.

520
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:48,009
That's funny. You know
what she used to say?

521
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:49,969
The dead don't want
anything.

522
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,430
It's one of the benefits
of being dead.

523
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,018
Tommy.

524
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:56,077
You can't. It's encrypted
by my personal code.

525
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,913
You can't break it in time.

526
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,040
You can.

527
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,921
I know how devastating
it must have been

528
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,967
to lose Thea because
we're only as good

529
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,929
as the people we have
in our lives.

530
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,557
I lost people, too,
Tommy.

531
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,561
I lost people
closer to me

532
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,271
than I could possibly
explain to you.

533
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:26,983
Every one of those losses
brings with it a choice

534
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,444
between darkness
and light.

535
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,658
Make the right
choice.

536
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:41,122
Are you gonna kill thousands
of innocent people,

537
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,751
or are you gonna be the man
I know you are?

538
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,365
That was
a pretty good speech.

539
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:34,258
As agreed. The dwarf star particles
that power Merlyn's weapon.

540
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:36,719
Thank you.

541
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,947
And now you're gonna tell me
what you're gonna do with them?

542
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,433
Not destroy a city.
Don't worry.

543
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,604
You're from a parallel universe,
aren't you?

544
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:48,898
The Hood from
another reality?

545
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,316
How did you know
that?

546
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:54,070
Bruce Wayne once told me
that if you eliminate the impossible,

547
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:58,240
whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth.

548
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,662
Well, as The Hood from
a parallel universe,

549
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:03,996
may I offer you
some advice?

550
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:06,749
Change "The Hood" to
Green Arrow.

551
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,126
Trust me.

552
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,801
Why do I get the sense
that you guys

553
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,720
won't be sticking around
for a victory drink?

554
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:22,264
We have to get
back home to our Earth.

555
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,976
This city's lucky to have
a hero like you in it.

556
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:32,733
Wow. That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

557
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:34,652
Thank you.

558
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,029
You take care of yourself...

559
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,781
both of you.

560
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,911
You okay?

561
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,247
I'm alive.

562
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,024
You say that like it's
a bad thing.

563
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,834
Well, it's a temporary
thing, John.

564
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,210
Oliver, you
don't know that.

565
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,587
And I don't know this
Monitor, but what I do know,

566
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,423
that no one's fate
is sealed.

567
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,508
- He saw me die.
- In the future...

568
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,760
which means we can still
prevent this.

569
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,127
Oliver, you're not
alone in this.

570
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,434
Well, not anymore.

571
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,519
Thanks for having
my back.

572
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,897
Always.
Now, can we go home now?

573
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,029
Just one more thing
I got to do.

574
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:29,957
We'd better find
Vasquez fast.

575
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,393
<i>Where to, William?</i>

576
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,002
Top floor, southwest
corner office.

577
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,795
And JJ's got at least
4 friends.

578
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,732
The second I walk through
that door, JJ's gonna try

579
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,090
to run a sword
through my chest.

580
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,017
But that should keep him
occupied long enough

581
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,594
for you to rescue Vasquez.

582
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,971
Whoa. You're using
yourself as bait?

583
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:48,768
Yeah. And it'll work,
too. Trust me.

584
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:53,898
Whatever you want,
I'll give it to you.

585
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,441
Please stop.

586
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,110
The codes.

587
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,162
This better be everything.

588
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,414
It is. I swear.

589
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:16,170
Okay.

590
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,803
What's up, JJ?

591
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,431
- Miss me?
- Kill his ass.

592
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,679
Come on. Let's get you
out of here.

593
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,583
You think that you can
save this city?

594
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,254
I got news for you.
I own this city now.

595
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,428
Mia!

596
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,349
I am so sorry, okay?
I underestimated him.

597
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,976
It will never happen again.

598
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,144
No, it won't, because
from now on,

599
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,813
we're gonna do
things my way.

600
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,155
Hey.

601
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,323
Hey.

602
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,660
You okay?

603
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,620
I don't know.

604
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:36,625
I haven't known anything
since Thea died.

605
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,295
I understand that.

606
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:40,754
I don't know, Ollie.

607
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,841
Just I... I can't shake
this feeling...

608
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,762
that our sister would
still be alive if you had...

609
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,391
if you'd just been here.

610
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,853
I've made my own mistakes.

611
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,481
Oh, God.

612
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:01,811
Tommy, are you ok?

613
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,528
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you out of here.

614
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:08,991
I am so sorry.

615
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,204
I have to go.

616
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:16,832
Mom?

617
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:27,551
Bye, mom.

618
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,304
I love you.

619
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:31,889
I love you, too.

620
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,601
Hey.

621
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,896
I'll see you at the house.

622
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,064
Okay.

623
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:48,113
- All good?
- Let's go home.

624
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:57,915
What's going on?

625
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,086
My computer
went down!

626
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,048
Oh, good.
You're still here.

627
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,425
What's going on?

628
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:09,760
The city's under attack.

629
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:10,928
By who?

630
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,025
We have to get
the hell out of here.

631
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,352
- And go where?
- Home. Cisco's device.

632
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:33,367
- Oliver?
- Mom?

633
