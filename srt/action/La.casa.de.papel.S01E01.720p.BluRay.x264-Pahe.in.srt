THE FACTS AND SCENARIOS REPRESENTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:07,881
Stop or I'll shoot!

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:08,841
No!

4
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,521
<i>My name's Tokio.</i>

5
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,921
<i>But when this story started,
that wasn't my name.</i>

6
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:33,721
<i>This was me.</i>

7
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:35,041
SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

8
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,641
<i>And this, the love of my life.</i>

9
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:39,681
ROBBER GETS SHOT DEAD

10
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:42,121
<i>The last time I saw him
I left him in a pool of blood</i>

11
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,081
<i>with his eyes open.</i>

12
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,281
<i>We did 15 clean robberies,</i>

13
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,521
<i>but mixing love and work never works.</i>

14
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:53,561
<i>So, when the security guard shot,
I had to change my job.</i>

15
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:57,121
<i>From robber to murderer.</i>

16
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:59,641
<i>And that's how I started to run away.</i>

17
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,041
<i>Somehow, I was dead too.</i>

18
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,081
<i>Or almost dead.</i>

19
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:27,721
<i>I had been hidden for 11 days</i>

20
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,201
<i>and my photo wallpapered
police stations all over Spain.</i>

21
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:32,761
<i>I'd get a 30 years' sentence.</i>

22
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,281
<i>And I'm really not the type of girl
who likes getting old</i>

23
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,521
<i>in the cell of a prison.</i>

24
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,481
<i>I prefer running away.</i>

25
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,601
<i>Body and soul.</i>

26
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,201
<i>And if I can't take my body there,</i>

27
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,161
<i>at least let my soul escape.</i>

28
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,801
<i>I had no time left and there were
important things I had to do.</i>

29
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,521
<i>Just one, really.</i>

30
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:05,281
Hello?

31
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,321
<i>Mum?</i>

32
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:09,801
Oh, my girl.

33
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:12,721
<i>How are you, sweetheart?</i>

34
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:15,761
What's happening?

35
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:17,481
<i>Haven't you seen the news?</i>

36
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,881
All those things they say about me.

37
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,321
Yes, of course I've seen them.

38
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:25,961
You know what?

39
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,761
I'm thinking about going on a journey.

40
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,601
<i>I may join a Chinese ship.</i>

41
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:32,961
<i>As a cook.</i>

42
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,401
<i>Didn't you say
I couldn't even make an omelette?</i>

43
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,921
<i>So I'll learn. What do you think?</i>

44
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:39,121
I don't know, sweetheart.

45
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,201
What if they only eat Chinese food?

46
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,841
What does that journey mean,

47
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,201
<i>that I won't see you again?</i>

48
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,241
Don't talk nonsense.

49
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,881
Of course you'll see me.

50
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,081
<i>I'll buy you a ticket
so you come to visit me.</i>

51
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,601
Visit you where?

52
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,081
At the cemetery?

53
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,641
Are you alone?

54
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:11,121
<i>Mum, are you alone?</i>

55
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,521
Yes.

56
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:15,561
<i>Then go to the street,
as if you went to the market.</i>

57
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,001
<i>I'll find you.</i>

58
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,001
<i>And that day,
the day I was going to the slaughterhouse,</i>

59
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,201
<i>my guardian angel appeared.</i>

60
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:30,321
<i>But you never know for certain
what a guardian angel looks like,</i>

61
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:33,721
<i>and you'd never imagine
he'd appear in a Seat Ibiza</i>

62
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:35,241
<i>of 1992.</i>

63
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,081
Excuse me, have you got a minute?

64
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:39,921
No.

65
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,361
Cooking in a Chinese ship
only has one advantage,

66
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:52,321
you don't have to do the washing-up.

67
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,401
<i>For a moment I thought about the Chinese</i>

68
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,841
<i>and that I hate people who spit.</i>

69
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,961
- Who are you, a policeman?
- Wait, wait.

70
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,881
You're going to the slaughterhouse,
there's a squad waiting for you

71
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,601
and they have a car since six days ago...

72
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,921
Why would I believe you?

73
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,641
<i>And that's how I met the Profesor,</i>

74
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:18,321
<i>pointing a gun to his balls.</i>

75
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,241
May I?

76
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:21,041
<i>The good thing about relationships</i>

77
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,361
<i>is that you finally forget
how they started.</i>

78
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:24,601
May I?

79
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,361
They're already in your mother's house.

80
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,081
That's why I came to help you.

81
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:53,721
I want to propose you some business,

82
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,281
a robbery, a robbery that's...

83
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,241
singular.

84
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,481
I'm looking for people who...

85
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,521
Well, people who don't have much to lose.

86
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,801
What do you think about...

87
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:15,561
2400 million euros?

88
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,361
<i>Nobody had done a job like that,</i>

89
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:24,481
<i>neither in New York,
nor in London, nor in Monte Carlo.</i>

90
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,721
<i>So if my picture was again in the papers,</i>

91
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,441
<i>at least it'd be due
to the biggest robbery ever.</i>

92
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,161
WELCOME

93
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,201
I welcome you

94
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:19,201
and... I thank you
for having accepted this...

95
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:22,281
this job offer.

96
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,041
We'll live here,
far from the worldly noise.

97
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:33,281
Five months, the five months
we'll spend studying

98
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,961
- how to do the job.
- What do you mean, five months?

99
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:37,601
Are we crazy?

100
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:44,201
Look, people spend years studying

101
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:48,081
to earn a salary,
a salary which, in the best of cases,

102
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,961
is just a salary, a shitty salary.

103
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,601
What are five months?

104
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:58,161
I've been thinking about this...

105
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:02,601
for much longer.

106
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,361
Not to have to work ever again.

107
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,881
Neither you

108
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:14,201
nor your children.

109
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:22,961
Okay.

110
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,001
You don't know each other yet
and I want it go on like that.

111
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:30,041
I don't want any names,
or personal questions,

112
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,201
or, of course, personal relationships.

113
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,961
I want each of you to choose a name,
something simple.

114
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,841
It can be numbers, planets, cities...

115
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:45,561
- Like "Mister 17, miss 23."
- That's a wrong start. I can't

116
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:48,401
- remember my telephone number.
- That's why I said that.

117
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:53,761
- And planets?
- I can be Mars, and he Uranus.

118
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:55,881
I won't be Uranus, so forget it.

119
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,681
- What's the matter with Uranus?
- I don't like the rhyme.

120
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,921
- It'll be cities. Cities.
- So cities it is.

121
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:03,521
Okay.

122
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,841
<i>That's why I ended up being Tokio.</i>

123
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,161
<i>The one looking at my arse is Mr. Berlín.</i>

124
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:10,601
<i>Under arrest warrant.</i>

125
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,121
<i>27 robberies.</i>

126
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,601
<i>Jewelleries, auction houses
and security vans.</i>

127
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:18,001
<i>His biggest job,
the Champs Elysees, in Paris.</i>

128
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,441
<i>434 diamonds.</i>

129
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,801
<i>He's like a shark in a swimming pool.</i>

130
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,441
<i>You can swim with him,
but you're never calm.</i>

131
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,401
<i>And he was the boss
in charge of the assault.</i>

132
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:30,321
<i>The one who coughs is Mr. Moscú.</i>

133
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:33,561
<i>The first thing he dug was a mine,
in Asturias.</i>

134
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:34,761
MOSCOW

135
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,921
<i>Then he understood
that digging upwards he'd go further.</i>

136
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:41,241
<i>Six fur shops, three clock shops
and the Caja Rural in Avilés.</i>

137
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,841
<i>He uses the thermal lance
and any industrial equipment.</i>

138
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,081
<i>The one sitting
behind Moscú is Denver, his son.</i>

139
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:51,881
<i>Drugs, teeth, broken ribs.</i>

140
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:54,401
<i>He's the king of fights in discos.</i>

141
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:55,881
<i>Pure hot blood.</i>

142
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,561
<i>In a perfect plan, a time bomb.</i>

143
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,561
<i>Río. He's my weakness.</i>

144
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:06,641
<i>He's like Mozart, but with computers.</i>

145
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:11,641
<i>He programmes since he was six and knows
everything about alarms and electronics.</i>

146
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:14,361
<i>For the rest of things in life
it's as if he had been born yesterday.</i>

147
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,081
<i>And those are the Siamese twins,
Helsinki and Oslo.</i>

148
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:20,921
<i>Even the most sophisticated plan
needs soldiers</i>

149
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:22,521
<i>and who better than two Serbs.</i>

150
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:25,681
<i>Maybe they think,
but, frankly, we'll never know.</i>

151
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:28,121
<i>Nairobi,</i>

152
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,201
<i>a hardened optimist.</i>

153
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,921
<i>She has forged banknotes
since she was 13.</i>

154
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,921
<i>And now she's our quality manager.</i>

155
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:39,201
<i>She might be crazy,
but she's really funny.</i>

156
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:44,761
Think that every day
they'll talk about us in the news,

157
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:48,121
every family in the country
will be wondering

158
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,001
what we're doing.

159
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,041
And you know what they'll think?

160
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,721
They'll think: "Bastards!
I wish I had come up with that idea."

161
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:01,961
<i>The Profesor,
no criminal record, no register.</i>

162
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:05,241
<i>The last time he renewed
his ID he was 19.</i>

163
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:09,801
<i>To all intents, a ghost,
but a very smart ghost.</i>

164
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:13,641
We're not stealing... anybody's money,

165
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,321
because they'll even think we're nice.

166
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,641
And that is vital.

167
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:22,761
It's vital we have the public opinion
on our side.

168
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,641
We're going to be the fucking heroes
of all those people.

169
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,761
But very careful,
because the moment there is

170
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:37,161
a single drop of blood,
this is very important,

171
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,441
if there's a single victim,

172
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:44,361
we'll stop being Robin Hoods
and we'll simply become sons of a bitch.

173
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:46,561
Profesor.

174
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:49,641
Miss Tokio.

175
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,601
What are we going to steal?

176
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,121
The Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.

177
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,041
DAY OF THE ROBBERY
FRIDAY 8:35 A.M.

178
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,161
Who chose the mask?

179
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,721
- What's up with the mask?
- It's not scary.

180
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,681
In bank robbery films
the masks are scary.

181
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:37,361
They're zombies, skeletons,
the death, I don't know, you feel...

182
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,121
With a gun in your hand

183
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:42,241
I assure you a madman
is scarier than a skeleton.

184
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:44,481
- Stop it.
- Who was this guy with the moustache?

185
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:49,961
Dalí, son, a Spanish painter.
He was very good.

186
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,041
- A painter.
- Yes.

187
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,841
- A painter of paintings.
- Yes.

188
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:59,161
Do you know what's fucking scary?
Dolls for children.

189
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,841
They're really scary.

190
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,801
What dolls?

191
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:05,001
Goofy, Pluto, Mickey Mouse, all those.

192
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,681
A mouse with ears is scarier,
that's what you're saying?

193
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:09,721
Yes, arsehole.
Do you want me to wallop you?

194
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,841
- Hey!
- I'm right. Listen to me.

195
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:15,121
If a guy at gunpoint
and wearing a Mickey Mouse mask

196
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,481
gets in a place,
the people will think he's nuts,

197
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,481
there's going to be a massacre.
Do you know why?

198
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,881
Because guns and children

199
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,881
are two things
you never put together, daddy.

200
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,041
- Am I right or not?
- That way it'd be more dangerous,

201
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,041
more twisted.

202
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:32,201
So a Jesus Christ mask
would frighten more, he's more innocent.

203
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,921
They say "It doesn't suit you,
it's like Christ with two guns."

204
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:37,441
- "Like a saint with two guns."
- It doesn't matter.

205
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:40,041
<i>It was obvious
there was a lack of women in the gang.</i>

206
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,641
<i>A woman can spend two days
choosing shoes for a wedding,</i>

207
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:47,681
<i>but she'd never use a single minute
to choose masks for a robbery.</i>

208
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,481
<i>Everything we had planned was starting now</i>

209
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,201
<i>and during those fractions of a second
I thought about all the innocent people</i>

210
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,641
<i>whose lives we would stop
in their tracks.</i>

211
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:26,721
E-80 LOCAL ROAD

212
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,881
<i>The Profesor knew
there was just one way to come</i>

213
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,081
<i>in the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre
with three tonnes</i>

214
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,921
<i>of explosive devices.
It had to be done in the lorry</i>

215
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,841
<i>that entered the building every week</i>

216
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:38,561
<i>with the new paper money rolls
ready to be printed.</i>

217
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,641
<i>And that was what we were going to do,</i>

218
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:46,121
<i>getting to the very core,
escorted by the National Police.</i>

219
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:56,401
<i>In Spain, anything guarded
by two police cars</i>

220
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,641
<i>is something heavily protected.</i>

221
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:03,081
<i>But if you inhibit any possibility</i>

222
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,561
<i>for their communication
through the radio or telephone</i>

223
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:09,521
<i>and if you point two 26-year-old kids
with five assault rifles at their heads,</i>

224
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,241
<i>it doesn't matter if they have guns,</i>

225
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,481
<i>and they feel just like it'd happen
to any of us.</i>

226
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,321
I said get out of the fucking car!

227
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,721
<i>- They're scared shitless.</i>
- You'll do as I say!

228
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:21,881
<i>Courage and heroism have a price,</i>

229
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,921
<i>and it's greater
than the 1600 euros a month</i>

230
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,921
<i>- a kid with a uniform gets...</i>
- Open the lorry, do you hear me?

231
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,281
<i>... or a lorry driver.</i>

232
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,481
Come on, damn it, open!

233
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,881
<i>If those men had had their daughter
on the back of the lorry,</i>

234
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:39,361
<i>they'd never have opened it,
but who cares about</i>

235
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,321
<i>some paper money rolls
with a watermark?</i>

236
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:46,761
Hurry up, hurry up!

237
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,401
Jeez, man! Come on!

238
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,481
Come on, come on!

239
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:58,001
Sit down. Now calm down, the three of you,
otherwise, a blow with the rifle.

240
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,601
You'll drive with a gun in your kidneys.

241
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:05,201
When you get the radio call
to know if everything's all right,

242
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:08,321
you'll answer coolly,
as if everything ran smoothly.

243
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:09,961
Am I clear?

244
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,481
<i>And in the middle of that chaos with guns</i>

245
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:19,401
<i>I remembered the night before
I had been asked for my hand in marriage</i>

246
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,921
<i>and that I'd have preferred other plans.</i>

247
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,801
<i>But if you think about it,
you never find a good day for a robbery.</i>

248
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,081
Now you know what you have to do.

249
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,281
Don't take your eyes off the girl.

250
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:34,241
There can't be any mistakes, all right?

251
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:35,881
She's 17.

252
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,441
I think I can handle her.

253
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,921
"Can I sit by your side?"

254
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:26,921
"Sure".

255
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,441
Hello.

256
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:42,961
Hello.

257
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,081
Do you want to go out with me?

258
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,601
Okay. I'm leaving.

259
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,281
No, no.

260
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,241
I don't have to think about it.

261
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:05,601
I mean, yes.

262
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:38,201
<i>Okay, children, we've arrived.</i>

263
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:41,081
<i>Let's go straight
to the museum's hall, where...</i>

264
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,161
<i>Pedro, please, don't behave like in class.</i>

265
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:46,121
<i>Let's go out in an orderly way,
using both doors...</i>

266
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:58,201
And this is the façade
of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

267
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:06,681
The little lamb is coming in.

268
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,161
Perfect.

269
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:12,921
Berlín, your turn.

270
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:21,481
And now, be careful what you do.

271
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,321
How are you, Javi? Where's Rafita?

272
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:27,961
Shift change.

273
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,681
Very well. Keep calm.

274
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:42,121
Okay, children, get in.

275
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,441
Slowly.

276
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,881
This is important.
As soon as we get the accreditations...

277
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,961
Keep you accreditations
hanging from your neck.

278
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,601
They must be visible
during the whole visit, okay?

279
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:13,521
Don't turn around.

280
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:17,241
When you're next to me,
I can't even breathe.

281
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,121
Well, breathe,

282
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:22,401
because in nine months
you will really be out of breath.

283
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,481
Go ahead.

284
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:39,161
Well visible during the whole visit,
children.

285
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:43,081
The accreditation in your neck.
Lower your voice.

286
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,601
Berlín, the first camera, on your left.

287
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:20,121
Aren't you going to say anything?

288
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:22,081
I tell you I'm pregnant,
and you just keep calm?

289
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:25,121
What shall I do, call my wife,
tell her to pick up the children

290
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,321
and we all go to celebrate?
For God's sake!

291
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,801
Go on, go on. Come on.

292
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:37,921
ACCESS TO SECURITY SYSTEM

293
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:39,241
Coming in.

294
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:41,641
Be alert, Tokio.

295
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,641
ACCESS TO ALARM SYSTEM

296
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:50,921
Great!

297
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,321
<i>- Alarms disengaged.</i>
- Now.

298
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:59,681
Go ahead, come on.

299
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:02,801
It was you who said yesterday
you're in a bad situation,

300
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:06,481
- you can't stand her, you have problems.
- Problems just like any couple, Mónica,

301
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,681
like any other married couple
with three children,

302
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,201
not that I want to get divorced.

303
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:24,201
Mónica, I've had three children,
all of them with in vitro fertilisation.

304
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:27,361
I've been having sterile intercourses
with my wife for over 20 years

305
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:28,561
and now you tell me this.

306
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,801
You must be Shiva,
the goddess of fertility.

307
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,401
What are you insinuating?

308
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,801
I didn't come here
looking for a pension, you know?

309
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:57,521
Or for a divorce,

310
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,921
and much less for a paternity test.

311
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,121
I thought you loved me.

312
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:12,401
And...

313
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,441
And I think it's a nice idea.

314
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:21,241
Hard to make it fit in our lives, but...

315
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,961
but a wonderful idea.

316
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,441
Listen!

317
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:47,761
What? Do you want to know
what I'm going to do with your child?

318
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:51,041
- That's what you want, right?
- Listen to me, don't rush.

319
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,321
Don't move!

320
00:23:58,561 --> 00:23:59,721
Freeze.

321
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,961
Don't move! Don't move or I'll kill you!

322
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,721
- What's the matter? Do something!
- Stand up! Stand up!

323
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:12,081
Get out!

324
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,121
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

325
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:21,481
Hurry up! Don't move!

326
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:24,081
Come on, come on!

327
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:25,481
Come on!

328
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:26,521
Yes, yes!

329
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:33,761
Fuck!

330
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:41,601
Come on, come on.

331
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:43,841
This way. Come on.

332
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:52,361
And this wonderful staircase,
made of marble and granite...

333
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:53,361
Don't move!

334
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,361
Don't move!

335
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:06,121
Don't move! Come on!

336
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:07,041
Get back!

337
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:11,001
- Please, don't!
- Profesor, we have a problem.

338
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,201
I can't see the little lamb.

339
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:14,961
I can't fucking see her!

340
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:19,801
Miss Parker, where have you gone?

341
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:40,601
Wait.

342
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,841
- Please!
- Let's go! That way!

343
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:59,761
Stop. Stop.

344
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:01,161
Okay.

345
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:04,361
Okay, okay.

346
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,521
I'm going too fast. I know.

347
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,401
Let's immortalize this, right?

348
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,241
Let's take a picture with your phone.

349
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:22,001
Wait...

350
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:23,161
Jesus...

351
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:27,681
Here? It's a bit seedy, right?

352
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,441
It's our first day.

353
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,241
You look so pretty.

354
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,801
I can't find the girl.
I can't fucking see her.

355
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:45,401
Open here. Open and look a bit sexy.

356
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:53,321
It's your phone.
If you want, you can erase it.

357
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,521
This is for both of us, for you and me.

358
00:26:58,481 --> 00:26:59,721
Come on, come on.

359
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:17,801
With this photo
you'll be all the rage on the Internet.

360
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,721
Give me my phone! I said give it to me!

361
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:23,681
Give me my phone! Give it to me!

362
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,601
Give me the fucking phone!
Give me the phone!

363
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:28,721
Give me the phone!

364
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:30,281
Give me the phone!

365
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:16,121
First of all...

366
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,121
Good morning.

367
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,761
I'm the person who's in charge.

368
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,641
And, first of all, I want...

369
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,041
to offer my apologies.

370
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,201
Truly, this is not the way
to end the week.

371
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,161
Phone.

372
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:45,921
But you're here as hostages.

373
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:50,521
Phone.

374
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,801
If you obey,
I guarantee you'll be left alive.

375
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,921
- Name.
- Alison Parker.

376
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:57,761
- PIN.
- 2078.

377
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:01,921
Phone.

378
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:06,481
Calm down, calm down.

379
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,361
Calm down.

380
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:09,361
PIN.

381
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:11,841
Why do you need the PIN?

382
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:16,081
Either you tell me the fucking PIN
or I'll blow you with my rifle butt.

383
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,081
How long are you pregnant for?

384
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:20,241
Eight months.

385
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:21,361
Eight months.

386
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,441
- PIN.
- 1234.

387
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:29,001
You look so smart,

388
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:31,601
but you've got that shitty PIN.
What an arsehole. Your name.

389
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,841
- Arturo.
- Arturo what?

390
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:35,641
- Arturo Román.
- Arturo Román, very well. Arturito.

391
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:39,681
You're our safe-conduct here,
so I'm going to protect you.

392
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:45,161
Hey...

393
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,361
Give me your hands. Let go.

394
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,721
Let go. Let go.

395
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:57,841
What's your name?

396
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:00,961
Ariadna.

397
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,321
Ariadna.

398
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,681
Come with me. Come.

399
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:08,881
Calm down.

400
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,721
Feel my hands.

401
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:14,481
- Are they the hands of a monster?
- No, no.

402
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:16,241
Because I'm not a monster.

403
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:19,921
I know perfectly how you feel.

404
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:25,161
The dry mouth, the shortness of breath...
You have to try to calm down. Breathe in.

405
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,441
Breathe in.

406
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:28,881
Breathe in.

407
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:32,201
That's it.
Please, breathe with me, all of you.

408
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,681
Breathe in.

409
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,241
Easy, easy.

410
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:41,521
Make yourself responsible
for your breathing. Breathe out.

411
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:45,281
Very well. Very well.

412
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:53,081
Miss Mónica Gaztambide, please?

413
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,481
Don't move. Please, don't move.

414
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:58,441
- Be quiet.
- I said don't move.

415
00:30:58,521 --> 00:30:59,481
Be quiet.

416
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:02,881
Miss Mónica Gaztambide,

417
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,841
would you be so kind as to step forward?

418
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:09,201
It's me.

419
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:01,961
You're a star, dad!

420
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,841
You're the best!

421
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,121
You can sleep very well here, dad.

422
00:32:43,201 --> 00:32:45,401
You can sleep grandly here.

423
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,361
Oh! Dad, dad!

424
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,681
Fucking. Here, boom!

425
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:52,001
Boom, boom...

426
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:54,961
Come on, stop fooling around
and let's get to work. Come on, jeez.

427
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,801
This smells fucking great.

428
00:32:57,881 --> 00:33:00,681
It smells better than roast lamb,
dad, that roast lamb.

429
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,761
- Lay down here, jeez.
- Come on, Jesus!

430
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:05,441
When have you had such a bed?
You didn't have it in jail.

431
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:08,881
Have you seen where we are, dad?
We're the best.

432
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:11,761
- We're the best.
- Boy, don't get this wrong.

433
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:15,041
We're very small.

434
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:18,481
Can you do anything?

435
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,521
Have you ever had a job?

436
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:23,161
Have you ever left you CV anywhere?

437
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:25,321
Ah. Come on, jeez.

438
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,161
My CV.

439
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:33,361
My CV, what for?

440
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,841
To take you out of Alcalá-Meco?

441
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:49,201
Do you think I feel proud of that?

442
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:53,881
12 years of my life
coming in and out of prison.

443
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:55,841
And you know why?

444
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:57,841
Why?

445
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,481
Because I'm not very smart, son.

446
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,121
And neither are you.

447
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,881
But the brains of this job
is another person.

448
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,921
And if we're lucky
and you don't act like an arsehole,

449
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:15,041
you'll leave this place
with your life settled.

450
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:17,401
- I'm not acting like an arsehole.
- Come on, jeez!

451
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:19,201
Fill them.

452
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,041
I want you to answer the phone

453
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:27,961
and convince whoever it is
that we are closed

454
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,641
- due to a technical problem. Understood?
- Yes.

455
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:37,321
I have no choice
but to point at you with a gun.

456
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,481
- Can you feel it?
- Yes.

457
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:41,321
Good.

458
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:44,961
Now.

459
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:54,761
Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre, tell me.

460
00:34:55,681 --> 00:34:58,841
No, I'm sorry, I can't put you
through Arturo right now.

461
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,121
The system is down.

462
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,281
No, I can't bring him up here.

463
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:07,121
No, he can't come here
to pick up the phone.

464
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:10,321
No, it can't be.

465
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:11,921
No, because...

466
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:17,201
Just because,
I don't know where he is right now,

467
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,961
I don't know if he's in the factory,
in the museum, in the canteen

468
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,521
or wherever he is!
And besides, that's not my job, miss!

469
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,081
That was a performance worthy of an Oscar,
miss Gaztambide.

470
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:50,801
<i>20 minutes after coming in,
we started to wire</i>

471
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,481
<i>the analogue communication system
to talk to the Profesor.</i>

472
00:35:56,321 --> 00:36:00,201
<i>Without phones or radio frequency,
with nobody being able to hear us.</i>

473
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:03,961
<i>We had sealed the doors
and the alarms hadn't set off.</i>

474
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:07,281
<i>We were like in a time limbo,
with nobody knowing</i>

475
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:09,841
<i>we had taken over
the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.</i>

476
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:13,601
<i>And in that sweet peace, before the storm,</i>

477
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:15,641
<i>it just seemed</i>

478
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:18,321
<i>an ordinary day.</i>

479
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:33,761
You look handsome, right?

480
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:56,121
Who is it?

481
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:57,921
It's me, let me in.

482
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:13,561
Río, man. If the Profesor sees us,
he'll kill us, don't you know?

483
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:16,361
I know, I know.
I have to talk to you. Sit down.

484
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,161
- What's up?
- Sit down, jeez.

485
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:20,761
What's up?

486
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:22,361
Tomorrow's the robbery.

487
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,361
And we have no fucking idea
what is going to happen.

488
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:32,561
That's why I want you to know
I'm serious with you

489
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:36,961
and I understand perfectly that, well,
that you're not a child any more and...

490
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:41,121
and you may be looking for...
a more serious commitment.

491
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:45,721
That's why I want to give you something.

492
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:52,481
I didn't buy you a ring
because we're locked up here,

493
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:55,321
but as soon as I go out
I'll buy you such a big gem

494
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:58,201
you'll need to carry your hand
in a fucking wheelbarrow.

495
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,681
What's this?

496
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:04,801
An engagement badge?

497
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,841
Now at least you'll know my real name.

498
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:11,001
Right, but we're not allowed
to know each other's names.

499
00:38:11,361 --> 00:38:13,121
Well, don't look at it.

500
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:15,121
But it's yours.

501
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,441
How should I tell you this?

502
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:26,801
Our affair has been very well, okay?
Great.

503
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,001
We have slept together some evenings...

504
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:34,321
What do you mean, some?
Jeez, all of them. But four or five...

505
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,801
Sincerely, I don't think
we're the perfect couple.

506
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:43,641
- Don't we fuck well?
- Yes, we do fuck well, wonderfully.

507
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,081
That's a start, right?

508
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:48,721
But you need something more
than fucking well to be a couple, right?

509
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,281
Are you saying that because
I'm 12 years younger than you?

510
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:56,281
I'm going to have
300 million euros, right?

511
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:58,481
I'm not a child, my life is settled.

512
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:01,361
- Really, Río, I wish we had...
- What do you mean with "had"?

513
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:05,121
There was love. There was, I was there.

514
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,121
There's another man, right?

515
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:19,561
Not anymore.

516
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,401
Look, Río,

517
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:27,041
when all this is over,
maybe you and I will go to Tahiti

518
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,561
and see if this works, but tomorrow
I only want to think about one thing:

519
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,081
not to get killed.

520
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:44,641
Río.

521
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,801
Río, don't.

522
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:24,761
No, no.

523
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:26,801
You left a phone on.

524
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,041
Well, turn it off.

525
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:44,361
The vault is open.

526
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,881
Put on your vests and get ready to go out.

527
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:51,201
As soon as you're ready,
we'll activate the alarm.

528
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,761
Berlín, ready to open the doors.

529
00:40:56,441 --> 00:41:00,841
Hostages, for your security,
all of you three steps back!

530
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:04,201
A little more over here. Very well.

531
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:06,641
Okay. Everything's going to be all right.

532
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:10,361
A little closer.

533
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,161
Calm down.

534
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:28,001
Calm down. I can see the bags.
They're full of money.

535
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,961
Now they'll leave and it'll be all right.

536
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:57,521
<i>There's a 10-33 at the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.</i>

537
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,801
<i>Z24 on our way.
We'll get there in two minutes.</i>

538
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:00,841
Two minutes.

539
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:02,601
Two minutes.

540
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:10,521
- Why did the alarm go off?
- I don't know.

541
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,841
They're just standing there,
I don't understand.

542
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,921
- Why don't they take the money and leave?
- I don't know!

543
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:21,321
One minute, 40 seconds.

544
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:23,561
One minute...

545
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,241
What's your name?

546
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:32,801
Arturo.

547
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:36,161
- Arturo, right?
- Yes. No, I haven't seen anything!

548
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:38,681
I haven't seen anything, I swear,
I haven't seen anything!

549
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:40,921
- Look at me.
- I haven't seen anything.

550
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,201
Come on, Arturo, look at me.

551
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:44,681
Look at me, look at me.

552
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:47,321
Hey, hey, come on.

553
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:50,801
Hey.

554
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:54,641
Do you like cinema?

555
00:42:58,401 --> 00:42:59,241
Do you like it?

556
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:04,081
I'm... I'm a big fan.

557
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:10,201
Have you realised in horror films

558
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,961
there's always someone at the beginning,
like this, a nice guy like you,

559
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:17,281
and you think: "That guy's going to die",

560
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:22,481
- and then it happens?
- No...

561
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,081
He always dies.

562
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:31,561
Arturo, believe me, you're that guy.

563
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:37,001
<i>Z24 to headquarters,
we'll be there in 30 seconds.</i>

564
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,001
30 seconds.

565
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:40,801
30 seconds.

566
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:44,961
<i>It's vital that the police</i>

567
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:47,681
don't have the faintest idea
about what we're doing.

568
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:51,721
We'll make them believe
we came in for a robbery,

569
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:55,521
they caught us by surprise leaving with
the money and everything was fucked up,

570
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:58,601
we took out the guns, shot point-blank
and we had no choice...

571
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:01,041
but to go back.

572
00:44:03,281 --> 00:44:06,081
<i>And then, not having hurt</i>

573
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:07,281
anybody,

574
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:11,281
we get inside.

575
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:16,281
<i>Let them think we're trapped like rats.</i>

576
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:19,361
<i>Let them think we're improvising.</i>

577
00:44:19,441 --> 00:44:20,281
Now!

578
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:23,921
Tokio! Tokio, wait, it's too soon!

579
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,081
Tokio!

580
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:32,321
<i>Go out, throw the money,
shot at the ground and go back.</i>

581
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:35,921
<i>I'd heard that more than 30 times.</i>

582
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,641
<i>But what the Profesor didn't tell us</i>

583
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:43,041
<i>is that they would
also shoot point-blank.</i>

584
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:45,201
Río, Río!

585
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:54,281
Holy shit, man!

586
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:41,561
Holy shit!

587
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:44,521
This couldn't have started
fucking worse, man!

588
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:05,641
Fuck!

589
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,321
<i>Urgent support. We need urgent support.</i>

590
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:11,161
<i>In the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.</i>

591
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:14,961
<i>We've got hostile gunfire. Officer down.
I repeat, officer down.</i>

592
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:18,961
<i>An M16 bullet is fired at 3510 kph.</i>

593
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:22,441
<i>It flies faster than the speed of sound.</i>

594
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,881
<i>So if you're shot in the heart,</i>

595
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:29,001
<i>you won't even hear
the bullet that has killed you.</i>

596
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:32,481
<i>That's how I knew I had fucked it all up,</i>

597
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:34,721
<i>in a millisecond,</i>

598
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,841
<i>in the same way i always do.</i>

599
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:45,801
Let's see...

600
00:46:46,761 --> 00:46:49,361
Paula, you need a purple flower there.

601
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:51,361
Paula.

602
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:53,121
Paula.

603
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:56,841
I don't understand
why dad can't come tomorrow

604
00:46:56,921 --> 00:47:00,321
- to my birthday party.
- I already told you, Paula.

605
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:02,881
A judge took custody away from him
and now it's me

606
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:05,041
- who will take care of you.
- It wasn't a judge.

607
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:06,441
- Really?
- No.

608
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:07,601
And who was that?

609
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:10,321
It was you. You don't want him
to come to my party.

610
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,081
Am I right, grandma?

611
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:16,161
Huh... Well, listen,
dad and mum are upset now.

612
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:19,521
- Things will get better, you'll see.
- Mum, please!

613
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:27,201
Inspector.

614
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:32,801
<i>Raquel, I know it's your day off,
but there's a robbery with hostages.</i>

615
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:36,441
<i>The robbers tried to go out
with the money, but they couldn't.</i>

616
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:38,001
<i>They've hurt two officers.</i>

617
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,961
<i>It's in the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre.</i>

618
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,921
<i>I want you to take care
of the negotiation.</i>

619
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:51,761
- Send me a car.
<i>- It's parked outside.</i>

620
00:47:56,361 --> 00:47:59,001
Explain me what the fucking shit was that!

621
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:01,881
Explain me what the fuck was that!
Are you crazy?

622
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,001
- You've riddled two policemen!
- Calm down.

623
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:07,121
A fucking officer appeared and shot at me.

624
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:09,001
What would you have done, spitting at him?

625
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:11,761
- Fucking shit!
- What can you do, man,

626
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:14,081
what can you do,
stick to the fucking plan, jeez,

627
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:16,321
we went over it 400 million times.

628
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:18,961
We said that,
we weren't going to shoot anyone.

629
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:22,321
- I fell, blocked by the impacts...
- Shut up!

630
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:25,241
We also covered you,
but shooting at the ground,

631
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:27,281
not point-blank to their bodies.

632
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:37,121
They're taking away the injured officers.

633
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:39,841
Are the phones connected?

634
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:44,761
Cut off any wireless or radio signal.

635
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:48,561
Let's pass to analogue.

636
00:48:58,641 --> 00:49:00,041
Call the Profesor.

637
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:09,601
What are you wearing?

638
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:12,961
What are you wearing?

639
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:16,321
What are you wearing?

640
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:25,001
- What happened?
<i>- Two officers were hurt.</i>

641
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:27,041
Who shot?

642
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:28,641
<i>Tokio.</i>

643
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,761
Connect the Profesor's cameras.

644
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:34,401
<i>A bullet went near Río and Tokio shot.</i>

645
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:37,881
It seems they have an affair.

646
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:41,241
Put her through.

647
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,641
<i>- What?</i>
- Is that true?

648
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:57,321
- So you have an affair with Río?
- What the fuck are you saying?

649
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,041
No.

650
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:01,481
The love of my life died because of me,

651
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:04,121
the last thing I would think about
is having an affair with a kid.

652
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:07,481
<i>I shot to protect myself and my partner.</i>

653
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:11,081
And, Mr. Profesor,
even if you think them over a lot, things

654
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,041
<i>don't always turn out</i>
the way you expect.

655
00:50:30,481 --> 00:50:32,401
- What happened?
- They opened a vault

656
00:50:32,481 --> 00:50:36,081
in the Fábrica de Moneda
to take the latest banknotes.

657
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:39,241
- Why didn't the alarms set off?
- There was a manual alarm,

658
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:41,961
- we guess it must have been a worker.
- How many hostages?

659
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:44,561
It's impossible to know,
the museum was open.

660
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:45,601
Give me a number.

661
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:50,521
Confirmed: 35 workers, 11 security guards
and 17 children from the British School.

662
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:53,081
- What the fuck were they doing there?
- It was a school visit.

663
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:55,761
- Do the media know about it yet?
- No, not yet.

664
00:50:56,441 --> 00:50:58,201
- The robbers?
- We don't know yet.

665
00:50:58,281 --> 00:51:01,001
We're getting images
from the nearby shops.

666
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:02,921
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- How many can they be?

667
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:06,401
Four went outside, we think six at least.

668
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:09,841
- Weapons?
- We know they have at least three M16.

669
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:12,721
- And they're extremely aggressive.
- The GEO are already here.

670
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:14,561
Yes, they came here in the first place.

671
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,681
Please, give me some good news.

672
00:51:19,801 --> 00:51:23,361
The officers who were shot are alive.

673
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:26,601
Thank goodness.

674
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:29,801
Let's go.

675
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:38,081
What's up with the cameras
inside the building?

676
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,921
- Where's the signal?
- There's no signal.

677
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:41,641
- Why not?
- There isn't, I don't know.

678
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:44,481
They must have broken or diverted it.
We're working on it.

679
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:45,801
What about the network?

680
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:48,641
They cut off the optical fibre,
we can't hack them.

681
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:54,081
Listen carefully, all of you,
Police, Civil Protection,

682
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:56,641
I want all the phones switched off.

683
00:51:56,841 --> 00:51:59,561
We're going to use the repeater
on the roof of the building

684
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:01,081
in case they make any calls.

685
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:03,241
I want any phone signal
in the whole perimeter

686
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,961
to get straight here.

687
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:08,481
Okay, I want
all the listening analysts here,

688
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:09,961
in two seconds. All right?

689
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:14,281
- Do we have the building layout?
- I'm considering a possible intervention.

690
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:23,001
Intense "volluto".

691
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:27,841
The public servants are
well taken care of.

692
00:52:28,801 --> 00:52:30,041
What the fuck are you doing?

693
00:52:31,241 --> 00:52:32,721
We have some free time.

694
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:37,041
They have to set up the camp,
send us a drone,

695
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:38,841
find the building layout.

696
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:41,441
We must give them some time
so they organize.

697
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:47,401
Hey, why did Tokio say
you're not together?

698
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:49,441
Because we're not.

699
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:54,641
Then why did I hear
every night her headboard

700
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:57,641
banging like a slide hammer?
Is she learning to dance samba

701
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:59,201
- at 5 in the morning?
- I don't know,

702
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:02,281
haven't got a fucking clue. Don't know
if she dances or she's restless.

703
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:09,641
Tell me, do I look like a sucker
to whom you can tell lies

704
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:11,601
as if you were spitting him on his face?

705
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:19,321
I'm kidding.

706
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:27,081
I would have fucked her, too.

707
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:29,921
In fact, I might try to.

708
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:32,561
I think you're wrong.

709
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:35,121
I'm very serious with her.

710
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:37,161
Very serious?

711
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:43,121
But, seriously as having a garden
and doing home improvement

712
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:45,161
- on Sundays?
- That's right.

713
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,961
And fill it with children.

714
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:55,081
Sit down.

715
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:06,961
Look, boy, women will give you sex and fun

716
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:11,441
because... they're programmed
to subdue so you impregnate them.

717
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:13,841
Later you'll cease to exist.

718
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:16,761
During childbirth you'll notice that.

719
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,921
Childbirth must be the most exciting event
in a father's life.

720
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:24,841
In childbirth, whatever comes out
from between her legs

721
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:27,641
is a nuclear warhead
that will destroy everything.

722
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:32,041
First of all, the wonderful cave
where you used to put your thingy

723
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:33,361
will never be the same again.

724
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:36,881
And while she's cursing you
and asks for the epidural,

725
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,521
she'll have a bowel movement.

726
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:43,201
Do you know what she means by that?

727
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,401
That she'll never be a sexy woman again.

728
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:50,241
And that from now on
that sucker is becoming

729
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:52,641
the centre of the universe.

730
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:55,001
They're all the same.

731
00:54:57,401 --> 00:55:01,001
Believe me, I've had five divorces.
Do you know what five divorces are?

732
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:05,641
Five times I believed in love.

733
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:11,881
What fucking shit
have you got in your head?

734
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:15,481
Huh?

735
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:18,601
How the hell could Profesor
put you in charge?

736
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:23,721
Due to my sensitivity dealing with people.

737
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:33,001
Take the little lamb out of the group
and take her to an office.

738
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:34,201
And don't leave her alone.

739
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:36,361
If she needs to change her towel,
stand next to her.

740
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:38,481
Okay.

741
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:53,601
Let's go.

742
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:58,721
Don't worry. I'm taking you elsewhere
so you can rest, that's all.

743
00:55:58,801 --> 00:55:59,681
Okay?

744
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:09,161
Raquel, all the communications
we keep from the inside

745
00:56:09,321 --> 00:56:12,561
must be done from this phone
or the radio, not cell phones, okay?

746
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:16,081
Put me through with the interior,
I want to talk to the robbers.

747
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:20,241
Ángel, what the fuck
is colonel Prieto doing here?

748
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,481
I don't know. I don't know.

749
00:56:25,321 --> 00:56:28,801
There are people shooting their guns
in the place where money is made.

750
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:32,241
Don't you think Intelligence
should be aware?

751
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:35,001
Calling the Fábrica
de Moneda y Timbre, Raquel.

752
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,881
Boss, call to the interior in progress.

753
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:05,601
<i>Hello.</i>

754
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,961
- Good afternoon.
<i>- I'm Raquel Murillo,</i>

755
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:10,921
the inspector in charge of the robbery.
Who am I talking to?

756
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:13,441
<i>To the robber in charge of the assault.</i>

757
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:16,401
- He's got a voice changer.
- Cleaning the signal.

758
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,481
How are your mates doing?

759
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:23,921
So far we haven't had any casualties.

760
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:25,721
<i>I'm glad.</i>

761
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:29,601
<i>Really, sincerely.</i>

762
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:35,521
Excuse me, I can't hear you well.

763
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:38,481
Yes, I'm sorry about
this hateful metallic voice,

764
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:42,201
<i>but you must understand
I have to protect my identity,</i>

765
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:45,081
just in case one day you give us
a helicopter and we go to Brazil.

766
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:47,761
Is that what you want, a helicopter?

767
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:50,041
<i>What I want right now
is to negotiate with someone"</i>

768
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:53,401
who doesn't give us the runaround,
who doesn't need to ask a superior,

769
00:57:53,481 --> 00:57:56,601
Intelligence or their mum
to give me a yes or a no.

770
00:57:57,001 --> 00:58:01,481
Then you should talk to the president,
but since he's busy running the country,

771
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,881
I'll try to stand in for him,

772
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:04,361
<i>if you don't mind.</i>

773
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,921
- Any further questions?
<i>- Yes.</i>

774
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,361
What are you wearing?

775
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:18,641
- Pardon?
<i>- What are you wearing?</i>

776
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:21,121
<i>Don't you think our clothes</i>

777
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:22,961
say a lot about our personality?

778
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:28,681
Look, I have no objection
to answer your question,

779
00:58:28,761 --> 00:58:30,721
but I think I should inform you

780
00:58:30,801 --> 00:58:33,681
<i>this conversation is being heard
by several members</i>

781
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,561
<i>of the UDEF, the UIT, the CNI</i>

782
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,801
and their liaison office, the chief
of the GEO and some other officers.

783
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:44,401
In that case, I think I should say hello
and introduce myself.

784
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:46,521
It's nice to meet you.

785
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:49,241
<i>I regret I can't tell you my name,
but you can call me</i>

786
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:52,401
Profesor, everybody calls me so.

787
00:58:57,441 --> 00:59:00,241
Hello. I'm Ángel,
Deputy Inspector of Police.

788
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:02,401
Nice to meet you, Ángel.
How are you doing?

789
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:05,801
<i>- Hello, good morning.</i>
- Good morning.

790
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:07,281
Hello, how are you?

791
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:10,321
Very well. I'm very well,
thanks a lot. And you?

792
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:15,881
After this emotional moment, tell me,

793
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,361
- what do you want?
- Time...

794
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:22,961
<i>to try and clarify things.</i>

795
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:24,561
<i>Listen to me, Inspector.</i>

796
00:59:24,721 --> 00:59:27,201
<i>We couldn't go out only for
a matter of seconds, but we're</i>

797
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:29,681
perfectly ready to defend ourselves,

798
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:32,481
<i>so try to avoid
any kind of intervention.</i>

799
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,761
- Can I trust you?
- Of course.

800
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:43,001
But in order for me to trust you,
you must make a gesture towards me.

801
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:46,561
Release those children from the school,
they're minors.

802
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:48,321
Everything will be much better that way.

803
00:59:49,441 --> 00:59:52,561
But, Inspector, you still
haven't told me what you're wearing.

804
00:59:56,241 --> 01:00:00,201
A grey suit jacket, a blue shirt,

805
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:03,241
<i>black high heel boots and...</i>

806
01:00:03,721 --> 01:00:06,321
Well, I think so far that's enough, right?

807
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:08,761
<i>So I can picture you a lot better.</i>

808
01:00:08,921 --> 01:00:13,281
But, Inspector, a suit jacket for women
can have a skirt or trousers,

809
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:16,161
<i>so I'll ask you that next time you are</i>

810
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,241
a bit more specific.

811
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:22,641
Let me think about your request.

812
01:00:27,121 --> 01:00:29,241
Tell me, what sort of lunatic
with 60 hostages

813
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,121
thinks about teasing his negotiator?

814
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:38,321
No, he's too calm to be a lunatic.

815
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:42,521
I want helicopters flying
all day long over their heads!

816
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:45,801
No food, water or any other type
of request. Am I clear?

817
01:00:45,961 --> 01:00:47,441
Excuse me, Inspector.

818
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:51,281
Just because you leave them without
dessert I don't think they'll surrender.

819
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,641
Both the chief of the GEO,
here present, and me

820
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:57,521
believe it's necessary
an immediate intervention.

821
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:01,521
If they wanted a massacre
like in Moscú's Opera House,

822
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:03,561
they'd have called you straightaway,

823
01:01:04,201 --> 01:01:07,161
but unfortunately
you're here only to opine and bug.

824
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:10,641
Please, Inspector,
don't be on the defensive.

825
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,121
I'm here to help you.

826
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:14,521
I know you're not going
through your best moment.

827
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:18,721
If you mean my period, it's not the case,
but thanks for asking.

828
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:23,241
I mean the complaint of ill-treatment
you've filed against your ex-husband.

829
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:33,481
Wow, I see Intelligence
did their homework.

830
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:37,161
There isn't a single room
where they don't stick their nose, right?

831
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:39,041
Internal Affairs also do it.

832
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:42,481
They think you've brought a false report.

833
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,601
Your ex-husband has rebuilt his life

834
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:48,201
both personally and professionally
in the police,

835
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:51,521
but some women don't always turn the page.

836
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:55,561
Look, I don't know if you're miserable

837
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:58,321
or... just stupid.

838
01:02:00,241 --> 01:02:02,641
If somebody's interested
in my personal life,

839
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:05,601
I must say
that matter has been totally got past

840
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:07,161
and it's in the hands of a judge.

841
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:14,121
Thanks for your sensitivity, colonel.

842
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:21,801
There's an incoming call
in the museum's repeater.

843
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:23,961
- Record it.
- Yes, we're recording.

844
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,761
Turn up the volume. Silence, please!

845
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:30,121
<i>- Why aren't you coming for dinner?
- I'm working.</i>

846
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:32,641
<i>My apologies to your mother and sister.</i>

847
01:02:32,721 --> 01:02:33,881
<i>Why aren't you coming?</i>

848
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:37,441
There's a good mess here.
My apologies to them. Believe me.

849
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:39,961
- Don't yell at me, honey, please.
- Almansa!

850
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:41,841
I have to go, okay, sweetheart?

851
01:02:41,921 --> 01:02:44,441
Okay, I love you so much. Bye.

852
01:02:46,761 --> 01:02:47,721
Cut.

853
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:49,921
It's Almansa.

854
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:22,521
Why did you bring me here?

855
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:29,921
No, don't worry.

856
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:32,321
They brought me here to protect you.

857
01:03:34,161 --> 01:03:35,041
Just that.

858
01:03:35,921 --> 01:03:38,121
When you get naked, please,
put on the red overalls.

859
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:39,961
Fine.

860
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:11,521
Stand up.

861
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:14,801
Come on, come on.

862
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:20,361
Take out your masks.

863
01:04:22,161 --> 01:04:23,801
Take out your masks!

864
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:25,121
What's the matter?

865
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,121
We're going to be good.

866
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:32,001
Something has come up,

867
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:34,681
but, in spite of helicopters,

868
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:37,201
I'm aware we're going
to have some quiet hours

869
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,321
and you'll be able to rest.

870
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:42,801
In a few minutes
we'll give you sleeping bags,

871
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:47,161
water and a sandwich.
Oh, and let me ask you a favour.

872
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:50,041
I want you to get naked.

873
01:04:52,281 --> 01:04:54,841
I want to give you red overalls like ours

874
01:04:55,161 --> 01:04:56,761
so you feel more comfortable.

875
01:04:57,321 --> 01:04:59,761
Excuse me, sir,
I don't want to bother you.

876
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:04,041
Among these people there are people
with heart conditions,

877
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:07,681
pregnant women, diabetics, teenagers...

878
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:12,321
I beg you, please,
release those who are more vulnerable.

879
01:05:12,401 --> 01:05:14,961
I don't think they can stand
this anguish all night long.

880
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:18,441
- Do you think you're fucking Gandhi?
- Denver, calm down.

881
01:05:18,601 --> 01:05:22,521
He's a friend of mine.
We share our love for cinema.

882
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:33,921
Take the gun.

883
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:37,081
I'm not asking you if you want,

884
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:40,721
I'm telling you to take the gun.
Take the gun. Take the gun.

885
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,881
- And now aim at me.
- No, please.

886
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:47,481
I'm telling you to aim at me.

887
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:50,721
A fucking order. Aim at me, jeez.

888
01:05:50,881 --> 01:05:52,241
- Here. Fine.
- No, please.

889
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:54,441
And now you shoot me.

890
01:05:54,601 --> 01:05:55,881
- Pardon?
- Shoot me.

891
01:05:57,001 --> 01:05:58,201
- Shoot me.
- Please.

892
01:05:58,761 --> 01:06:01,041
- Please, no!
- Either you shoot me

893
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:03,041
or I'll shoot you. I give you ten seconds.

894
01:06:03,121 --> 01:06:06,321
One, two, three, four, five,

895
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:08,681
six, seven, eight, nine...

896
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:17,361
They're fake, Arturito,
but you did very well.

897
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:20,681
You did very well.
It's a present, you can keep it.

898
01:06:20,761 --> 01:06:23,521
Now we're giving you some fake guns.

899
01:06:23,721 --> 01:06:26,041
In a few hours
we'll need your cooperation.

900
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:29,841
As you've seen, the only thing
you have to do is obey.

901
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,161
Trust us... and obey.

902
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:38,881
Come on, get naked.

903
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:41,121
Come on.

904
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:52,361
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

905
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:55,801
Raquel, no walkie-talkie, no phones,
no electronic devices.

906
01:06:55,881 --> 01:06:58,321
We haven't located
any radiofrequency inside.

907
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:01,681
Are you telling me they communicate
using an empty yogurt and a string

908
01:07:01,761 --> 01:07:04,041
- so we don't detect them?
- I don't know if it's a yogurt

909
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:06,761
or it's a gang of deaf-mutes,
but we can't find any frequencies.

910
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:04,161
What the fuck are
those armoured vehicles doing here?

911
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:09,721
We're getting in with everything.

912
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:14,921
That'll be if I give the order.
I'm in charge but I still haven't done it.

913
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,481
They're orders from above.

914
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,081
Is anyone going to tell me
what the fuck is going on here

915
01:08:24,161 --> 01:08:26,481
or do I have to phone
the Minister of Interior Affairs?

916
01:08:29,561 --> 01:08:31,641
- What the fuck is going on?
- Let's go.

917
01:08:41,321 --> 01:08:43,201
Inside there's a priority 1 person.

918
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:45,681
- Do you know what "priority 1" is?
- No.

919
01:08:45,761 --> 01:08:49,241
I'm not with your Intelligence gang,
I don't know.

920
01:08:49,481 --> 01:08:53,081
They'll get in. They'll get in
because we have our little lamb.

921
01:08:55,521 --> 01:08:56,841
Alison Parker.

922
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:59,921
<i>Sir Benjamin Parker's daughter.
he's the UK ambassador"</i>

923
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:02,281
and a close friend
to the Queen of England.

924
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:04,481
That's why we have no choice
but getting in,

925
01:09:04,561 --> 01:09:07,801
because, if we don't do it now,
the whole country will know tomorrow.

926
01:09:08,761 --> 01:09:12,761
They'll think we don't know.
They'll think they managed to hide

927
01:09:12,841 --> 01:09:15,361
all that information
from the public opinion.

928
01:09:15,561 --> 01:09:19,321
Today she's just another hostage,
but tomorrow she'll be the main bullseye

929
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:21,841
and all the guns will aim at her head.

930
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:24,041
Is that what you want? Huh?

931
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:29,881
That's why they'll get in the first night.
And they'll do it before 04:15 am.

932
01:09:30,841 --> 01:09:33,481
Because at 6:30 begins to get light.

933
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:36,681
Do you imagine what it'd be
for Spain a hostage crisis

934
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:38,521
managed by the United Kingdom?

935
01:09:39,521 --> 01:09:41,961
And it's better
if they don't hesitate to get in

936
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:46,201
because then we'll have more possibilities
to win the first battle.

937
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:55,281
Inspector Murillo,

938
01:09:55,361 --> 01:09:58,881
we're getting in now
and we're taking out that girl alive.

939
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:23,401
I have to talk to you...
You've ignored me all the time.

940
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:25,721
Shut up, they'll kill us all
and it's your fault.

941
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:28,521
Sorry.

942
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:47,001
It seems you don't like
your boss much, right?

943
01:10:49,401 --> 01:10:50,801
How do you know he's my boss?

944
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:56,121
Because I know everything about you.

945
01:10:56,881 --> 01:10:57,881
I've studied that.

946
01:11:00,161 --> 01:11:02,281
I've also seen the pregnancy test
on your table.

947
01:11:05,081 --> 01:11:07,121
And now I guess who the father must be.

948
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:11,921
He didn't like the present.

949
01:11:15,281 --> 01:11:16,241
What did he say?

950
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,401
He doesn't want to deal with it?

951
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:27,481
It's not easy saying goodbye to a baby.

952
01:11:36,401 --> 01:11:37,641
What are you going to do?

953
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:44,001
Abort.

954
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:04,761
Intervention units 1, 2 and 3, ready.

955
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:07,481
- We're getting in.
- Let's go!

956
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:10,201
- Come on, come on!
<i>- Teams 1, 2 and 3, ready.</i>

957
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:13,241
Now.

958
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:29,041
Team 1, hidden at the front door.

959
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:31,041
Watch the flat roof and the high flanks.

960
01:12:40,881 --> 01:12:41,801
Hello?

961
01:12:42,161 --> 01:12:43,121
Berlín,

962
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,481
- they're getting in.
- There we go.

963
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:51,521
People, the time has come!

964
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:54,241
It's the moment to follow my orders!

965
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:03,361
Follow us.

966
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:14,441
<i>And that's how the State security forces</i>

967
01:13:14,521 --> 01:13:17,681
<i>did exactly what the Profesor
told us they'd do,</i>

968
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:19,841
<i>only that afternoon, when he said that,</i>

969
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:22,601
<i>we were in the countryside
and we didn't have the feeling</i>

970
01:13:22,761 --> 01:13:24,601
<i>they were going to shoot us in the head.</i>

971
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:27,761
They'll get in through the four places
they can use to access:

972
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:31,361
the main door, the load area,
the emergency exit and the rooftop.

973
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:33,761
Watch the rearguard
of the overtaken doors.

974
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:34,841
Don't let anyone out.

975
01:13:36,081 --> 01:13:40,921
But they'll wait. They'll wait
for Technical Intervention officers

976
01:13:41,081 --> 01:13:42,841
to examine the place.

977
01:13:43,641 --> 01:13:45,441
They'll do that from the load access.

978
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:03,881
Come on, come on.

979
01:14:08,441 --> 01:14:10,001
Come on, they're already at the door.

980
01:14:22,201 --> 01:14:23,161
Okay?

981
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:26,201
Insert the periscope.

982
01:14:28,201 --> 01:14:29,281
Let's go.

983
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:41,081
Raquel, there's an incoming call
from one hostage's phone,

984
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:42,201
Alison Parker.

985
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:44,841
<i>As you know, a group of kidnappers...</i>

986
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:45,881
Turn it up.

987
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:49,481
<i>We have another listener
on the phone to give us her opinion.</i>

988
01:14:49,561 --> 01:14:52,561
<i>I'm not a listener.
I'm a hostage and I'm kidnapped.</i>

989
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,881
My name's Alison Parker. I'm the United
Kingdom's ambassador's daughter.

990
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:57,681
- Live, in Onda Cero.
<i>- I'm calling you</i>

991
01:14:57,761 --> 01:14:59,921
from the interior
of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

992
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,801
End that call right now!

993
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:04,681
- Now! End it now!
- End the call!

994
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:06,921
We're dressed just like the kidnappers.

995
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:08,601
Colonel, we have images.

996
01:15:12,361 --> 01:15:13,601
What the fuck is that?

997
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,121
They gave us guns
and we're wearing the same masks.

998
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:23,721
- Enlarge. Stop there.
- Nobody knows who is who.

999
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:27,361
- He's got a Browning machine gun.
- Motherfuckers.

1000
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:29,881
If the police come in,
innocents will get hurt.

1001
01:15:29,961 --> 01:15:32,481
Entrenched with the hostages,
all with the same clothes.

1002
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,761
It's impossible to know
who they're going to shoot.

1003
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:37,881
- Don't get in.
- Stop this, Suárez.

1004
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:39,561
Stop it!

1005
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:45,401
- Don't get in, for God's sake.
- Stop it.

1006
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:51,441
Abandon positions. Abort the operation.

1007
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:10,801
Inspector...

1008
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:14,521
Finish what you started, colonel.

1009
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:19,521
I don't want to have
anything to do with this.

1010
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:35,321
<i>And that's how we won our first battle
the first night there,</i>

1011
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:38,321
<i>without entering a combat
and thanks to common sense.</i>

1012
01:16:39,921 --> 01:16:41,321
<i>And 20 minutes later...</i>

1013
01:16:42,361 --> 01:16:44,561
<i>we started to do what we were there for.</i>

1014
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:49,841
This is the nicest part,
we're going to work.

1015
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:51,481
With me:

1016
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:56,041
Torres, Sánchez, Biedma,

1017
01:16:56,841 --> 01:16:57,721
<i>Lennon,</i>

1018
01:16:58,401 --> 01:16:59,401
<i>Guatsani,</i>

1019
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,201
<i>Molina, García,</i>

1020
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:06,161
<i>Domingo, De Gorza, Mateo.</i>

1021
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:07,441
Come on, that way.

1022
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:09,961
<i>Rodrigo, Molla, Pérez.</i>

1023
01:17:10,721 --> 01:17:11,601
Come on.

1024
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:18,881
Listen, I want the machines working

1025
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:22,481
24 hours a day,
as if it was one of Pocholo's raves.

1026
01:17:22,561 --> 01:17:23,481
You know what I mean?

1027
01:17:25,481 --> 01:17:29,201
<i>Every time we stop we'll lose a million,
so we're not stopping.</i>

1028
01:17:29,801 --> 01:17:32,481
We'll do the technical amendments
every three hours,

1029
01:17:32,641 --> 01:17:34,081
<i>both from the ink and the offset.</i>

1030
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:39,401
So you know: joy, party and excitement.

1031
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:45,201
<i>The best paid job ever:</i>

1032
01:17:45,281 --> 01:17:48,401
<i>2400 million euros, maybe more.</i>

1033
01:17:48,481 --> 01:17:51,201
<i>It all depended on the time
we could hold on inside.</i>

1034
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:54,681
Oh my goodness! This is wonderful, man!

1035
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:59,721
This is wonderful, "coquinoqui"!

1036
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:02,001
Our money, man!

1037
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:03,921
Jeez!

1038
01:18:08,521 --> 01:18:11,721
We're making our own dough, people!

1039
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:27,081
Can I have a decaf, please?

1040
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:35,321
<i>Hello. This is Mariví's
answering machine.</i>

1041
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:37,561
<i>When you hear the beep,
you can leave a message.</i>

1042
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:40,321
Mum, I've just finished, it's six...

1043
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:48,961
- Excuse me, do you have a phone charger?
- No.

1044
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:56,001
Do you want to use mine?

1045
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:01,161
Really? Don't you mind?

1046
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,041
- No.
- Are you sure?

1047
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:05,521
Thanks.

1048
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:08,281
I have to make a couple of calls.

1049
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:11,201
- It's all right.
- Thank you very much.

1050
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:21,161
NEXT EPISODE

1051
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:22,521
What the hell are we going to do
with so much dough?

1052
01:19:22,601 --> 01:19:25,201
If we are going to steal big,
dream big.

1053
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:27,841
I would record an album.
Of corridos.

1054
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:30,841
This way. On the cover all my face.

1055
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:32,921
You are not the captain
of the rugby team?

1056
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:34,841
- No. Athletics.
- Then... run.

1057
01:19:36,881 --> 01:19:37,921
Fuck.

1058
01:19:42,161 --> 01:19:43,281
Think about what you say,

1059
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:45,601
because I have
a damn polygraph here.

1060
01:19:48,361 --> 01:19:50,441
<i>Everyone attentive to my order.</i>

1061
01:19:50,761 --> 01:19:52,201
She is a hostage.

1062
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:08,481
It has 67 mobile phones attached
with Velcro on the wall.

1063
01:20:08,601 --> 01:20:09,961
<i>Listen, inspec...</i>

1064
01:20:40,521 --> 01:20:42,241
Did you see the coke?
