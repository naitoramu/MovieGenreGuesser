1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:03,423
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:03,523 --> 00:00:05,907
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:08,793
survive.

4
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:10,628
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,030
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:15,199
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,836
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:21,172
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:24,843
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:27,842
Previously on "Arrow"...
Mom?

11
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:29,427
It's about Sarah.
What about her?

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,378
I think
she may be alive.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,182
I'm not here to hurt you
or your father.

14
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:37,051
Why should I trust you?!

15
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:39,053
Because you always have.

16
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,155
This is my daughter, Helena.

17
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:42,857
When her father
killed her fiancé,

18
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,942
she changed into something
dark and twisted.

19
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,063
I have been alone
in my hate for so long.

20
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,283
What is this?
Payback.

21
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:55,119
The police
have him in custody.

22
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,338
He's going to jail
and then onto prison.

23
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,906
I'm not going to stop.

24
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:23,531
Hey, mister.

25
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,117
You feel like a dance?

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,873
Absolutely.

27
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:35,710
Tonight
your first night?

28
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:38,279
First, and last.

29
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,331
Gus.

30
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,800
Helena!

31
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,502
I'm looking for my father.

32
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,488
I figure if anybody knows
where he is,

33
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,674
it'd be his attorney.

34
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,309
I don't.

35
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:56,814
Ohh! Helena,
I swear...

36
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,051
I'd tell you where
the FBI's keeping Frank,

37
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,154
but after your father and I
made his plea deal to testify,

38
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,140
the Feds, they stopped
telling me anything.

39
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:07,859
Please.

40
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,978
You have to believe me.

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,830
I do.

42
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:25,826
Hey, Gus, song's over,
man. You still in there?

43
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,916

It looks amazing!

47
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,823
Yeah.

48
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:58,192
Steve Aoki's going to deejay.
Right there.

49
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,027
What? How did you get
Steve Aoki?

50
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,362
I dated his sister.

51
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:02,580
Oh.

52
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,582
A million years ago,
a million years ago.

53
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,917
Ok.

54
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,387
So, will you be my date
tomorrow night?

55
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,539
Is a club opening
a proper date?

56
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,091
I certainly hope so.

57
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,061
Is that a "yes?"

58
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,479
No.

59
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,802
That's a "yes."

60
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,892
Laurel.

61
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:33,778
I'm glad you called.

62
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,497
Too much...
It's too long

63
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:38,282
for us to go
without talking.

64
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:41,786
Dad, I have
to tell you--

65
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,588
No, no, listen,
before you say anything,

66
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,839
I got to apologize.

67
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,791
I should never have used you

68
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,710
to catch the archer,
and I'm sorry.

69
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,912
Laurel, I'm just--
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:53,197
Thank you.

71
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,600
I owe you
an apology, too.

72
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,468
For what?

73
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,520
Hello, Quentin.

74
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,307
How are you?

75
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,925
You look well.

76
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,128
What are you doing here?

77
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,647
Why--why are you here?

78
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:13,801
I'm here because I believe
Sarah's still alive.

79
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,570
What?!

80
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,939
Dad. Sit--
What is going on?

81
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,942
Just hear mom out.
Sit.

82
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,494
What's going on?

83
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,162
Start from
the beginning.

84
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:30,284
Oliver was found
on an island

85
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,304
called Lian Yu
in the North China Sea.

86
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,998
There are hundreds;

87
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:37,426
Thousands of deserted
islands in this chain.

88
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:41,379
What if Sarah
had survived, too?

89
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,981
And nobody would know if she'd
washed up in any one of those.

90
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,234
So you don't actually
have any proof that she's alive?

91
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:49,303
I have proof.

92
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,524
A tourist took this.

93
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,645
Could be anybody.

94
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:00,531
Doesn't it look
just like Sarah?

95
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:04,752
Our daughter's
a survivor, Quentin.

96
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:07,955
Ah, you have some nerve.

97
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,824
Three years, no phone calls,
no emails, nothing.

98
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:11,959
You just show up
with an old photo--

99
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,844
Dad, please.
No.

100
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,515
Please, you listen to me, ok?
Sarah died on that boat.

101
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,387
Why--

102
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:27,942
why are you making me
re-live this?

103
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,561
I'm not doing this.

104
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,699
Dad...

105
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,867
No.

106
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,487
So I told Chris and Shane they could be
our plus ones tonight

107
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,873
to Oliver's club--
if they're lucky.

108
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,076
We both have plus ones, right?

109
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,712
Uh, I-I don't know.

110
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,864
Hang on just a second.

111
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:54,635
I didn't know purse snatchers
took coffee breaks.

112
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,387
You know, for a stuck up,
rich bitch,

113
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,205
you seem to spend
a lot of time here in the Glades.

114
00:05:58,207 --> 00:05:59,840
My job's around here.

115
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:02,042
You? Have a job?
Yeah.

116
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,710
You know, you should
try it some time.

117
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:05,229
Instead of hanging out
on a street corner,

118
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,764
waiting to boost
somebody's handbag.

119
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,182
Sounds good.

120
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:09,734
Know anyone who's hiring
high school dropouts

121
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,769
with a couple of priors,
no references

122
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,070
and a history
of violence?

123
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,424
Actually, I might.

124
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:19,093
You know that new club
opening in the Glades?

125
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:22,079
Verdant? My brother owns it.

126
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,416
I think he might be hiring
valet attendants.

127
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,034
Do you think
it's a good idea?

128
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,120
Me, taking the keys
to stranger's cars?

129
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,655
I think it's time
you put up or shut up.

130
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,575
Talk to your brother.

131
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:47,855
Yo.

132
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:50,608
Hey.

133
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,726
Where you been?

134
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,995
Oh, I thought I'd give myself
a rare morning in.

135
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,482
Don't look at me like that.
The club is opening, finally.

136
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,267
McKenna and I are going
on date number six tonight,

137
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:03,604
which is...
It's significant.

138
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:05,322
And, uh, I don't know.

139
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,108
It seemed like a good day
to give the bad guys a rest.

140
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:14,131
Well, it's the bad girls
that I'm worried about.

141
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,484
Helena.

142
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:17,768
Yes, or as I like
to call her,

143
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,019
your psycho
ex-girlfriend.

144
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,271
This was taken
at Alley Cats,

145
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,339
the strip joint.
The police report

146
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,059
lists the stiff's name
as Gus Sabatoni.

147
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,677
That's Bertinelli's lawyer.

148
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,579
Why would she come back
to Starling City just for him?

149
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,498
It's not like he did
a good job.

150
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,600
Her father's serving consecutive life
sentences without parole.

151
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,352
Come on, Oliver, we both knew
this was just a matter of time.

152
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,822
You tried to help her,
you couldn't.

153
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,103
Now the only question is,

154
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,979
how long before she drops
the dime on you,

155
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,644
me, this whole operation.

156
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,831
Look, I want you to get in touch
with her contacts in the Bratva.

157
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,316
Talk to anyone on the street,
figure out where Helena is,

158
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,817
why she's back.

159
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,486
Ok. But Oliver--

160
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,987
dig, if she's here,
she's here for a reason.

161
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,372
If that's not Frank Bertinelli,

162
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,924
we need to know
what she has planned.

163
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,009
Ok.

164
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:10,054
- Speedy?
- Oh, we're in here.

165
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,107
Look who's back.

166
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,359
She was just telling me about
your guys' first date--

167
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,510
at Russo's.

168
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,445
Hello, Oliver.

169
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:21,482
Oh, Ollie, I kind of have
this pseudo friend

170
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,033
that's looking
for a job.

171
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,236
I was wondering
if the club's still hiring?

172
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,371
Yes. Of course.
Talk to Tommy.

173
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,207
As a matter of fact, you can go
upstairs and call Tommy, right now.

174
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,042
Great.

175
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,078
You rock.

176
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,867
Where you been?

177
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:43,220
Um...

178
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,390
Barcelona.

179
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,226
Monaco, Budapest.

180
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,595
I just needed
to forget who I was.

181
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,213
And how much
I missed you.

182
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:56,016
Do you mean like
you missed Gus Sabatoni?

183
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,711
I thought you were done

184
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:59,816
with your father's
organization, Helena.

185
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:02,606
Because he's serving
consecutive life sentences

186
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,892
in Iron Heights prison.

187
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,493
You got your revenge.

188
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:07,912
He just cut a deal

189
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,747
with the Justice
Department to testify

190
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,448
against
the East Coast family.

191
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,584
In 48 hours,
Witness Protection

192
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,669
will give him a new name,
a new life,

193
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,955
and he'll be off the grid forever--
untraceable!

194
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

195
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:23,077
My father doesn't
deserve a second chance--

196
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,379
a second life.
And I can't.

197
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,116
I can't take on
a phalanx of U.S. marshals.

198
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:32,303
Not without help.

199
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,505
No.

200
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,307
It's murder.

201
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,409
It's not justice.

202
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,594
Oh, there you are.

203
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:43,364
I have a question about
your opening tonight.

204
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,782
Hello.

205
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,984
Hi.

206
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,486
Oliver, who's
your friend?

207
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,439
Oh! Mom, this is Helena.
Helena, this is my mother.

208
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,626
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Helena was just leaving.

209
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,111
Yes. I have
a family engagement.

210
00:09:58,113 --> 00:09:59,997
Excuse us for a minute.

211
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,466
Of course.

212
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:07,471
I guess I will just have
to be more persuasive.

213
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,306
Fortunately...

214
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,393
You have a family, too.

215
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,382
She was in my house.

216
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:31,218
She made a not so veiled threat.

217
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,720
I want extra security
around my mother and sister.

218
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:35,806
Way ahead of you, man.
Thank you.

219
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:36,873
It's my job.

220
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,210
For not saying,
"I told you so."

221
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:41,711
Night's young.

222
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,767
Where you been?

223
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:49,686
The club opens in four hours.

224
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:50,921
I've been dealing
with the vendors.

225
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:54,390
No, you haven't. Tommy...

226
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,993
We need to talk.

227
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:01,898
I'm sorry, all right.

228
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,118
But I kept this
a secret to protect

229
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,870
the people that are
closest to me.

230
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:09,105
Do you think that's
what I care about?

231
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:12,959
What, that my
feelings are hurt?

232
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,629
You're a murderer.

233
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:18,081
A killer.

234
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,416
You were my best
friend in life,

235
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,752
but now it's like
I don't even know you.

236
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:25,605
You're right.
I've changed.

237
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:28,558
Listen, buddy,
now I can explain to you.

238
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,027
I can explain
to you how and why--

239
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,563
What'd be the point?

240
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:36,316
I wouldn't believe
a word of it, anyway.

241
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:48,161
One of those missiles
has an effective range

242
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,964
of up to 2,400 kilometers.

243
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:52,368
We're not going anywhere

244
00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:54,385
until we figure out
what Fyers is planning.

245
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:00,290
Wild guess? He's planning
on blowing something up.

246
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,676
Well, one of those
could do the job.

247
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,294
But this?

248
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:06,813
This is about
starting a war.

249
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:09,465
With who?

250
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,567
What does it matter?

251
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:13,987
We have to stop Fyers

252
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:16,639
before he kills thousands of
innocent people.

253
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:18,174
There are tons
of soldiers down there.

254
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,277
Even if we get through
all of them,

255
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,913
we can't just steal
a whole missile launcher.

256
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,820
Well, who said anything
about stealing it?

257
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,208
So what's the plan?

258
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,294
Ambush?
It's impossible.

259
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:40,130
We can't take out all six without
one radioing for back up.

260
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:43,383
It'd be good if we could
get all the soldiers in one place.

261
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:49,773
You're right.

262
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:02,052
What'd the stapler
ever do to you?

263
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:05,038
What is it, Laurel? I'm busy.
The Hood's girlfriend is back.

264
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,875
Dad, I'm sorry
about this morning.

265
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:11,995
But if I told you the real reason
to come see me,

266
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,797
you wouldn't
have shown up.

267
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,199
You're damn right I wouldn't.

268
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:20,587
So you really believe this
garbage your mother's selling

269
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,472
about Sarah being alive
on fantasy island?

270
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:26,593
I mean, no.

271
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,213
But what would it
hurt to take a look

272
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:32,432
at everything
that mom found?

273
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,367
Even if it's just
to set her straight.

274
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:37,187
Laurel, you know how long
it's taken for me to get

275
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:38,594
to a place where Sarah
isn't the first thing

276
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,608
I think about every morning?

277
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:43,743
Dad...

278
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:52,235
Tell your mom
I'm not making any promises.

279

♪ Die

To Verdant.

282
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:24,851
I know I haven't always
been supportive of this venture,

283
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:27,070
but I have to admit

284
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:30,040
this nightclub
is quite an accomplishment.

285
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,275
I'm proud of you.

286
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:33,943
Your father would be, too.

287
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:36,996
Yeah, congratulations,

288
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:39,299
Ollie. The club
doesn't totally suck.

289
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:41,134
Thanks, Speedy.
Thank you very much,

290
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,969

297

Is everything ok?

298
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:05,525
I'm great.

299
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,944
Well, breakfast was a disaster.

300
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:11,281
Breakfast?
With my parents?

301
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:14,167
Right. That was
this morning.

302
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:15,752
Uh...

303
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,487
Sorry.

304
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,155
Are you sure
everything's ok?

305
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:21,824
Because you seem
completely off.

306
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:24,494
I'm fine.
I promise.

307
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:26,179
Tommy! Tommy.

308
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,998
Did you call Roy yet?
I left him a message.

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,718
He starts tomorrow.
Which reminds me,

310
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,771
I have to go check in
with the office.

311
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,672
Excuse me.

312
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,341
Hey, Tommy.

313
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:40,693
Remember me?

314
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,587
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Queen.

315
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:10,306
Your timing is perfect.
I can't dance.

316
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,058
They said it was urgent.

317
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:15,812
You ok?

318
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,764
Yeah. We ran out of Cristal.

319
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,232
Oh.
I'll be right back.

320
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,100
Ok.

321
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,722
Dig?

322
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,958
Let him go.

323
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,726
He has nothing
to do with this.

324
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,496
I told you.

325
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:35,582
Oliver, I warned you.

326
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:38,084
Helena! This isn't you.

327
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:41,037
My father is a mobster
and a murderer.

328
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,199
It is not like you haven't
killed men like that before!

329
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,455
And I tried to teach you

330
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,010
to obtain your objective
without killing!

331
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,246
By applying leverage.

332
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:53,933
By exploiting
someone's weakness.

333
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:00,390
There is a whole club
full of leverage

334
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:02,592
above our heads
right now.

335
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:04,611
Please.

336
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:06,779
Oliver, don't
make me do something

337
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:08,931
that both of us
will regret.

338
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,601
Ok! Ok. You win.

339
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:13,786
I'll help you.
Let him go.

340
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:17,957
Let...Him...Go!

341
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,733
Don't say it.

342
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,684
Ok.

343
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:37,853
Then let's talk
about Helena.

344
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,773
Oliver, if you didn't
still have feelings

345
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,309
for this girl, you would have thought
of a different solution

346
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:46,912
than letting her extort you
into killing someone.

347
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:48,413
So what do you want me to do?

348
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,815
You want me to kill her?

349
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:52,451
I think you would have
a long time ago

350
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,986
if she looked like me instead
of the T-Mobile girl.

351
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,821
She's a stone cold
killer, Oliver.

352
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:58,790
She's not evil.

353
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:02,344
She's been lost since her father
killed her fiancé in cold blood.

354
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,379
And are you going to sit there

355
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:07,832
and tell me that you don't know
what it's like to want revenge?

356
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,469
What would you do? Hmm?

357
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,488
If Floyd Lawton
was standing right there?

358
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,002
Nothing that will
involve blackmailing you

359
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:17,443
into hunting him down.

360
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,278
You're right.

361
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,814
Ok? I can't kill her.

362
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:25,033
And I can't take her
to the police

363
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:27,703
and risk her exposing
all of this.

364
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,538
But at least,
if I'm involved,

365
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,373
I can contain her, all right?

366
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,409
I can minimize
the collateral damage.

367
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,330
Sorry, am I...
interrupting something?

368
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,865
We were just...
talking about you.

369
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:43,585
And here I thought
you didn't care much for me.

370
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:45,003
Still don't.

371
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:46,705
I haven't been able
to locate the safe house

372
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,724
where the FBI
is keeping your father.

373
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:50,375
I can help with that.

374
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,377
I've been dying to hack into
the FBI security system.

375
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,730
Get out. Get out.

376
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:58,150
This is a private thing,
Felicity. Please.

377
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:01,737
Oh. Ok.

378
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:04,239
See ya, I guess...

379
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:11,029
How many girlfriends
do you have, exactly?

380
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:12,255
Like I said...

381
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,162
We don't know where
the safe house is.

382
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:15,584
What we do know
is that the Marshall service

383
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:17,569
is taking your father
to a hearing

384
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:19,621
at the Justice
Department tonight.

385
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:24,126
There's a problem...Helena.

386
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,744
There are two vans.

387
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:28,096
And one of them's a decoy.
Well, it's a good thing

388
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,765
there's two of us, then.

389
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,450
It's not too late
to call this off.

390
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,351
I think you know me
better than that.

391
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:36,087
I don't take prisoners.

392
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:44,730
Hey!

393
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:48,867
I found an intruder
while I was circling the perimeter.

394
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,040
It's Wilson.

395
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:58,910
You killed a few of my friends,
you son of a bitch.

396
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,829
And I'm going
to kill a few more.

397
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,476
I'll talk to one
of our lawyers

398
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:17,012
and have them
call you right back.

399
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,514
Cut yourself
shaving?

400
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:21,966
Hi.
Hey.

401
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,468
You got a minute?

402
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,520
Sure.

403
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:27,806
How was Roy's first day?

404
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:30,909
Kid never showed.

405
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:32,494
Um...

406
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:35,864
I just, uh, I came by
to apologize for last night.

407
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,116
Instead of an apology,

408
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,534
why don't you
try the truth?

409
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:41,820
You can start
with your wrist.

410
00:20:41,822 --> 00:20:45,340
I got into a fight
with a blender at the club.

411
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,292
It was stupid.

412
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:49,928
I thought I asked
for the truth.

413
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,714
I know something's up.

414
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:55,267
Why won't you tell me
what's going on?

415
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:58,653
Because I can't.

416
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,839
Why not?

417
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:06,645
I can't tell you that, either.
I wish that I could.

418
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,531
Laurel, I'm sorry.

419
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,899
So am I.

420
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,986
I really need you
right now, Tommy.

421
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:17,522
My mother shows up saying
my dead sister is still alive,

422
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:20,191
and my father is furious with me
that I'm even listening to her.

423
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:22,327
And I don't know
who to believe.

424
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:24,246
I feel like
I'm falling apart.

425
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:26,715
I'm still here for you.
No.

426
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,884
You're not.
You're a million miles away,

427
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:32,971
and the worst part is,
I don't even know why.

428
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,090
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,935
Wow. Stalker much?

430
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:49,738
You didn't show up
for the job I got you.

431
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,398
Yeah, I had second
thoughts about parking

432
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:52,441
your brother's Bentley.

433
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:54,392
What, being a valet
is beneath you?

434
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:57,729
No, but accepting charity
from some rich girl is.

435
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,114
Why are you so obsessed

436
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,749
with the fact
that I have money?

437
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,584
You know, money
isn't everything.

438
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:04,903
Spoken
like someone who's got it.

439
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:06,705
Now, uh, if you'll excuse me,

440
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:09,457
I need to get back
to my life of crime.

441
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,311
Yo, can you help me out?
Think I'm lost.

442
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,763
Where's downtown at?
I--I--I don't know.

443
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,982
Maybe you can give us
some directions.

444
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,768
Or better yet, some money--

445
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:50,882
You ok?

446
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:53,051
You're bleeding!

447
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,220
Yeah, that's what happens when
you get stabbed.

448
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:58,456
Ahh.

449
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:08,650
Just your father.

450
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:10,802
Anyone else gets hurt and
I'll put an arrow in you.

451
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:13,438
That's sweet.

452
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,026
Now I know how you charmed
your cop girlfriend.

453
00:24:39,742 --> 00:24:42,444
Give me Frank Bertinelli.

454
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,668
Your father's
not in the van.

455
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,121
But he sends his regards.

456
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:54,923
Where's the Hood?

457
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,125
Helena Bertinelli...

458
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:00,462
You have the right
to remain silent.

459
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:08,470
Damn it.

460
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:11,106
Anything you say can
and will be held

461
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:12,724
against you
in a court of law.

462
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:15,777
You have the right
to an attorney.

463
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,758
Paul Copani, Nick Salvati,
Gus Sabatoni.

464
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,728
You are quite the hunter,
Ms. Bertinelli.

465
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:42,398
Well, I guess I should
make that "Huntress."

466
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,383
You've been
systemically taking down

467
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:46,752
everyone in your father's
criminal organization.

468
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:50,223
When Gus Sabatoni
turned up dead,

469
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:51,557
we knew it was
just a matter of time

470
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:53,509
before you tried
to murder your old man.

471
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,078
Do you want
to tell us why?

472
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,748
Not particularly.
You should reconsider.

473
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,018
We got you,
but the vigilante got away

474
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,137
before E.S.U.
could move on him.

475
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:08,558
You know who he is.
Who he really is.

476
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,460
Don't you?

477
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:13,896
Ms. Bertinelli,

478
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,915
you're going away
for all day,

479
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,433
we can't change that.

480
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:20,019
But things
can be better.

481
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:23,255
Or they could be worse.

482
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:26,943
You tell me his name,
I will do everything I can

483
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:29,478
to make it better.

484
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:34,450
Oliver Queen.

485
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:38,221
You're dating him now, right?

486
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,624
I saw you at the opening
of his club last night.

487
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:45,061
Did he mention
that we used to be lovers?

488
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,447
We want to know about the Hood,
not Oliver Queen.

489
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:50,750
Let me let you in
on a little secret--

490
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,585
it's not going to work out
between you two.

491
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:55,588
You see, Oliver
has a particular talent.

492
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,174
He uses people.
He used me,

493
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,793
he used the detective
here's daughter--

494
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:04,397
excuse me--daughters.

495
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:09,068
I would get out of it

496
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,303
before you get yourself hurt.

497
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:14,790
Last chance.

498
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:17,693
His name.

499
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:21,597
The Hood.

500
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,584
What's going on?

501
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,319
I don't know.

502
00:27:33,377 --> 00:27:34,593
Go, get out of here!

503
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:36,646
Head for a door.

504
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:50,026
Freeze!

505
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:59,368
Sounds like quite
the daring rescue.

506
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,354
You're very lucky to have a friend
like Roy, Thea.

507
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,189
Oh, don't I know it.

508
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:06,525
We're not friends.

509
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:09,712
Well, let me get you
stitched up,

510
00:28:09,714 --> 00:28:13,466
and then you two can decide
what you are or aren't.

511
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:18,721
You are such a jerk.

512
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:21,557
Roy.

513
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,060
What's a matter?

514
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:25,845
Nothing.

515
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:27,263
I just don't see why
I need a shot.

516
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,183
Oh, don't tell me a tough
gang banger like yourself

517
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:32,768
is afraid
of a tiny little needle.

518
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,071
It doesn't look
so tiny.

519
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,556
Well, just think about
something else.

520
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,658
Besides the needle.

521
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,943
Like what?

522
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:43,496
Ok, now this could
sting a little.

523
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:52,071
Done.

524
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,425
Now that wasn't
so bad, was it?

525
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:04,249
Thanks for the save.

526
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,502
I couldn't risk you
telling the police about me.

527
00:29:06,504 --> 00:29:08,187
Is that the only reason?

528
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,257
Why can't you
just admit...

529
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,760
That you still have
feelings for me, too?

530
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,739
What is it?

531
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:29,658
A plane ticket to Rome,
and a passport

532
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,443
so you can start a new life

533
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:34,613
somewhere else.

534
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:38,050
The police know you're tracking
your father, Helena.

535
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:40,953
You'll never find him.

536
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:43,973
So get out of my city.

537
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,079
Place these around
the launcher.

538
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:15,004
Do it quickly. Their backup will be
arriving any second.

539
00:30:15,006 --> 00:30:17,957
We're 60 seconds out
from the launcher.

540
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:20,759
Set your final charges
and we'll blow it.

541
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,767
I think I have a better idea.

542
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,936
What are you doing?

543
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:33,189
I'm taking the circuit board.

544
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:36,058
Computers won't work
without them, and neither will this.

545
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,179
Leverage.

546
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:52,374
I'm sorry.
I should have called.

547
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:53,959
No, it's--it's ok.

548
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:55,161
Come on in.

549
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:56,896
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:57,963
Thank you.
I'm surprised,

551
00:30:57,965 --> 00:30:59,415
but I'm happy.

552
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,417
Yeah?
Yeah.

553
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:10,759
Everything ok?

554
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:13,729
I had a really rough night.

555
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:17,716
I just wasn't anticipating,
with my work and the club,

556
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:20,269
I feel like
I'm letting everybody down.

557
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:23,155
My family and Tommy

558
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:25,691
and...

559
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:29,028
You. I feel like
I'm letting you down.

560
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,696
You're being too
hard on yourself.

561
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:32,448
We both have
demanding jobs.

562
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,884
That's no excuse for hurting
the people closest to you.

563
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:37,386
No, but when you believe
in what you do,

564
00:31:37,388 --> 00:31:39,838
you find a way
to make it work.

565
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,074
How?

566
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:44,343
Well...

567
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:45,961
The first thing you do

568
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:48,080
is you find
yourself someone

569
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:51,784
you never have
to apologize to.

570
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:58,557
♪ Settle down with me

571
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,111
♪ cover me up

572
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:06,198
♪ lie down with me

573
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,268
♪ and hold me

574
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,603
♪ in your arms

575
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,744
♪ Your heart's
against my chest ♪

576
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,880
♪ your lips
pressed in my neck ♪

577
00:32:21,882 --> 00:32:26,001
♪ I'm falling for your eyes

578
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:28,554
♪ but they don't know me yet ♪

579
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:31,507
♪ And with a feeling
I'll forget ♪

580
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:34,260
Hey, it's me.

581
00:32:34,262 --> 00:32:37,096
I was multitasking,
and intercepted a police report.

582
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:39,298
A local sporting goods store
just got robbed

583
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,350
of one high powered cross bow.

584
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:42,851
Now...

585
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:45,187
Could be a crazy coincidence

586
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:47,973
or your psycho
ex-girlfriend--

587
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:50,359
Dig's words, not mine--

588
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:52,328
is still in town.

589
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,748
I'll let you know
if I learn anything more.

590
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,501
In the meantime,
just...watch your back.

591
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:01,003
Hi.

592
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,688
I don't think
we had a chance

593
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,489
to be properly
introduced this morning.

594
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:14,456
Felicity?
Oliver.

595
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:16,834
Oliver...

596
00:33:18,104 --> 00:33:20,605
I'm here.

597
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,175
You ok?

598
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:25,676
Hey, hey.

599
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:28,780
You ok?

600
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:31,349
I got your call.

601
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:34,185
What happened?
Helena.

602
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:36,738
She wanted the address to the
safe house where her father's being kept.

603
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,574
She made me hack
the FBI database.

604
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:41,376
Sorry, Oliver.
Hey.

605
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:43,912
It's not your fault.

606
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:48,550
Oliver, what are you
going to do?

607
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:50,351
What I should have done
in the first place.

608
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,788
Ahh!

609
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,843
Helena!

610
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:00,956
Code three, shots fired

611
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,773
at the Bertinelli
safe house.

612
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:04,742
This is Hall.
I'm onsite.

613
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:06,338
Wait
for back-up, Detective.

614
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:07,916
That's an order.

615
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,469
You won't shoot me.

616
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:16,671
You're not a murderer.

617
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:18,222
Remember?

618
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:19,974
But you are.

619
00:35:21,301 --> 00:35:23,653
And if I let you go,

620
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,606
that blood will be
on my hands.

621
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,961
I'm sorry.

622
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:38,667
I practiced that move.

623
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:43,339
I had a feeling
I might need it someday.

624
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:48,043
You would have killed me.

625
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:09,031
Enough!

626
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,916
Freeze!

627
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:16,675
Put it down.

628
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:18,511
Turn around.

629
00:36:18,513 --> 00:36:20,346
Slowly.

630
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:25,018
No!

631
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:41,841
McKenna?

632
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:10,780
Hey.

633
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:13,381
Hey.

634
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,948
How you feeling?

635
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,950
Uh, numb.

636
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,820
Hey, don't--
don't move.

637
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,288
Ok.

638
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,491
I met your doctor.
He's a nice guy.

639
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,809
Hmm.

640
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,277
He says you're
lucky to be alive.

641
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,614
Yeah. He also said

642
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,749
I have a shattered femur,

643
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,837
and it's going to take
at least a year to rehab.

644
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:42,258
I loved being a cop.

645
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,560
Oh, come on.
McKenna.

646
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,129
You're still a cop.

647
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,682
You have one more
surgery, go home--

648
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,517
I'm not going home.
What?

649
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,488
I'm moving to Coast City
to live with my sister.

650
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,000
They have the best
physical therapy facility

651
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,350
in the country there.

652
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,011
I'll visit.

653
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,498
Hey, I'm a billionaire, right?
Yeah.

654
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,649
I'll move to Coast City.

655
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:10,002
That's
very sweet, but...

656
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:12,872
Your club just opened.

657
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,657
And your work is here.

658
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,710
Don't worry about me.

659
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:21,097
It's my responsibility
to worry about you.

660
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,516
Just stop, ok?

661
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:26,435
Listen, you know
how I feel about you.

662
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:33,726
Please don't make this
harder than it already is.

663
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:38,531
Ok.

664
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,182
Ok.

665
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,451
It's, uh,

666
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,287
it's whatever you need.

667
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,701
Are you cleaning
out your desk?

668
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,921
No. A friend's.

669
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,473
Um...

670
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,392
You asked to see me.

671
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,260
Why don't you
take a seat.

672
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,895
Ok.

673
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:25,578
I'm ready to listen now.

674
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,251
Thank you.

675
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:41,627
Hey.

676
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,762
I, uh, heard
about McKenna.

677
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,465
You ok?

678
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,052
Not really.

679
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,607
Look, I know that I have been
a jerk lately.

680
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,725
I just couldn't
understand

681
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,595
how you could keep
such a huge secret from me.

682
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,064
But I--

683
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,618
I never considered
the toll it must take on you.

684
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,789
Lying to the people
that are closest to me.

685
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:14,159
It's the hardest part.

686
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,996
I get that.

687
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,634
I was wrong...

688
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:25,154
to think that I could
have it both ways;

689
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,891
that I could do what I do

690
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:33,062
and still have a normal life.

691
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,731
With anyone.

692
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,516
Except if you're alone,

693
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,302
you're never
going to be happy.

694
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,223
Maybe not.

695
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:50,646
But me being happy isn't
what's important right now.

696
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,419
Your plan,
your call.

697
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:04,260
Fyers.

698
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,211
Mr. Queen.

699
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,764
I thought I might
be hearing from you.

700
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,849
We have the circuit board.

701
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:13,852
You're making
a grave mistake.

702
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:17,022
My men are scouring
the island for you as we speak.

703
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:20,175
And when they find you,
they will kill you.

704
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,778
Very slowly, I'm afraid.

705
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,031
If your men kill us, then you'll
never find the circuit board.

706
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:28,484
And after that, we both know
that all you'll be left with

707
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,521
is a really ugly piece
of modern art.

708
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,708
What do you propose?

709
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,859
A trade.

710
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:40,045
I see.

711
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:43,048
And what do you want
in exchange?

712
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:49,368
I want a way off the island.

713
