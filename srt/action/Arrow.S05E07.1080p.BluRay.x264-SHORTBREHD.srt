1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,674
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,339
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:09,101
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,136
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,689
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,774
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,943
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,612
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,985
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,575
How long are you gonna be
staying here, man?

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,361
I'm a fugitive, Rene. I live here.

12
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:28,783
Why didn't you tell me

13
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,948
that Kovar was making a move
against the Bratva?

14
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>Well, Pakhan is going to be here
any moment. He'll explain everything.</i>

15
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,165
You're going to blow his new casino up.

16
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,334
Hello, Oliver Queen.
My name is Konstantin Kovar.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,093
Is there something you wanna tell me?

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,303
If that's code for
"are you still drinking,"

19
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,682
<i>then my answer hasn't changed
since the last 50 times you asked me.</i>

20
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,936
<i>Oliver, I think we have
a real lead on who Prometheus is.</i>

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,977
<i>He's</i> a <i>member of the SCPD.</i>

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,997
What's with the music?

23
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,452
It keeps the girls mellow.

24
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,244
She'll do. 5k.

25
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,288
Come on, man. Look at her. Seven.

26
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,499
Well, that's the Green Arrow.

27
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,418
Turning off the lights.
I heard he does that.

28
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,533
Run!

29
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,153
Come on, hoss. Ease up.
What's gotten into you today?

30
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,204
For the past three weeks,
I've either been living here or at HIVE.

31
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,786
Call it cabin fever.

32
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,951
Well, how about
you don't take it out on me?

33
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,413
I don't even know why you're teaching us
how to use these things.

34
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,082
What good is a wooden stick
if the other guy's got a gun?

35
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,421
You ever heard of Slade Wilson?

36
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,007
He could take you down
in about two seconds with a wooden stick.

37
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,758
Actually, they're more than
just wooden sticks.

38
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,552
They're from the Philippines,
and their technical name is...

39
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,768
Baston.

40
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,948
"All that most maddens and torments,

41
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,281
"all that cracks the sinews
and cakes the brain."

42
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,246
Rory, is that from the Torah?

43
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,823
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

44
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,664
Oh. Does that make me Ahab?

45
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,046
Well, if the obsessive
and really intense look fits...

46
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,499
Prometheus has stopped killing randoms.

47
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,089
You'd have to be as crazy
as he is to think he's stopped.

48
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,425
This guy's deliberate.
I mean, he has a very specific plan,

49
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,636
and we need to find him
before he executes the next phase of it.

50
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,184
But for now, we have a new problem,

51
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,940
or should I say another new problem?

52
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,895
Nathan Sierra and Pablo Estevez,
but I prefer douche bags one and two,

53
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,187
just showed up at SCPD.

54
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,355
Doing what?

55
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,149
I don't know. Just hanging around.

56
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,277
Damn.

57
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,072
What is it with this city
and serial killers lately?

58
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,497
Who says it's a new one?

59
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,159
Yeah. Look at the "V" on their faces.
That's not Prometheus' M.O.

60
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,577
Victimology doesn't fit either.

61
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,838
Sierra and Estevez both have rap sheets
for human trafficking.

62
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,671
SCPD thinks that these murders might
be the works of a different vigilante.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,126
How do you already know that?

64
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,717
I have an inside man at SCPD.

65
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,018
You mean your boyfriend,
or whatever he is. Who needs labels?

66
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,389
So either we're dealing with Prometheus
or another multiple murderer.

67
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,852
Either way, he has to be stopped.

68
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,525
Uh... Does he though?

69
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,025
Blondie's got a point.

70
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,187
Two less scumbags on the street.
What's the downside?

71
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,200
The downside is that we already have
one psycho loose in this city.

72
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,368
We can't afford to have another.

73
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,704
Who gets to decide who's a psycho
and who's a vigilante?

74
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,811
Mr. Queen, <i>dobry den.</i>

75
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,437
I thought you might enjoy
a break in my men's questioning.

76
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,234
I trust you'll show the proper manners.

77
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,991
Go ahead. Go ahead.

78
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,986
Please eat.

79
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:28,583
I must confess you've become
something of a fascination with me.

80
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,498
Oliver Queen.

81
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,422
Starling City's favorite son.

82
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,715
Presumed dead
after a maritime accident four years ago.

83
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,100
What do you want from me?

84
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,722
Answers.

85
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,430
You tried to blow up my casino.

86
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,775
Now my sources tell me
you've become Bratva.

87
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,440
I have many enemies,
but you're quite unique.

88
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,443
A week of questioning,

89
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,291
a week of torture,
and you've told my men nothing.

90
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,745
Except the occasional screaming
for a woman, to avenge her.

91
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,330
What was her name?

92
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,717
Taiana. Taiana.

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,597
Mmm.

94
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,510
Galina.

95
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,311
Mmm.

96
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,934
Galina.

97
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,163
Okay.

98
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,576
Lovely lady.

99
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,130
I believe you knew her daughter.

100
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,880
Taiana.

101
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,725
Yes. Yes. She came to me.

102
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,267
Galina came to me a year ago.

103
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:14,777
She said both her children,
Taiana, Vlad, had disappeared.

104
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,608
I said, "Do not worry.

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,070
"I'll get you a job so you can get by
while you wait for them to return."

106
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,244
And she's been here ever since.

107
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,336
- Sorry for the wait.
- No worries.

108
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,672
Gives me time
for this Twitter war I'm having

109
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,753
with an investigative journalist
from Russia.

110
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,381
What can I help you with?

111
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,467
So formal. That's not fun.

112
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,677
Susan, I've got
a million things to do today.

113
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,761
Including dealing with whoever dropped
two bodies on the SCPD's doorstep?

114
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,804
How do you know about that?

115
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,265
I believe it's called
being good at my job.

116
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,561
Susan, the city is still reeling
from the throwing star killings last week.

117
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm not looking to rile people up
if that's what you're implying.

118
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,317
I'm not implying anything.
I'm gonna ask you nicely

119
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,781
to please leave this alone
for the time being.

120
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,246
Okay. Fair enough.

121
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,998
Thank you.

122
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,425
- Okay...
- I know being mayor's a hard job, but

123
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,012
you look more in need
of a drink than anyone I've ever met.

124
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,299
You know, are you really surprised?

125
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,557
The police force is filled
with these corrupt officers,

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,770
the city has not gotten over
the serial murders last week,

127
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,435
and now there is
another psychotic in town.

128
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,031
Yeah, that does sound like
a whole lot of suck.

129
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,611
It just makes me wonder if what I'm doing
is having any positive effect.

130
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,913
Tonight, McGuire's, 9:00 p.m.

131
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,457
I'm gonna buy you
that drink you so desperately need.

132
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:01,334
I appreciate that,
but I don't, uh, need a date.

133
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,549
No, but you need a friend,
maybe even more than you need that drink.

134
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,637
See you tonight.

135
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,773
- Hey.
- Um..

136
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,646
Do you have a minute?

137
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,655
Branson's got a new poll
in the field as of last week,

138
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:33,290
and our approval ratings are up
but not as much as I would like.

139
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,493
Are you okay?

140
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,169
No, not even close.

141
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,750
Did you fall off the wagon?

142
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,586
Well, to do that I'd have to be on it.

143
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,803
You went to a meeting.
I took you there myself.

144
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,137
And I'm sorry.

145
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,201
Ready.

146
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,165
Let's roll.

147
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,671
Go! Go!

148
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,096
- Set.
- Ready...

149
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,895
Go! Go! Go!

150
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,740
Guys, we have incoming!

151
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,032
Guys! Hello!

152
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,463
Star City National Bank
robbery in progress.

153
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,748
We haven't had one of those in a while.

154
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,919
Suit up.

155
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,966
Felicity... Star City... No? Okay.

156
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,728
Tango spotted. Cover me.

157
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,224
- Clear.
- Clear.

158
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,434
Clear.

159
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,229
Overwatch, robbery's over. Suspect down.

160
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,069
We need immediate medical attention.

161
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,241
Vigilante.

162
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,160
Yeah, genius. That's what we are.

163
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,784
Vigilante did this.

164
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,124
These guys
are definitely my favorite crooks,

165
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,885
not that I'm condoning their actions,
just their choice in disguise.

166
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,045
- Really?
- Yeah.

167
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,056
I could totally see Paul and I's
next Halloween costumes.

168
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,466
That's almost a year from now.

169
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,601
Okay, back to things that actually matter.

170
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,638
The spooky crew's
been on a bit of a spree.

171
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,896
Yeah, more than a bit.

172
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,354
They've hit up seven banks in three states
over the past two weeks.

173
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,642
Who's running point?

174
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,150
Eric Dunn. It's not the first time
he's tried these scare tactics.

175
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,066
SCPD collared him in 2011
for multiple armed robberies.

176
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,032
He should be in Iron Heights for another
eight years trading cigarettes.

177
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,787
- So how'd he get out?
- Parole.

178
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,323
Our justice system at work.

179
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,994
Dunn must have formed a new crew.

180
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,082
So Dunn and this new crew hit the bank,
but Vigilante got there before you did.

181
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,872
Yeah, looks like he and his crew booked.

182
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,839
The guy they left in the bank,
however, did not make it.

183
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,877
The bank's CCTV coverage
got a glimpse at our new friend.

184
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,508
Okay, we are fighting a war on two fronts.

185
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,675
At least.

186
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,468
So we're stopping other vigilantes now?

187
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,015
I think what Evelyn's suggesting

188
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,897
is we're on the same side
as this Vigilante fella.

189
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,228
Really?

190
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,146
Because last week, all of you were pissed

191
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,358
when you found out that The Hood
used to play judge, jury, and executioner.

192
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,563
We can't have this both ways.

193
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,698
We're gonna find Dunn,
we're gonna find Vigilante

194
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,952
before any more banks get knocked over
or people get killed.

195
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,161
You don't believe me.

196
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,710
I believe Taiana.

197
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,709
She said you were a monster.

198
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,090
World is a complex place.

199
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,724
Who's to say who is the monster,
and who is the hero?

200
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,806
For example...

201
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,776
How does an American
become this Bratva devil?

202
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,117
<i>KOVAR". Recognize this man?</i>

203
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,073
Never seen him before.

204
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,413
Except in jail

205
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,248
where you snapped his neck
because the Bratva told you to do it,

206
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,253
because they told you
it would help to get to me.

207
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,421
A convenient lie
so they could steal his business.

208
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,928
And you killed this man,

209
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,434
and you gave the IP address

210
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,101
of a black market site
on the dark web to the Bratva.

211
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,940
It's a site the Bratva now controls,

212
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,528
like how they control you.

213
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,325
Good, evil, hero, monster.

214
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:28,035
My friend, truth is a matter
of perspective.

215
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,085
No more games.

216
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,250
You are gonna get me out of here.

217
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,836
You're late.

218
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,930
You didn't even know I was coming.

219
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,807
I dropped a resignation letter
on your desk.

220
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,718
You didn't think I'd expect you to show up
and try and talk me out of it?

221
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,353
And you can't, by the way.

222
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,311
And what makes you think
that I even want to, huh?

223
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,107
You lied to us, Quentin, repeatedly.

224
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,896
So what are you doing here then?

225
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,651
Look, you“.

226
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,531
You are like family to us, okay?

227
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,821
And I'm worried about you.

228
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,744
Well, I'm not sure I deserve your worry.

229
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,582
Yeah, neither am I, but I...

230
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,671
lam still here, aren't I?

231
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,174
Yeah, but that's not what I mean.

232
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,755
Listen, when I drink like this,

233
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,049
I black out,

234
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,468
I lose time,

235
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,011
and it's been happening a lot lately.

236
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:34,856
And last week, I woke up,
and I had blood on my hands and...

237
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,857
And this.

238
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,750
Uh, sorry, pal. We're just closing up.

239
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,707
Really? I was hoping
you could help me out.

240
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,042
It's kind of an emergency.

241
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,502
"Emergency"?

242
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,087
I'm going duck hunting tomorrow,
and I'm totally out of ammo.

243
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,843
Friend of mine said
that you might have the kind I need?

244
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,346
5.56-mil armor-piercing hollow points?

245
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,053
Big bullets for ducks.

246
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,056
Anyways, I'm closing up, so if you, uh...

247
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,681
Dude said it was an emergency, yo.

248
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,063
This is a nice shop.

249
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,646
Heard you're the only guy in town
selling 5.56-mil hollow points.

250
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,064
I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,614
Hey!

252
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,160
Every week, you get a shipment
of 5.56-mil hollow points.

253
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,320
You sell to one customer!

254
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,488
Hey, we had this handled.

255
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,701
I want a name!

256
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,583
I don't know who he is.
I haven't even seen his face.

257
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,079
He's always got the mask on.
Scary as hell, man.

258
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,246
Worse than you.

259
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,931
Hey, baby. Where you goin'?
My house is the other way.

260
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,174
Huh?

261
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,598
I said you're going the wrong way.
Oh, baby, don't be like that.

262
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,482
What's the matter, baby?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

263
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,779
He's not a ghost.

264
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,316
We have a few questions for you.

265
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,912
What the hell was that?

266
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,294
I thought I was supposed
to be the wild animal.

267
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,500
Wild Dog.

268
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,252
You totally lost it on that guy.

269
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,212
Hey, listen, if I lose it, you'll know it.

270
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,470
Rene's right. You were kind of unhinged,
which isn't your style.

271
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,096
- What's up?
- Nothing, man, forget about it.

272
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,177
Try us. We're empathetic.
Well, one of us.

273
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,442
Today's my son's second birthday.
I missed the party.

274
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,900
It's not because I've been
chasing down vigilantes either.

275
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,738
It's because the US Marshals
have my home under surveillance.

276
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,444
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

277
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,825
Feel stupid even talking about this, man.

278
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,038
It's not like J.J. will ever have
another second birthday,

279
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,041
it's not like I'll ever stop
being a fugitive.

280
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,794
Tell us where to find Dunn.

281
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,800
Please. I don't know
what Eric's been up to.

282
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,344
I lost touch with him when he went inside.

283
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,926
Sorry. My friend and I don't believe you.

284
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,431
How far could you throw him?

285
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,272
Oh, it depends on how many bones
you want broken.

286
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,734
Eric Dunn's out of prison
and robbing banks again.

287
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,441
Give us a line on him,
and we'll go harass him instead of you.

288
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,655
I told you. I haven't seen him in a while.

289
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,320
Three bones. Better yet, make it four.

290
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,530
But I know how he operates.

291
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,993
He picks banks based on
proximity to police stations.

292
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,207
Furthest first and works his way inwards.

293
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,044
It shouldn't take you too long to figure
out which place his crew will hit next.

294
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:45,799
Please.

295
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,550
Hurry, hurry!

296
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,552
We got a minute or two
before the blues get here.

297
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,467
It's not them I'm worried about.

298
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,011
Hey!

299
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,727
Get down!

300
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,905
You're right to worry.

301
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,144
I'm not here for you.

302
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,855
Then stop trying to kill us!

303
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,976
Dunn.

304
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,271
I'm going after him.

305
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,512
Hey! Keep your guns down.

306
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,975
So then you can just shoot me?
We're on the same side.

307
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,510
You're out of control.

308
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:24,566
This city is out of control,
and you haven't been able to save it.

309
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:30,693
Take one more step,
and one of you isn't going home tonight.

310
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,823
If you're not with me,
then you're against me.

311
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,203
Then I'm against you.

312
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,990
Then you're a dead man.

313
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,371
I think we scared him off.

314
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,507
He'll be back.

315
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,918
Kind of reminds me of you,
don't you think?

316
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,428
- Where are we?
- We got two bags of bones in ACU custody.

317
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,847
- And Dunn?
- In the wind.

318
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,390
The recruits are still out
looking for him.

319
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,895
Send them home. It's been a long night.

320
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,856
If we don't find Dunn
before Vigilante does, he's a dead man.

321
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,238
Look, you said that I inspired
this new wave of vigilantes,

322
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,774
but I don't think that's true.

323
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,410
I think that Vigilante
is out there right now

324
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,366
because we haven't been getting
the job done.

325
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,872
It's been four years,
and things have only gotten worse.

326
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,704
Oliver, you saved this city
10 times over.

327
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,038
At least.

328
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,919
And I've been trying
to be a legitimate hero,

329
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,705
which means that I lean on the courts
and the justice system.

330
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,545
The fact that someone like Eric Dunn

331
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,209
is out there right now
should tell us something.

332
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,467
Like what?

333
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,595
Maybe none of it's working.

334
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,726
Twitch and I will open your throat.

335
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,187
Now you tell your men
to put their guns down.

336
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,107
Do it!

337
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,739
All right. Let's go.
Come on. Move!

338
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,705
Go. Go.

339
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,081
I need a vehicle.

340
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,747
Mr. Queen, think about what you are doing.

341
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,007
I know exactly what I am doing.
Keep moving!

342
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,793
And your partner will be very displeased
by this course of action.

343
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,255
Oh, really?
Tell me, does his mom work here, too?

344
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,340
Actually, we've reached an accord.

345
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,433
The Bratva will lay off hostilities

346
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,888
as exchange for a percentage
of my casino's profits.

347
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,102
Your first two lies were more believable.

348
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,065
I told you,
truth is a matter of perspective.

349
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,480
Ask yourself which is more likely,

350
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,571
that the Bratva will let an American
into their brotherhood?

351
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,410
Or that they're using you
for whatever little value you can provide?

352
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,368
Or option three.

353
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,130
You're too weak
to know the difference.

354
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,337
Okay, so tell me what happened again.

355
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,346
We've been over this 100 times already.

356
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,349
Okay, so you must be getting really good
at telling it then.

357
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,974
Okay, the last few weeks,
I've been blacking out.

358
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,975
Last week, I woke up with, uh...
I don't know, all bloody,

359
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,064
and my arm's cut with that.

360
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,149
So I had a friend on the force run
forensics on it,

361
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,814
and it turns out that
that thing is consistent

362
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,324
with the Throwing Star Killer
and his victims.

363
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,619
Okay, so... So, what? You...

364
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,033
You think you're him, you're that guy?
I mean...

365
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,992
I don't know what to think anymore, Thea.

366
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,291
But, no, I don't think even my drinking
could turn me into a psychopath.

367
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,793
So why did you even resign then?

368
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,220
Because I lied to you

369
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,764
about going to the meetings, the drinking.

370
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,345
And now, this psycho, whoever he is,

371
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,346
he's messing with me.

372
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,355
He's targeting me.

373
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,977
I'm damaged goods, Thea.

374
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,156
I shouldn't be anywhere near close to you

375
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,196
or the mayor of our city.

376
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,539
This is a nice mask.

377
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,542
Do you prefer Bonesy,
or can I call you Laura?

378
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,253
Go to hell.

379
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,463
Okay, Laura it is then.

380
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,174
So, Laura,

381
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,215
it actually turns out that
I'm a lot more interested

382
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,975
in Eric Dunn than I am in you,

383
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,511
which makes this your lucky day. So...

384
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,982
Come on.
How about you just tell me where Eric is,

385
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,892
and I'll let you walk out of here.

386
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,359
I said, "Go to hell."

387
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,653
What? Do you need directions or somethin'?

388
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,238
No.

389
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,450
I've been to hell,

390
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:59,917
and that makes me somebody
that you do not want to screw with.

391
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,765
Try the Papp Motel.

392
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,316
That was impressive.

393
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,103
It got results at least.

394
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,732
I'm gonna reach out to Judge Balderrama,
get a warrant to move on the Papp Motel.

395
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,533
Should take about an hour, maybe two.

396
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,445
Quick as you can. I don't think
this Vigilante waits on warrants.

397
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,869
No, I bet he doesn't.

398
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,147
Do not reach for that gun.

399
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,814
I'm already dead.
The other masked crazy has me marked.

400
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,527
You know what's funny?

401
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,407
<i>The first time I got arrested,
I wasn't even guilty.</i>

402
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,655
They got the wrong guy,
but the D.A., they didn't care.

403
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,781
<i>They had to pin the crime on someone.</i>

404
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,624
I was a good kid.

405
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,495
I spent two years in Iron Heights.

406
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,293
I wasn't a good kid after that.

407
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,199
Door! Now!

408
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,171
<i>When Star City firefighters
responded late tonight,</i>

409
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,383
<i>they found three as yet to be identified
victims dead inside the adjacent...</i>

410
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,095
Anyone still think that Vigilante
doesn't need to be stopped?

411
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,225
To be fair,
the story Dunn laid out is legit.

412
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,604
His conviction in '07 could be the basis
for <i>Making</i> a Murderer Season 2.

413
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,184
Eric Dunn
might not be a choir boy,

414
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,724
but he doesn't deserve a death sentence.

415
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,104
Point made.

416
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,315
The question being,
how do we stop Vigilante?

417
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,024
Better yet, how do we find him?

418
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,898
Well, we have Dunn
in protective custody downstairs.

419
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,737
I guess we can't just leave him
hog-tied on Main Street

420
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,401
and then wait for Ski Goggles to show up.

421
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,036
Let's assume that's not Plan A.

422
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,409
We work the problem.

423
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,119
All right. I have to go see someone.

424
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,454
At this time of night?

425
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,913
Who are you meeting?
'Cause we're all here.

426
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:48,297
I'm meeting Susan Williams
at a bar for mayor's office stuff.

427
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,254
"Mayor's office"? Sounds like a date.

428
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,757
If you get anything new, please call me.

429
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,933
He's totally going on a date.

430
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,177
Yep.

431
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,109
All right. So we're here. Where's here?

432
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,987
It's a place called New Oasis.

433
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,944
- Rehab?
- You need it, Quentin.

434
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,108
I don't think so, not with everything
that's going on right now.

435
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,199
- It's just not the time.
- This is exactly the right time,

436
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,989
and you know it.
Everything has just been an excuse

437
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,205
keeping you away
from feeling what you need to.

438
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,495
I suppose you're gonna tell me
exactly what that is.

439
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,417
I don't have to.

440
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,511
Laurel.

441
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,346
I know you think that you have dealt
with your grief on this

442
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,649
but all of this drinking
is saying otherwise.

443
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:50,150
It just hurts, you know? It just hurts
so much. It just hurts so much.

444
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,359
I know. I know. I know.

445
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,947
And the worst thing is knowing
how ashamed she'd be of me right now.

446
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,123
She wouldn't be ashamed of you, Quentin.

447
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,375
She would be concerned, okay?
Just like I am.

448
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,677
You know,
I used to get shot at for a living.

449
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,337
I don't know what it is
about this building

450
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,472
that's got me so scared.

451
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,597
We're afraid of things we don't know,

452
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,482
especially when we've been living
in pain this long.

453
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,111
It's hard to even accept
the idea of being happy.

454
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,488
Yeah.

455
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,159
When'd you become so wise, huh?

456
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:42,498
I've been through a lot,
in the last four years.

457
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,370
Yeah.

458
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,870
Your mother would be proud of you.

459
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,091
Why don't you go in there
and make Laurel proud of you?

460
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,718
What about being deputy mayor?

461
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,384
It will be waiting for you
right when you get back.

462
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,715
I promise.

463
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,555
Thanks.

464
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,514
For everything.

465
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,899
Thank me by getting better.

466
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,720
That's what you get
for leaving the corner pocket open, pal.

467
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,258
Good game.

468
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,225
- Hi.
- Ah, you are here.

469
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,851
You play pool?

470
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,981
Well, if by "play" you mean "win,"
then yeah.

471
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,734
- One drink as promised.
- Oh.

472
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,489
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

473
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,028
Oh.

474
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,082
Okay, the friend part...

475
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,075
Try me.

476
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,796
I'd say that this is off the record,
but I'm pretty sure it's public knowledge.

477
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,331
- Um...
- Okay.

478
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,754
This job...

479
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,222
This job has proven to be a little bit
more difficult than I expected.

480
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,514
What's occasioning
the dark night of the soul?

481
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,388
It's tough to explain.

482
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,568
Let's say, that there
was someone else in my position,

483
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,854
but they were more extreme than I am.

484
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,986
And you don't want to go there.

485
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,320
I don't want to go there.

486
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,734
Okay.

487
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,327
But they've gone there,

488
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:49,367
which makes me question
if what I'm doing is actually effective.

489
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,377
I'm trying to come at things differently.

490
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,166
I'm trying to be more optimistic, for me.

491
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,668
Nah, but it just feels like...

492
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,714
It's one step forward, two steps back?

493
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,263
That's it.

494
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,551
I think that's what's called
"being in charge."

495
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,600
Look, the truth is,
you're all this city has.

496
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:17,854
So, however you go about your business,
just keep doing it the right way.

497
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,481
Even if it takes longer
to get the job done,

498
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,617
you'll know, and so will the city.

499
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,576
Will they?

500
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,116
Really.

501
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,579
So, stop being so hard on yourself.

502
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,464
Technically, that is your job.

503
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,837
Damn right.

504
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,391
You work very late hours, Mr. Queen.

505
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,555
You've no idea,
and, Susan, call me Oliver.

506
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,567
Hey. We can't find Vigilante,

507
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,728
but I think we figured out a way
to draw him out.

508
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:00,942
Talk to me.

509
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,739
How do you feel about us robbing a bank?

510
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,967
God, it's so hot in that mask!

511
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,095
- I'm used to it.
- Security cameras.

512
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,927
<i>- I'm on it.
- Maybe I wasn't paying attention</i>

513
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,682
during the briefing,
but isn't the point to get caught?

514
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,842
Yeah, not by the cops.

515
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,553
That's why I'm only cutting lines to SCPD.

516
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,392
You two take the safe upstairs.
I'll cover Felicity.

517
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,602
Okay, isn't that taking
the method acting a little far?

518
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,891
We have to make this look legit.

519
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,605
I can't wait to explain
that at my arraignment.

520
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,442
Terrific, Artemis, we're on the move.
Anything going on outside?

521
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,696
Negative. All quiet out here.

522
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,337
This was easy.
Maybe we're in the wrong line of work.

523
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,679
You had to say it was easy.

524
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,637
Call your boss.
We need to have a chat.

525
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,593
- Don't listen to him!
- Shut up!

526
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,186
Call him. Do it now.

527
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,983
They don't have to. I'm right here.

528
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,941
Tell your friends to beat it.
This is between us.

529
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,741
Do it, or I'll waste him and then you.

530
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,461
Go. I've got this.

531
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,917
There was a girl outside.

532
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,340
She's still breathing.
She'll wake up with a headache, though.

533
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,971
What do you want?

534
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,173
To operate without interference.

535
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,805
- So you can keep killing people?
- Criminals.

536
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,686
Like the people at the motel?

537
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,684
Collateral damage.

538
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,399
You don't seem to know that this is a war.

539
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,644
Maybe that's why you're losing.

540
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:05,854
<i>We have to move!</i>

541
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,398
We can't just leave him there
with that nut job!

542
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,692
The guy's got a gun right
to Curtis' head, Blondie.

543
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,201
But there's no way
we can be faster than a bullet.

544
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,993
What is he doing just standing there?

545
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,364
Don't worry. He's got this.

546
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,208
You got a lot of faith, man.

547
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,418
- Green Arrow...
- Shut up!

548
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,544
You're not getting the job done

549
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,583
because you don't take it
seriously enough,

550
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,213
maybe because you haven't lost anyone.

551
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,726
You don't have a full understanding
of what's out there.

552
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:40,355
Oh, I've lost people,
almost more than I can bear.

553
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,983
Then it hasn't been
more than you can bear.

554
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,818
Maybe you need a push!

555
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,027
You're right.

556
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,156
This is a war,
but I'm gonna fight it the right way

557
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,202
because I am all this city has.

558
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,172
Curtis!

559
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,214
Come on.

560
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,969
In the field, I prefer Mr. Terrific,
if you don't mind.

561
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,304
Where's Ski Goggles?

562
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,931
Gone.

563
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,290
Hey. Heard about the Vigilante.
I'm sorry he got away.

564
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,001
He will be back, and I'll get him.

565
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,791
You always do.

566
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,297
But, uh, I...

567
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,879
- I need to talk to you about Quentin.
- Okay.

568
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,511
He found this in his apartment last week.

569
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,762
Somebody is going
through a lot of trouble

570
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,226
to make it look like
he's behind the throwing star killings.

571
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,351
Why would Quentin believe that?

572
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,687
Because he's been blacking out.

573
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:58,528
Look, he's in a rehab.
He's just taking some time.

574
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,457
But I've been wondering why would
somebody be targeting him, and...

575
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,750
The only thing I can think of...

576
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,371
What if Prometheus
knows I'm the Green Arrow?

577
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,881
I've killed men for less than this.

578
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,307
So try, or are you gonna turn down
a challenge in front of your men?

579
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,894
Maybe that means
you're too weak to know the difference.

580
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,728
You will not interfere.

581
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,431
What madness is this, huh?
Kovar, we had a deal.

582
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,594
Your man did not believe me.
I was trying to convince him.

583
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,144
If he dies, it's coming out of your cut.

584
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:14,736
You believe me now, Mr. Queen?

585
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,780
Your precious Bratva
and I have made a deal.

586
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,278
Truth

587
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,571
is a matter of perspective.

588
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,926
Jeez! Do you ever not work out?

589
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,097
I have a few things
to get off my chest, remember?

590
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,472
I do, but I got a better solution.

591
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,857
Little man, look at you! Come here.

592
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,190
Oh.

593
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,658
How are you doing?

594
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,911
- Am I sweaty? What do you say?
- Mmm-hmm.

595
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,821
- You're sweaty.
- I'm what?

596
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,205
You're sweaty.

597
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,662
Yes, I am a little sweaty.
Did you plan this?

598
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,957
You couldn't make it to the party, so...

599
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,996
We could bring the party to you.

600
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,335
What about the US Marshals?

601
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:20,047
We did three SDRs.
Marshals are halfway to Hub City by now.

602
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,961
Hey, you want some cake?

603
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,175
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

604
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,510
- Go get some cake.
- Let's get some cake.

605
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,549
Hey, you. I love you.

606
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,976
Go get some cake, man.

607
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,353
Thanks for doing this, brother.

608
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,022
What are friends for?

609
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,572
<i>Hey, come here. Come here.</i>

610
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,493
Fellas, can you give us a minute, please?

611
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,500
I was just headed out for the night.

612
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,206
I know.

613
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,880
I, uh, may or may not
have had one of the guys

614
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,216
on your detail text me
when you were headed out.

615
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,848
Wow.

616
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,225
Thank you for the other night.
That was, um...

617
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,935
That was some good advice
and a good drink.

618
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,233
Well, now you owe me the drink.

619
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:25,946
Should we go now?

620
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,620
- Really?
- Let's go.

621
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,722
Don't worry. Nobody followed me.

622
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,597
They don't suspect a thing.
