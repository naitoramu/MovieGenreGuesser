1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,671
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,510
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,892
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,270
<i>Today I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,772
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its Mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,025
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,935
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,654
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,359
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,116
Former Police Captain, Quentin Lance.

11
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,197
Who'll be serving beside me
as Deputy Mayor.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,783
Appreciate the vote of confidence,
Mr. Mayor.

13
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,541
- Are you not from Star City?
- No. Havenrock.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,702
<i>There's something
that I need you to know.</i>

15
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,291
Havenrock was not the intended target.

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:41,004
Someone redirected the missile
to reduce the number of casualties.

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,168
That someone was me.

18
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,635
- Ever since I killed Andy...
- You think you need to be punished.

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,266
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.

20
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,644
We need to talk about John. He's back
in the country. And he's in prison.

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,180
And I need you to break him out.

22
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,769
<i>Come on, Mr. Olympia. Hustle up.</i>

23
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:05,032
Mr. Olympia is a bodybuilding competition.
I was... Am an Olympic athlete.

24
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,613
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?

25
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,119
<i>Very funny.
And it was a bronze medal.</i>

26
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,404
<i>Why is that so hard to remember?</i>

27
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,245
Quiet. Every time you're out in the field,
you could die.

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,627
Don't forget that. Don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?

29
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,503
Headed towards the east exit,
closing fast.

30
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,335
- Do we know what he stole?
- Not yet.

31
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,170
But I have a feeling
we're about to find out.

32
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,007
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.

33
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,388
Does this mean
I actually get to shoot someone?

34
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,721
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone,
shoot someone. I just meant more that...

35
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,386
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon,

36
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,647
- then engage. Do you copy?
- Copy.

37
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,935
- Copy.
- Copy. Still a lot of ground to cover.

38
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,944
Rag should be here.

39
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,276
Overwatch, do you have
a 20 on Ragman?

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,659
I texted him, like, 10 times,
and then 10 more, but nada.

41
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,320
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around.

42
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,533
And by the looks of those rags,

43
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,198
he does not hit the dry cleaner
very often.

44
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,623
- Hola, muchacho.
- Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.

45
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,043
I got him. What the...

46
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,594
<i>I</i> got him.

47
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,130
What did I say? That was Artemis' shot!

48
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,675
- Dude was getting away.
- No, he wasn't.

49
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,684
And you missed.

50
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,767
You were in the Navy,
you should know better.

51
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,479
I was dishonorably discharged, actually.

52
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,268
Do you think that I don't know that?

53
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:11,488
Deliver that and the evidence
to the Anti-Crime Unit and then go home.

54
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,448
- What about tonight's training session?
- You're taking a few days off.

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,583
Nice going. Again.

56
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,670
How we supposed to get this guy
to the ACU? Call an Uber?

57
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,104
Oliver?

58
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,477
The op's over and you've been MIA
for days. It's not acceptable.

59
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,237
Get it together immediately,
or you're off the team.

60
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,649
That's why I'm here,
to tell you in person.

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,197
I'm off the team.

62
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,987
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.

63
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,781
I thought you were just getting started.

64
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,123
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth
about her role in Havenrock.

65
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,499
You didn't know she told me.

66
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,836
Did she also tell you that she was faced
with an impossible choice?

67
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,501
I completely realize that.

68
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,177
I get it wasn't her fault.

69
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,130
But that doesn't change
the fact that every time I look at her,

70
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,220
I see the faces of my family,

71
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,259
of everyone I ever loved.

72
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,521
Felicity is a constant reminder
of what I lost.

73
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,149
And as long as that's true, I'm sorry,
I can't be here.

74
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,272
What about your father?

75
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,154
I thought he was the reason
you were doing this.

76
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,529
I'll have to find another way
to honor him.

77
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,036
- I'm sorry to lose you.
- And I'm sorry to go.

78
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,121
Thank you. For everything.

79
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,290
Did my comms deceive me,

80
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,834
or did you actually let the recruits take
an SCPD victory lap?

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,252
It's never a victory lap.

82
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,264
They're rough around the edges,
but they're making progress.

83
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,302
Except Rory, who was waiting for me
upstairs to say that he quit.

84
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,972
He said you spoke with him
about Havenrock.

85
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,980
<i>He'!-</i>

86
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,777
- How you holding up?
- She doesn't know?

87
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,567
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me. I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,909
What Lyla means...
We are going to break him out.

89
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,536
- Of military prison?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,996
Wait, and then what? John is just
a fugitive for the rest of his life?

91
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,753
Better than being punished for something
he didn't do.

92
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,125
Well, I've been studying the schematics
that you hooked me up with.

93
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,386
This would be a lot easier
if we had John's cooperation.

94
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,922
You don't have what now?

95
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,511
Apparently prison
is more appealing to John

96
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,221
than coming home
to his own wife and child.

97
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,887
Okay, so wait a minute. Not only do you
want to commit multiple felonies,

98
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,398
and make John a wanted man for the rest of
his life, he doesn't actually want you to?

99
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,356
- Can I speak with you for a minute?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,865
- Is she going to be a problem?
- No.

101
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,118
But I was counting on her being a help.

102
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,200
Maybe I should pull
a few of my agents in on this.

103
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,707
Lyla, if this has your fingerprints on it,

104
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,040
then both of John, Jr.'s parents
will be fugitives.

105
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,048
There is something that might actually
make this not impossible.

106
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,507
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece
of tech, an anti-molecular compound.

107
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,133
I was kind of hoping Felicity
could help us get our hands on it...

108
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,097
Lyla. Whatever it is, I'll handle it.

109
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,607
Second test over.

110
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,527
Do not make any worse
by pulling out sutures.

111
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,983
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva
treat their new members,

112
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,819
I'd hate to see
how they treat their enemies.

113
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,779
Pass third and final test, find out.

114
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,782
- What's the test?
- You keep asking about Kovar.

115
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,034
Our sources say this man
will get you one step closer.

116
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,078
You have to act fast though.
He will be arraigned in morning.

117
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,088
- Arraigned?
- Jail.

118
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,922
Yeah.
But what makes you think he'll talk to me?

119
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,008
You trust me. I trust you.

120
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,974
It's a little early for a drink,
don't you think?

121
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,844
Is not for drinking.

122
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,025
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?

123
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,091
I should probably just start pre-recording
apologies for being late.

124
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,677
Don't worry. Thea told us. I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.

125
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,095
Yes, it is.

126
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,887
I'm actually going to be taking some
time off to have it taken care of.

127
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:55,024
Well, fortunately, we now have
a Deputy Mayor to help pick up the slack.

128
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,153
It'll be great working with you. You've
had an impressive career, Mr. Lance.

129
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,821
Yeah. I mean, a lot of people out there

130
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,274
probably wouldn't share that opinion,
but thank you.

131
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,029
Public service isn't easy.

132
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,532
Sometimes you get a little dirty
clearing out the filth.

133
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,789
Speaking of which,
I heard there was an arrest last night

134
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,915
that may help
in our case against Tobias Church?

135
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,954
Sergio Espinosa. Long-time Los Halcones
member turned Church strong man.

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,748
The Green Arrow
and his merry band of vigilantes

137
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,882
left him giftwrapped for us at Anti-Crime.

138
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,839
The only thing that was missing was a bow.

139
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,973
- You don't sound too happy about that.
- Vigilantes are a superficial solution.

140
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,849
If we need their help
to get our streets clean...

141
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,227
It means we haven't done our jobs right.

142
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,935
Do you think that you can get Espinosa
to flip on Church?

143
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,107
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.

144
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,984
Make sure he doesn't get any help
from crooked cops.

145
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,144
Not a chance.

146
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,938
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence
in the custody chain through myself.

147
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,858
Good. Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you.

148
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,904
Be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.

149
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,447
Sure. Give us a little bit of time
to get acquainted.

150
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,698
Hmm.

151
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,534
- Great.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,796
Um...

153
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,296
Sorry, when did, uh, babysitting evidence
become part of the job description?

154
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,835
Since I trust you.

155
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,923
You do?

156
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,679
I mean, all things considered...

157
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,468
If we didn't think you were right for the
job, we wouldn't have offered it to you.

158
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,927
Right?

159
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,521
I haven't had a drink in a week, okay?

160
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,770
Where the hell are you going, anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.

161
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,152
You should probably assume
that it's not a vacation.

162
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,649
Should I even ask?

163
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,527
No. I'm not gonna be gone long.

164
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,819
Just please make sure that no one
destroys the city while I'm away.

165
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,071
- Sure.
- Okay.

166
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,209
- What are you doing?
- Reviewing the SCPD evidence log

167
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,337
on what we kept from getting stolen from
Kord Industries last night.

168
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,756
- A 6800 processor.
- So?

169
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,091
Exactly. Kord manufactures bleeding-edge
tech, military-grade weapons.

170
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,256
I mean,
all kinds of city-threatening items.

171
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,802
Why would Church send a guy to steal
a computer chip

172
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,844
that you could buy
from any Tech Village store?

173
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,019
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lock-up now.

174
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:02,228
Well, because knowing what
Church's endgame was is like...

175
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,530
It's like this thing that's
still out there. Lurking.

176
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,109
You all right over there?

177
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,030
Because I've been doing a lot of talking
and you haven't.

178
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,619
Which is very weird.

179
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,579
You know how you
told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?

180
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,544
Yeah? Oh, he's not sick
with the flu, is he?

181
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,216
No. He's just

182
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,711
sick of working with me.

183
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,925
Did you try talking to him?

184
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,221
There's not a lot I can say
that would make him feel okay

185
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,222
about his entire family being killed.

186
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,316
Incoming. Another robbery in progress at...

187
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,351
Palmer Tech. Gotta call Oliver.

188
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,566
Or maybe don't
and we just let them get robbed.

189
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,403
It'll serve Mr. Dennis right
for firing us.

190
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,619
- He fired me. You quit.
- Because he fired you. Same thing.

191
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,076
<i>Hey, Sanchez,
you got anything?</i>

192
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,240
Nada.

193
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,580
<i>Okay, I'll kill the alarm.</i>

194
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,151
What's up?

195
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,485
Hey, there's been a break-in
at Palmer Tech. Are you still in the area?

196
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,112
Uh, yeah. I can look into that.

197
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,743
How was Palmer Tech?

198
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,584
<i>Before you answer, you should consider
that your phone has GPS.</i>

199
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,091
And if you were thinking of lying,
I do admire your consistency.

200
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,969
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.

201
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,383
I wasn't looping you in after you made it
clear you didn't approve of the decision.

202
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,971
John is the one
who doesn't approve of the plan.

203
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,387
- John is not thinking clearly.
- Well, I bet Roy is.

204
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,100
And if he were here,
I think he would tell you

205
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,311
that life on the run is no life at all.

206
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,522
And I seem to remember you not being
on board with that plan.

207
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,272
Roy was making a bad choice.
Just like John is making a bad choice.

208
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,701
He is currently locked up in a military
prison for a crime he didn't commit.

209
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,780
To atone for a crime that he did commit.
And what does it matter?

210
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,744
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.

211
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,704
Why do you always have to go
and make decisions for him?

212
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,539
He already abandoned the team.

213
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,703
Lam not going to let him
abandon his family.

214
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,123
Is that what this is about?
John leaving the team?

215
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,836
This is simple.

216
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,763
Lam gonna stop John from making
a decision he will come to regret.

217
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,597
You should consider doing
the exact same thing with Rory.

218
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,932
You do realize that me having
a chat with Rory

219
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:46,020
is completely different than you
committing half a dozen felonies, right?

220
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,357
Did you ever think you'd be doing
this again? Handling evidence?

221
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,773
No. Didn't think I'd be
Deputy Mayor either, but here we are.

222
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,317
I was surprised you took the job,
to be honest.

223
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:59,530
From what I hear, you and Queen
have a, uh, complicated history.

224
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,490
Gotta be a lot of hatchets to bury there.

225
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,706
Yeah, well,
at least I know where they're buried.

226
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,666
That's something you can't buy or steal.

227
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,096
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor too.

228
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,762
Ah, bonus. Get ready to move.

229
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,400
Let me guess. Felicity filled you in.

230
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,907
That you're going to break
into a military prison, yeah.

231
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,113
And you got the nerve to call me
"Wild Dog."

232
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,744
- I'm done debating this.
<i>- Really?</i>

233
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,872
Because this is the first we've heard
of it. I thought we were your team.

234
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,830
Running off to bust someone out of
prison sounds like team business.

235
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,336
And what happens to us
when you get caught?

236
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,213
You've made it clear that we can't do
this vigilante thing without you.

237
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,420
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.

238
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,927
Right.
Because we're not gonna let you do this.

239
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,430
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,185
Did you say that you're not gonna
"let" me?

241
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,058
Yes. I need to see you physically
deposit the item.

242
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,976
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.

243
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,568
Now, relax, Sergeant. No one's doubting
your proficiency here. Okay?

244
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,776
Seems like.

245
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,289
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?

246
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,002
Have at it.

247
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,641
What the...

248
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,066
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get out of here!

249
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,075
Whoo!

250
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,626
Find the weapons, boys.

251
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,624
<i>Ah.</i>

252
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,006
Sorry, gents. Load them up!

253
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,304
And burn this puppy down.

254
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,684
Let's go, let's go. Get out! Go!

255
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,195
Okay.

256
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,024
Last chance.

257
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,034
Get off the street.

258
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,455
Oh!

259
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,477
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.

260
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,433
You know what really sucks?

261
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,439
Realizing that
in all those training sessions

262
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,566
where he was kicking our respective asses,
the whole time

263
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,227
he was taking it easy on us.

264
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,067
Yeah, remind me to never,
ever get on his bad side.

265
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,569
I think that would imply
that he has a good side.

266
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,703
And you know, Felicity, could you please
explain to me again

267
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,535
how you thought
this was all gonna go down?

268
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:34,077
I thought if he saw you guys all united
against his crazy plan, he'd reconsider.

269
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,463
Right, because Oliver Queen is known
for thinking things through

270
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,919
and taking input from others.

271
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,458
<i>Right.</i>

272
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,419
Wow.

273
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,344
- The ever-expanding clubhouse.
- And who are you?

274
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,768
- I'm Thea. Oliver's chief of staff.
- And also his sister.

275
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,935
- Don't tell me, Oliver beat you up too.
- Wait, Ollie did this?

276
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,271
Object lesson. Long story. It's fine.
Don't ask. What happened to you?

277
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,357
Tobias Church happened.

278
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,861
That "evidence" that you guys recovered
from Kord Industries?

279
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,574
- Modified to go boom.
- He wanted it to be put into lockup.

280
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,290
He wanted to raid it.
That's one-stop shopping for weapons.

281
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,793
Including those RPGs that he took from
AmerTek, if this report's right.

282
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,000
We gotta find out what he's planning
to do with those weapons

283
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,664
'cause it ain't nothing good.

284
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,878
This is a really bad time for Oliver
to be out of town.

285
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,760
Yeah. Just tried him. He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?

286
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,172
We wanna figure out what Church is up to
before it's too late.

287
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,715
- You sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

288
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,142
I don't think Oliver would want us
out there without him.

289
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,179
Right. Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion
when he left.

290
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,315
Okay. But this is
an "all hands on deck" situation.

291
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,976
Rag-covered hands included. Just saying.

292
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,207
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.

293
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:59,416
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.

294
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,711
I don't see you on the list.

295
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,009
Your C.O. should have submitted
a change of personnel form.

296
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,301
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.

297
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,467
Can't you refresh your WiFi or something?

298
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,355
There you are. As you were, Private.

299
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,685
Thank you, sir.

300
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,677
I'm in.

301
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,648
Twenty-five minutes till extraction.

302
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,729
Roger that.

303
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,569
Facility's cameras
are on a closed network.

304
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,280
If you can get me access to the mainframe,
I can open it up.

305
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,911
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver.

306
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,617
If you don't make it
to the extraction point...

307
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,623
I'll make it. And I won't be alone.

308
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,225
Hey, do you speak English?

309
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,190
Yes.

310
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,611
Your accent, you're American?

311
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,108
Yeah, maybe once upon a time.

312
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,618
But now I'm more just enjoying
everything that Russia has to offer.

313
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,700
Yes, I can smell that.

314
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>W W“ Midge me...</i>

315
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,666
You're in this cell, too.

316
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,382
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.

317
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,419
You mean Konstantin Kovar?

318
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,008
How do you know that name?

319
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,889
You know, the same that way that I know
you're name's Pyotr Friedkin.

320
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,267
Same way I know that
you launder money for Kovar.

321
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,181
- Same way that I know...
- That's what you're doing here.

322
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,437
How can you know that? Unless...

323
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,237
Are you Bratva?

324
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,941
Huh?

325
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,498
He's fine.

326
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,164
Hmm. Hmm.

327
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,374
I am Bratva.

328
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,920
And you are going to tell me
everything that I want to know.

329
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,892
Your turn to run systems check.
I'm gonna hit the hay.

330
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,677
Don't touch my ball.

331
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,875
Dude. What the hell?

332
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,045
Transponder's in place.

333
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,383
Roger that. I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.

334
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,021
Hey! Hey, is this a bad time?

335
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,071
Do I want to even ask how you found me?

336
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,410
I feel like that's a trick question.

337
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,997
Sorry about the mess.

338
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,492
Wow.

339
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,248
These are amazing!

340
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,671
You spend enough time
with other people's castoffs,

341
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,919
you find ways
to make something useful out of them.

342
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,379
My father always used to say that.

343
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,254
- He owned a pawn shop.
- On Southmoor Road, right?

344
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,591
How did you know?

345
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,228
Last week, you told Oliver that you had
joined the team to honor your father.

346
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,889
When you quit,

347
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,687
I wanted to find out more
about what you were giving up.

348
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,398
Your father was a Gulf War veteran.
2nd Battalion, 1st Marines.

349
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,035
But that's not what made him a hero,
was it?

350
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,120
No.

351
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,080
He wore your rags.

352
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:50,119
Like his father before him,
whose name was also Rory.

353
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,839
That's a big legacy to live up to.

354
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,002
Mine is going to be
what happened to Havenrock.

355
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,013
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that.</i>

356
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,677
Every day for the rest of my life,

357
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,763
knowing that I cannot fix it.

358
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,850
And knowing that it's not the last mistake
that I'm ever gonna have to make.

359
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,271
- I still don't know if I can...
- Work <i>side by side</i>

360
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,481
<i>with someone who's a reminder
of what you lost.</i>

361
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,940
I understand.

362
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:20,321
Just like you're a reminder of what I did.
And I know they're not the same thing.

363
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,533
We both want the same thing,
to be able to live with what's happened

364
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,323
so that we can move forward.

365
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,503
It's Curtis.

366
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,344
I am so sorry.

367
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,680
And we could really use you.

368
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,009
I wish I could, Felicity. I just...

369
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,438
I can't right now. I'm sorry.

370
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,691
If you change your mind, well, we're here.

371
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,032
<i>Cell 1138.</i>

372
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,989
Right side, third from the left.

373
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,870
- Harbinger, he's not here.
- Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.

374
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,589
- Oh, no.
- What?

375
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,504
They moved him into Gen Pop.

376
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,795
You go in there,
neither of you are getting out.

377
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,730
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?

378
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,104
Outside our window.

379
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,310
<i>Those MPs wake up, the first thing
they're gonna do is move John</i>

380
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,196
and all the other prisoners to a more
secure location and we lose our shot.

381
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,408
Abort. We're blown.

382
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,197
Tell me where I can find Kovar.

383
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,874
- You think you scare me more than him?
- No.

384
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,957
But he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.

385
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,792
You wouldn't kill me
in front of all of them.

386
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,929
I'm not going to lay a finger on you.

387
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,724
Same can't be said for Alisa.

388
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:14,480
Or maybe I'll visit your wife, Maya,
when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.

389
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,686
Somebody is gonna die.

390
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,693
It could be Kovar, it can be your wife,
it can be your child,

391
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,857
but I need you to choose
and do it quickly.

392
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,025
Kovar is very paranoid. Careful.

393
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,286
We never meet in person, only remotely.

394
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,822
Remotely how?

395
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,082
- A digital dead drop. The dark web.
- What's the IP address?

396
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,837
What is the IP address?

397
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,499
108.166.7.161.

398
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,384
If this information is incorrect,
your family will suffer.

399
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,966
How does an American become this?

400
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,972
This...

401
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,889
- Bratva devil.
- I don't know.

402
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,004
About time, blondie. Can we go now?

403
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,466
First of all, not my name. Second, were
you able to locate Church on your recon?

404
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,381
No, but street cams actually picked
him up, so we know he's on the move.

405
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,424
We just don't know where he's moving to.

406
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,060
<i>We can't go after Church
without knowing his endgame first.</i>

407
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,187
Sounds like an excuse to sit around
and do nothing.

408
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,644
- What are you doing?
- Not nothing.

409
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:44,358
You're cross-plotting Church's prior
locations into a projection algorithm.

410
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,023
You probably got beat up
in grade school a lot.

411
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,025
- And junior high.
- Okay, based on Church's route,

412
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,662
I'm calculating an 86% likelihood
he's going to 18 Mill Road.

413
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,700
- Why does that sound so familiar?
- Because we were just there.

414
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,038
To hand over Sergio.

415
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,377
It's where the ACU is bunkered.
Church is going to take them out.

416
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,435
Montes, quit screwing around.

417
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,400
Station Chief, this is Gans in Cell
Block C. We have a code yellow situation.

418
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,410
Initiate immediate lockdown,
have all prisoners return to their cells.

419
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,118
I'm not rolling on Church.

420
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,578
You think you scare me more than him?

421
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,830
Hmm.

422
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,587
No.

423
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,761
But he's not here with you.

424
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,598
Lam.

425
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,098
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.

426
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,393
Nah, haven't you heard?

427
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,278
All of the justice in this city
comes from vigilantes.

428
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,161
Word on the street is,
is that Church is planning something.

429
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,199
Something big.

430
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,167
You tell me what it is, then he'll be
the one in those cuffs instead of you.

431
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:28,174
You're talking about the Trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.

432
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,090
Can't even come close.

433
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:39,677
What the hell's going on? Church?

434
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,477
At least we definitely know
where Church is now.

435
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,817
D'Angelo is right. We gotta put him down.

436
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,779
Against that? Without Oliver?
No, we're short-handed as it is.

437
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,694
- You scared?
- No.

438
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,537
But I'm not stupid either.

439
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,993
Evie's right. I'm not sending you
out there just to get slaughtered.

440
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,328
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

441
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,034
You saw what you're up against, okay?

442
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,996
This isn't some drill where you take down
a petty thug or a drug dealer.

443
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,541
This is real. And with real stakes.
The three of you could die out there.

444
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,836
<i>That's something we get to decide
for ourselves, isn't it?</i>

445
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:18,508
I mean, I don't know about everyone else,
but I didn't join this team to stay safe.

446
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,935
Okay, why don't we take a vote?

447
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,517
- All those in favor...
- We're all gonna say yes, blondie.

448
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:29,067
God. Not my name!
Good. Okay. Go. Do not die.

449
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,444
<i>Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.</i>

450
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:42,577
<i>Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.</i>

451
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,257
- Hey, John. What's new?
- I'm not doing this. I told Lyla.

452
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,889
Yeah. You can yell at us later,
but right now we're on a bit of a clock.

453
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,721
Are you even hearing me, right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.

454
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,806
The MPs going to do a count
in a few minutes. My guess

455
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,937
is there're only expecting
to find one person in here.

456
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,315
Really? So that's your plan? Blackmail?

457
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,567
Do what you say
or you get caught in here too?

458
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,354
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.

459
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,444
Oliver, I killed my brother.

460
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,443
I went to the Army to change,
and I haven't changed.

461
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,078
I know, all right?

462
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,239
And I know that you think
this is your penance for that...

463
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,750
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.

464
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,703
Even when you told me not to.
I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.

465
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,124
I need you. The team needs you.
The city needs you.

466
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm not saying you shouldn't do
your penance. You probably should.

467
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,966
But do it as Spartan.

468
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,597
What's in the box?

469
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,307
It's an anti-molecular compound,
and theoretically,

470
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,851
it should eat through anything.

471
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm not going to ask
how you got your hands on this.

472
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:00,610
Hey, you came back for me,
even against my wishes.

473
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,453
I guess I haven't changed
that much either.

474
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,621
Maybe that's what I have to do
my penance for.

475
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,585
That toy of yours is definitely coming
in handy.

476
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,096
Project that Lyla's been keeping
an eye on for A.R.G.U.S.

477
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,756
Should have known
that she'd be helping out.

478
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,472
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.

479
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,682
<i>Follow the sublevel north for
200 meters... </i>

480
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,266
<i>...then climb up.</i>

481
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,776
- What is it?
- Comms are being jammed.

482
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,569
Go! Go! Go!

483
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,238
Hey, is there another way out of here?

484
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,861
You mind uncuffing me
before they kill you?

485
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,493
Hey.

486
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,971
Hey. If that's for taking out the wall,

487
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,383
the blast will kill us
before we can get out. We're in too tight.

488
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,849
- Trust me.
- Yeah. Says the creepy-looking...

489
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,389
- What the hell are you, anyways?
- I'm in place. Blow it.

490
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,037
Sorry we blew up your building. Come on!

491
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,879
- We're goin' up.
- Then what?

492
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,270
Which way, Overwatch?

493
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,735
Take a right at the end of that hallway,
it should be a fire exit.

494
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,572
You through there, you're home free. Easy.

495
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,329
Not so easy.

496
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,243
Rag! Cover me.

497
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,254
Go, go: go'

498
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,929
Let's go!

499
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,225
- It's okay.
- Help me get him up.

500
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,984
Come on.

501
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,866
I probably should just shoot you, but...

502
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,945
But you've earned a little suffering.

503
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,248
- Get him to safety.
- But...

504
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,412
- Go!
- Come on.

505
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,063
Hey, don't kill him.

506
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,113
He may have his uses.

507
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,988
- We've to go back for Wild Dog
- Copy. Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.

508
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,154
- We could use some help.
- Inbound. Hold on.

509
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,240
Get in!

510
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,790
- Where's the Wild Dog kid?
- Still inside. Fighting Church.

511
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,079
We've gotta go back for him.

512
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,248
No, unless you all want to die,
we to go now. Now!

513
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,667
We can't just leave him!

514
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,961
- You have to. Go.
- Come on!

515
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,012
- Here.
- What's this?

516
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,892
Put it on.

517
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,389
Let's go.

518
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,363
Digg, your harness.

519
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,698
You two, freeze!

520
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,535
Down on the ground.
Lace your fingers behind your head!

521
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,994
<i>Do it now or we will shoot.</i>

522
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,709
John, don't move.

523
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,228
This place should keep you off the grid
for the time being.

524
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,266
- Until we find a permanent solution.
- Hey, first things first...

525
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,559
Mmm.

526
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,233
I can't believe you broke me
out of prison.

527
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,239
- For better or worse, Johnny.
- Told you I want to stay.

528
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,693
And I figured if you wanted
to make your own decisions,

529
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,327
then you wouldn't have gotten married.

530
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,716
Okay. How mad was Felicity
that you went along with this?

531
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,588
How do you know
she thought it was a bad idea?

532
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,636
I know Felicity.

533
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,258
What's wrong?

534
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,348
- I have to go.
- Hey.

535
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,606
When you said you haven't changed?

536
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:25,934
Don't.

537
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,619
How was first night in Russian prison?

538
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,253
Friedkin gave up the dead drop and now
he's dead. Mission accomplished.

539
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:53,303
- You are being sarcasm, yes?
- That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.

540
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,302
He didn't deserve to die.

541
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,842
In Bratva, there is no death
without purpose.

542
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,808
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar,

543
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,815
his information not so good.

544
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,148
You know, maybe you could have explained
that to me before you sent me in there.

545
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,859
I almost didn't kill him.

546
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,949
But you did. Why?

547
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,989
Because you told me to.

548
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,658
You trust us.

549
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,585
Now we trust you.

550
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,588
Third test over.

551
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,583
You get it?

552
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,883
You are Bratva now. Family.

553
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:56,192
Last handful of honest cops in the city
and Church nearly took 'em out.

554
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,156
- Along with me.
- We're just glad you're all right.

555
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,038
I've gotta be thinking
this is a PR nightmare,

556
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,825
something like this going down
and the Mayor's MIA.

557
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,665
Look, he called in this morning.

558
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,505
His health problems are almost over.

559
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,211
That's good news.

560
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,967
We're hearing that one of
the, uh, vigilantes

561
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,130
who was part of the rescue,
that he didn't make it out.

562
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,093
- Um, any word on him?
- CSU hasn't found a body, so...

563
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,849
So Church has him.

564
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,557
I've spent most of my life thinking
that men in masks

565
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,772
were only capable of doing
horrible things.

566
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,022
I may have to reevaluate that.

567
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,567
- Let me know when Queen gets in.
- Will do.

568
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,951
Are you all right?

569
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,583
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
I barely knew the kid, Thea.

570
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,915
Well, doesn't make it sting any less.

571
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,212
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is easy.

572
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,422
I mean, cold as that sounds.

573
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,007
Look, I know why you're asking, okay?
And I'm... I'm fine.

574
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,929
Okay.

575
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,099
I mean, I'm just saying.

576
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,107
If things ever get less easy,

577
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,477
you know I'm here for you, right?

578
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,903
Noted.

579
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,147
And appreciated.

580
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,358
Okay.

581
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,288
What is the point of having
keyhole satellite imagery

582
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,994
if you can't use it to find anybody?

583
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,036
Feel like I don't understand half
the sentences you say.

584
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:36,049
What I'm saying is that no matter how
hard I try, I cannot find Rene anywhere.

585
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,553
I was the one who told you guys
to leave him behind.

586
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,849
Sounds like another impossible decision.

587
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,972
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better
at making them?

588
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,227
I'm saying you were right.

589
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,937
If we're going to do this,
we can't let guilt swallow us up.

590
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,273
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise
the same for me.

591
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,534
Deal.

592
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,781
Ow.

593
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,993
Ow. Ow.

594
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,164
So, "Ow," then?

595
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,630
Things have really fallen apart
without Oliver, haven't they?

596
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,168
It's a good thing I'm back, then.

597
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,555
Was he waiting for an entrance line?

598
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,841
Nope. He's just that cool.

599
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,636
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?

600
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,846
You get John?

601
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,226
Yeah. He's fine. He's holed up at HIVE.

602
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,528
I couldn't write him off.

603
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,363
And we are not gonna write off Rene.

604
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,028
We're gonna find him.
We're gonna bring him back.

605
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,325
Wherever he is.

606
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,372
Ah.

607
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,837
Wakey, wakey.

608
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,432
Hey, hell. Man.

609
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,560
Been a long time
since I've been tagged like this.

610
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,975
- Respect.
- Oh, my pleasure.

611
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,769
But I promise you, if you untie me,

612
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,855
I'll show you a hell of a lot
more than respect.

613
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,405
Ooh, man, you've got spirit
and I am duly impressed.

614
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,900
But I'm gonna break that spirit.

615
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,577
I'm gonna break your soul.

616
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,916
And when we're finished,
assuming that you're still alive...

617
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,374
Now, I wouldn't bet
no money on that, though,

618
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,461
there's gonna be very little of you left
for the Green Arrow to work with.

619
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,260
Light him up.
