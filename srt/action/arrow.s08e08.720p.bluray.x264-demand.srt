1
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:05,298
<i>Previously on "Crisis
on Infinite Earths"...</i>

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,634
There's a wave
of antimatter sweeping

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,052
across this universe,

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,929
destroying everything
in its path.

5
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,232
He fought to his last breath

6
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,943
knowing every moment
was another life saved.

7
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,945
Dig, we are working
on bringing him back

8
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,988
the same way that he
brought me back, remember?

9
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,591
You're talking about a trip
to Purgatory?

10
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:32,450
- Yes.
<i>- Fine. Count me in.</i>

11
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,160
I need you
to come back to us.

12
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:36,162
You're my brother.
Can't lose you, man.

13
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,413
Oliver Queen.

14
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:39,582
- Who are you?
- Jim Corrigan,

15
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,209
but I'm also a Spectre.

16
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,121
It's your turn now.

17
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:46,130
Only you can light
the spark, Oliver.

18
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,382
It is your destiny.

19
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,267
What's happening?

20
00:00:58,393 --> 00:00:59,435
Iris!

21
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:04,857
Where are we?

22
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,776
This is
the vanishing point.

23
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,862
It's a point outside
of time and space.

24
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,616
- Something's wrong.
- No. Hey, hey.

25
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:21,708
What did you do?

26
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,377
Well, I held
The Book of Destiny,

27
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:29,132
and I thought destiny
could use a little rewrite.

28
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,549
What do we do now?

29
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,356
Are we ready?

30
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,523
Just about.

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,736
You better suit up.

32
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,665
I love you.

33
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,626
I love you.

34
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,432
Okay. This will be
temporal jump trial one.

35
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,142
All systems nominal.

36
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,853
I look ridiculous.

37
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,815
Is this really the height of fashion
at the dawn of time?

38
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,984
The suit provides
a shield against...

39
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,361
the coronal radiation...

40
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,321
my body will be...
yes, yes, yes.

41
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,883
I'm familiar with the jingle,

42
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,384
but you couldn't have
designed something

43
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,702
a tad less... bulky?

44
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,581
Remind me again,
why did I marry you?

45
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:46,376
You have a thing for men
of towering ambition.

46
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,421
Are you seeing this
quantum flux cascade?

47
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,091
I am just a time traveler
here, my love.

48
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,176
You are the Monitor.

49
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:03,267
Engaging quantum portal.

50
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:05,895
Field is stabilizing.

51
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,482
The portal is engaging.

52
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:14,612
Next stop...
the dawn of time.

53
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,421
I am in the temporal zone.

54
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,718
Oh, I wish you could
see this, Xneen.

55
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,905
<i>The birthplace of all creation.</i>

56
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,140
<i>It is beautiful.</i>

57
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,520
Mar, I'm getting readings
here I don't understand.

58
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,447
Your presence has
corrupted the zone somehow.

59
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,275
It's... it's releasing radiation
I've never seen before.

60
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:56,446
<i>I think...
I think this might be anti-matter.</i>

61
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,073
You have to get out of there.

62
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,033
Get out of there
right now!

63
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,520
<i>Xneen... Xneen,</i>

64
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:12,544
<i>can you hear me?</i>

65
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,922
Something went wrong.

66
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,134
I do not think this is
the dawn of time.

67
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,178
<i>No, it is.</i>

68
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,055
It just isn't the dawn of time
of our universe.

69
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:24,806
What?

70
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,310
You breached the wall
between our universe

71
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,561
and its opposite.

72
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,773
An anti-universe?

73
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,692
<i>Your body
was suffused with coronal radiation.</i>

74
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,527
The suit couldn't
contain it.

75
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:43,117
Mar? Mar, can you
hear me?

76
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,763
<i>I'm sorry, my love.</i>

77
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,705
My towering ambition...

78
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,708
has doomed us all.

79
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,145
<i>Dear Amanda,</i>

80
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,482
<i>so... you're dead</i>

81
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,319
<i>along with, well, everyone,</i>

82
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:23,616
<i>everyone who's ever lived
in any reality ever,</i>

83
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:28,454
<i>and me, I'm supposed
to be a Paragon,</i>

84
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,457
<i>one of seven people who are
supposed to be</i>

85
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,627
<i>the multiverse's
last, best chance.</i>

86
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,255
<i>I don't see it.</i>

87
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:41,592
<i>The so-called
Paragon of Destiny,</i>

88
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,513
<i>she doesn't even believe
in tomorrow anymore.</i>

89
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,476
<i>The Paragon of Courage
spends every day</i>

90
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,019
<i>working herself to the bone,</i>

91
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,190
<i>training for a fight
that will never come.</i>

92
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,904
<i>The Paragon of Honor
just meditates</i>

93
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,115
<i>for hours on end.</i>

94
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,495
<i>The Paragon of Hope</i>

95
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,290
<i>has lost hers...</i>

96
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,922
<i>and me, I spend my days
trying to repurpose</i>

97
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,591
<i>the broken technology
of this place</i>

98
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,757
<i>to find us a way out.</i>

99
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:23,885
Careful, careful.

100
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,237
<i>Narcissist,</i>

101
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,263
<i>sociopath, evil genius...</i>

102
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,603
<i>there are a lot of ways
to describe Lex Luthor.</i>

103
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,393
Agh! Idiot!

104
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,413
Why couldn't I be trapped
at the edge of eternity

105
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,772
with someone possessing more
than 200 IQ points?

106
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,193
<i>But I find
"douchebag" to be the most descriptive.</i>

107
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,031
<i>As for Barry Allen,
aka the Flash,</i>

108
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:49,535
<i>aka the Paragon of Love,
he's just gone.</i>

109
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,203
<i>Missing.</i>

110
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,920
What, you guys
building modern art now?

111
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,880
Hey, team.
We're repurposing

112
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,757
leftover time masters tech.

113
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,634
Mr. Luthor and I think
we've retrofitted it

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,968
into a teleportation
device.

115
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,722
To teleport us
to where exactly?

116
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,557
Kate makes a good point.

117
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,894
There is no... there
out there anymore.

118
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,647
So we send
somebody to test it.

119
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,108
- I'll go.
- No.

120
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,277
We've lost too many
good people already.

121
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,279
Thanks for
volunteering, Lex.

122
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,658
Well, that's very cold.

123
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,244
Is it because I killed
your parallel reality cousin?

124
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:33,828
Start it up.

125
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,799
If this works...

126
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,550
We get
out of here,

127
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,469
we defeat
the Anti-Monitor,

128
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,597
and we find a way
to get all the people we lost back.

129
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,947
Perhaps it was
too much to hope for.

130
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:09,824
Is there some way
you can get it to work?

131
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,971
It was a longshot
to begin with.

132
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,037
Watch out!

133
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,918
- Barry!
- Ugh!

134
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,295
Where am I?
Where am I?

135
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,171
The Vanishing Point.

136
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,382
You've been gone
for months.

137
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,151
What are you... what
are you talking about?

138
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,593
I just left
two seconds ago.

139
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,344
To go where?

140
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,264
To the speed force.
I didn't...

141
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,392
I couldn't... it was like...

142
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,025
it was like running
into a mountain at mach 10.

143
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,187
I couldn't...

144
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,068
there's no way
out of here.

145
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:21,061
What did you see?

146
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,604
Everything.

147
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,233
I see everything now.

148
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,568
Then you're ready.

149
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,821
Why would you make me
relive all that?

150
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,742
Every fight, every punch
you've thrown,

151
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,285
every kick
you've landed,

152
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,621
every arrow you've fired,
they have all led you here

153
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,665
to this moment,
to the ultimate fight.

154
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,666
Who am I fighting?

155
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:44,959
Not who.

156
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,045
What.

157
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,131
The Anti-Monitor.

158
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,237
The Monitor's adversary.

159
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,429
Not just adversary.

160
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,266
A being who stands against all there
ever was or will be,

161
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,645
the apocalypse itself
given life and form

162
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,105
and terrible purpose.

163
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,564
How do I beat him?

164
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:06,731
With help.

165
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,485
It's time to get your friends.

166
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,696
Barry, wait.
You look spent. You need to rest.

167
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,990
No. I'm fine.
I have to try again.

168
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,046
Hey, Barry,
that's a bad idea, okay?

169
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,386
The effort alone
could kill you.

170
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,829
It's better than just
staying here.

171
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,264
We're not gonna let
you kill yourself.

172
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,288
Get out of my way!

173
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,059
- Barry!
- We're not letting you

174
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,084
go anywhere.

175
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,878
- So try and stop me!
- In the condition you're in, Barry,

176
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,922
- it's not gonna be that hard.
- Cut it out!

177
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,422
Whatever's going to happen is not
going to include us turning on each other.

178
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,096
M-maybe you're right.
Maybe the speed force

179
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,806
is our last, best hope.

180
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,093
It is.

181
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,811
The speed force is
the key to saving you.

182
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,275
It's the key to
saving everyone.

183
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,703
Oliver?

184
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,497
Yes and no.

185
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,292
It's complicated.

186
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,877
Nice outfit.

187
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,546
Very... Sith.

188
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:13,924
Oliver?

189
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,843
I am Oliver Queen,

190
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,137
but I'm also
something more.

191
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,430
More what?

192
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,016
Some might call me a ghost,

193
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,059
a Spectre...

194
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,188
that's in tune with the entire
multiverse.

195
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,748
So there's still
a multiverse out there?

196
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,024
No. It's gone,

197
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,776
replaced with
its antithesis.

198
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,403
An anti-matter
universe.

199
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,238
Which we need to prevent
from happening.

200
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,449
Right now,
the Anti-Monitor

201
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,867
is at the dawn
of time,

202
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,746
fighting to make permanent
his destruction of worlds.

203
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,166
Then we go there,
and we end him.

204
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,043
He's
extremely powerful.

205
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,128
The eight of us might
not be enough.

206
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,881
We need
a backup plan.

207
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,424
You have our attention.

208
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,469
Several millennia ago
on a planet named Maltus,

209
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,722
Mar Novu attempted to travel
to the birth of the universe

210
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,809
but instead... opened a breach
to the anti-matter universe.

211
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,687
So the Monitor
gave us the Anti-Monitor.

212
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,773
Correct.
So while some of us

213
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,524
fight at the dawn
of time,

214
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,777
others must go
to Maltus.

215
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,987
And prevent Novu from
freeing his doppelganger?

216
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,321
I'm in.

217
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,242
Travel to an alien world?
So in.

218
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,407
Same.

219
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,827
Come on. You know you
don't want to risk

220
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,038
letting me out of your
sight for even a millisecond.

221
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,350
We can get to both
through the speed force,

222
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,292
but I can't get
into the speed force right now.

223
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,420
It's probably because
there's no multiverse left,

224
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,067
but you said you're in tune
with the multiverse.

225
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,509
Does that include
the speed force?

226
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,844
What you're asking me
is very dangerous, Barry.

227
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,096
But possible.

228
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,307
You could give me
the energy boost I need.

229
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,058
Please.

230
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,938
We have to do this.
Everyone's lives depend on it.

231
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,742
I've unlocked
your potential, Barry.

232
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,036
By touching my head?

233
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,038
Use this power
with caution.

234
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,916
Do you trust me?

235
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,628
Are you Oliver Queen?

236
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,213
Yes.

237
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,260
Then I trust you
with every cell of my body.

238
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,348
Good. Now run, Barry.

239
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:29,810
Run.

240
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,915
Okay.

241
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,834
Thanks for the kind
assist.

242
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,670
Why doesn't this
alien forest look more alien?

243
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,840
Let's focus. Mar Novu
could be anywhere,

244
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,801
and it's not like we can
just do an internet search for him.

245
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,172
Well, actually,
maybe we can.

246
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,554
Look at that.

247
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,892
Any city that large
has to be a bureaucracy.

248
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
And?

249
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,105
Well, bureaucracies
require some form

250
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,565
of central data bank
to function.

251
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,986
We find that,
we find Novu.

252
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,365
That's actually not
a bad idea. Lex...

253
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,409
Where's Lex?

254
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,974
<i>Sorry I'm late,</i>

255
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,683
<i>but actually
my train was late.</i>

256
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,769
<i>Well, the second one.
The first one I did miss,</i>

257
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,479
<i>but that was
my cab driver's fault.</i>

258
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:59,108
<i>I've got this great traffic app,
and he thought that...</i>

259
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,026
Queen consolidated?

260
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:02,903
Not exactly.

261
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,489
You're in
the speed force, Barry.

262
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,908
What happened to you?
You're not...

263
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,701
spectrey anymore.

264
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,579
Oh. Well, I'm lost.

265
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,749
I'm out there somewhere
in the speed force, too.

266
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,879
Right. The Anti-Monitor attacked.

267
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,382
We were separated,
and I am utilizing

268
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,927
various pieces
of my essence

269
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,598
to keep me, Sara,
J'onn, and Kate together.

270
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,017
That's why I'm here.
This is...

271
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,270
this is where we
first met.

272
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,982
There are few things
more powerful in the universe

273
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,025
than memory
and connection.

274
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:46,113
I am using our memories
of our friends

275
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,573
and closest allies

276
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,576
to keep all of us from falling out
of the speed force.

277
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,536
Wait. What happens
if they fall out?

278
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,371
We'll be consumed
by anti-matter.

279
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,458
I can buy you time, Barry,

280
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,503
but... you need to get
to each of us.

281
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,297
I mean, the speed force
is infinite.

282
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,066
I-I could never know
where to begin to look.

283
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,259
Remember, Barry,
memories and connections.

284
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,970
You need to consider
our greatest victories,

285
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,389
our most crushing defeats,

286
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,477
the moments when the bonds
between us were forged.

287
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,395
When the bonds were forged.

288
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,148
Now do this, Barry.

289
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,402
Because you have to.

290
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,952
What the...?

291
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,996
Um, hello?

292
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,376
What the hell is this?

293
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:47,049
I'm asking myself
the same question... literally.

294
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,699
No. This... this
can't be happening.

295
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,719
This... you... what are
you doing here?

296
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,639
Well, I'll tell you that
when you tell me

297
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:57,726
where... here... is.

298
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,979
Is this cosplay?
Oh, do you want a selfie, bro?

299
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,065
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. We're not... no.

300
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:06,401
I'm also the Flash.

301
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,568
You're also the what?

302
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,406
- The Flash?
- The Flash?

303
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,578
- The Flash.
- It's complicated.

304
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:21,041
- I like your outfit. It seems... comfy.
- I was thinking yours is pretty cool.

305
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,709
- Smooth.
- Seems safe and...

306
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,876
it's breathable.

307
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:27,797
I'm Barry Allen.

308
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,550
- No!
- What?

309
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,426
What does that mean?
How can this...

310
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,011
This should be
impossible now.

311
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,178
Should be impossible now?

312
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,765
You don't know
about the...

313
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:37,951
Oh, my God.
Don't do this to me.

314
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,055
I don't know
about the what?

315
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,783
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

316
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,607
I told Victor this was possible.

317
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,669
What does this mean?

318
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:00,765
What do you think
you're doing?

319
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,058
What you should
have done the moment

320
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,362
Fleet Feet dropped us
off here...

321
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,252
checked out the lay
of the land,

322
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,004
looked for
hidden dangers.

323
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,714
We are on an alien world.

324
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,400
Any number of chest busters
or predators could be lying in wait.

325
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,926
Don't you capes ever
watch a movie?

326
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,893
You know what?
Whatever it is you're planning,

327
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,555
I'm gonna figure
it out, and...

328
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,432
I'm gonna stop you.

329
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,349
I doubt that.

330
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,061
In a contest of mind over muscle,
mind wins every time,

331
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,730
but here.

332
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,125
Let me make it
easy for you.

333
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,360
Ask me what I'm
up to.

334
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,195
Go ahead.

335
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,576
All right.
What are you up to, Lex?

336
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,661
Universal domination,
of course.

337
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,127
Oh, I probably
should have mentioned

338
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,670
that I gave myself
a few upgrades

339
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,089
when I checked
The Book of Destiny out of the library.

340
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,507
What are you
doing?

341
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,111
God, I am so tired
of answering that question.

342
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,059
Moving on.

343
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,160
<i>Yeah.
The Black Canary.</i>

344
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,205
<i>She tried to shut me up,
but it's not gonna work.</i>

345
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,831
I didn't
kill those people.

346
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,042
Yes, I know.
Felicity told me.

347
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,960
An impersonator, right?

348
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,212
Hate when that happens.

349
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,548
Five years on
a deserted island.

350
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,760
That kind of thing
really changes you, doesn't it?

351
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,805
Must have been difficult
if not impossible

352
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,140
to hold on to your sanity
all those years,

353
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,225
and here you are,

354
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,604
pretending you have
everything in control.

355
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,942
Felicity told you
the truth,

356
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,820
and you should trust
her judgment.

357
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:56,904
How can I do that?

358
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,574
Her perception of you
is clearly clouded

359
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,868
by her emotional
attachment.

360
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,372
She's not seeing you
for what you really are.

361
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,712
You have no idea
what this city is up against.

362
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,630
Actually, I think I do,

363
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,841
and I'm gonna
stop him.

364
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,427
Who are you?

365
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,160
I want to limit
your involvement in this.

366
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,311
Why? Because I'm an alien?

367
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,397
I also happen to be
your biggest weapon.

368
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,607
You're an unknown quantity,
and this isn't personal.

369
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,484
Except that's exactly
how this feels.

370
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,404
When I... when I started
living this life,

371
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,614
I was going up
against human threats alone,

372
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,781
and I could handle that.

373
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:41,907
Then there were metahumans,

374
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:42,909
and I could
handle that.

375
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,346
I just discovered that
there are multiple Earths,

376
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,539
and I was brainwashed
aboard an alien spacecraft.

377
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,874
I'm sure that
was unnerving.

378
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,376
I don't get unnerved.
When I go up against something new,

379
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,543
I push back.

380
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,588
Right or wrong,
it's who I am,

381
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,715
and it's what I do,
so I am asking you

382
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,258
for just a little
bit of space

383
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,386
so that I can draw
a line somewhere,

384
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,474
so that I can claw back
just a small sense of normalcy.

385
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,185
I'm afraid we're well past normal.

386
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,773
J'onn, what are you doing here?

387
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,610
That... is a very long story.

388
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:28,871
Supergirl?!

389
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,334
Supergirl, please
wake up.

390
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:34,920
- Hey.
- Ryan?

391
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,799
Yeah. I think Lex
pulled a Luthor on us.

392
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:41,593
On the bright side,

393
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,238
I've never been knocked unconscious
on an alien planet before.

394
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,782
It's pretty much the same as
being knocked unconscious on Earth.

395
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,519
No broken bones.
You'll be fine.

396
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,815
Thanks. This definitely
makes me question again why I'm here.

397
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,984
I haven't got
special powers

398
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,111
or, you know, powers.

399
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,730
I'm pretty much
the dictionary definition of unspecial,

400
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,284
and I definitely don't feel like
I'm a Paragon of anything,

401
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,744
let alone Humanity.

402
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Hey... wait.

403
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,667
Are you sure you guys
got the right guy?

404
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,837
You left your family
because someone

405
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,089
you never even met told you
you were needed.

406
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,153
I'd say that makes you
pretty special.

407
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,511
I don't know
about hope,

408
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,557
but you're definitely
the Paragon of Pep Talks.

409
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,560
Years of practice.
We need to catch up to Lex.

410
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,871
How do you know
where he's headed?

411
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,188
Well, before he
knocked me out,

412
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,816
he said was looking for
universal domination, so...

413
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,818
Hardly sounds like
a newsflash.

414
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,529
The universal part is new,
but if I know him,

415
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,240
he's looking to mess with
Novu's experiment,

416
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,576
change history to his advantage.

417
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,121
He really is a selfish asshat,
isn't he?

418
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,622
You really have
no idea.

419
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What are you doing?

420
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,004
I'm guessing you haven't
flown on an alien planet either.

421
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,507
- I've never flown.
- No, but it's okay, Dr. Choi.

422
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,693
You don't have
to be nervous.

423
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,845
It's just up, up,
and away.

424
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:11,807
It's over, Deegan!

425
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,311
No. I decide
when the story ends!

426
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,355
Come on, Oliver.
Where are you?

427
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,372
Agh!

428
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,251
I wasn't here for this.

429
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,926
Told you you'd
catch me.

430
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:51,640
Thanks for the save.

431
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,433
With a magic arrow,
no less.

432
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,185
It's a gift
from the Monitor.

433
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,648
- Barry?
- Hey.

434
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,108
Did you go out shopping
for a new costume

435
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,170
while you were supposed
to be out saving the world?

436
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,196
What? Uh, no. No.

437
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,049
I-it's a crazy, long story,
and you wouldn't

438
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,073
believe me if I told you.

439
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,284
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

440
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,663
Please. Excuse us.

441
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:17,874
Are you okay?

442
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,836
What I'm about to tell you
isn't gonna make any sense,

443
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:26,174
but... you're not really
h-here right now.

444
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,134
- You're actually...
- In the speed force.

445
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,640
I remember. I...

446
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:37,894
I remember everything.

447
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,522
Okay. Well,
in that case...

448
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,694
that arrow...
from the Monitor,

449
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,531
I always felt like
there was something

450
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:50,699
you weren't telling me.

451
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,996
I didn't want to burden
you with the choice I made.

452
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,039
The choice to do what?

453
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,042
You and Kara, Barry,

454
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,505
you were fated to die
trying to save the world.

455
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,219
Right before you died,

456
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:15,348
you said you'd given up everything
for me and Kara.

457
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,685
You made some kind
of devil's bargain

458
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,412
with the Monitor to save us,
didn't you?

459
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,022
No. It wasn't
a devil's bargain, Barry,

460
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,190
and I'd make it again
in a second.

461
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,192
It cost you
your family, Oliver.

462
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,193
Cost you your life.

463
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,280
Dying's the easy part.

464
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,742
The dead are at peace,

465
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,549
but the real heroes are the ones

466
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,163
who have to keep going.

467
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,667
Go find the others.

468
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:58,182
Laurel.

469
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,563
Laurel, it's time.
It's time to put her to rest.

470
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,941
What am I supposed to tell my parents?

471
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,862
My father, he...
he has a bad heart.

472
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,669
He won't live through this.

473
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,164
It should have been me.

474
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,459
She was
the true hero.

475
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,255
A hero sets
an example, Laurel...

476
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,717
so follow hers.

477
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,678
Wear the mask.

478
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,306
Be the Canary.

479
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,476
That's how you keep
your sister alive.

480
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,278
Oh, boy.

481
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,501
Engaging quantum portal.

482
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,669
I wouldn't do that.

483
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,545
Xneen?

484
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,214
No.

485
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,343
No, obviously.

486
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,428
Hi. Lex Luthor.

487
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm here to make you an offer
I won't let you refuse.

488
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,850
How did you get in here?

489
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,685
Our security
protocols are...

490
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:24,852
A joke,

491
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,730
but the fact that I was able
to circumvent them with astonishing ease

492
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,649
is exactly why you need
to listen to me.

493
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,360
- Xneen?
- Is taking a little nappy time.

494
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,527
Not to worry.

495
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:36,906
So you are a scientist.

496
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,368
Tell me you're not intrigued
by what I have to say,

497
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,830
or do you get regular visits
from humans with future knowledge?

498
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:46,915
Speak.

499
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:48,960
The experiment
you're conducting

500
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,753
will not only
destroy you

501
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,173
but your planet
and your wife.

502
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,384
Another ancient zealot.
I am so sick...

503
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,467
Don't know
who they are.

504
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,696
I'm not even
from this universe.

505
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,221
What I am from
is the future,

506
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:04,434
so I know exactly how your little
time-jumping experiment will go wrong,

507
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:09,397
and I am willing to share
my future knowledge with you.

508
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,481
And in return?

509
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,485
Well, I don't cotton
to aliens,

510
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:18,072
but you will soon have
certain abilities

511
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,617
that I will need in order
to deal with some,

512
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:24,078
shall we say,
super problems

513
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,830
popping up
in my world.

514
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:29,751
I do not have
any... abilities.

515
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:31,878
Stick with me, kid.

516
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,380
So what do you say?
Team up?

517
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,132
The brave and the bald?

518
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,803
Who are you?

519
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:47,060
Hey. Um, this is awkward.

520
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:51,564
Long story short,
you guys aren't really you guys,

521
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,360
and none of this is
really actually happening.

522
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,445
What are you talk... hey! Hey!

523
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:58,655
Don't you touch her!

524
00:28:58,821 --> 00:28:59,739
I'm so sorry.

525
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,703
It's a miracle.

526
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,248
- Barry?
- Hey.

527
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,750
- What's happening?
- It's a long, very weird story.

528
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,086
- I'll catch you up on the way.
- On the way to where?

529
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,438
You're not taking
her anywhere.

530
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,463
I'm sorry.
Like I said,

531
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,966
you guys aren't really here.

532
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:21,970
The speed force?

533
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,496
I can only assume.

534
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,408
We were moving through the speed force
when we were attacked.

535
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,826
Uh, by someone called...

536
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,893
The Anti-Monitor.

537
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,770
Doesn't even sound like
an actual name.

538
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,460
We're all trying to stop him.

539
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,065
We're working together.

540
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,946
The two of you...
work together.

541
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,170
I know you don't trust each other.

542
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,951
Right now, I know you
don't even like each other,

543
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,579
but all that changes.

544
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,293
In fact, we all come
to depend on each other.

545
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,212
We all come to
trust each other.

546
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,299
Why are you telling us this now?

547
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,430
This seems to be a pattern with you.

548
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,309
You don't trust people.
They don't trust you.

549
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,186
Then all
of that changes,

550
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,794
and the bond
between you is stronger than iron.

551
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,776
I'm sorry.
What's your point?

552
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,822
It's maybe something
I can learn from.

553
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,891
So basically, you tore
a little hole

554
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,411
in the space-time
continuum,

555
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,181
opened a doorway into something
called the anti-matter universe.

556
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,833
Matter and anti-matter
cannot coexist.

557
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,686
Hence a lot of bad stuff
happening that we would

558
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,961
just as soon not
have happen,

559
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:40,465
so I think what we need to do is adjust
the Ronstrom coefficient.

560
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,262
Lex, we need to talk.

561
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:58,107
Mar Novu, do not trust
this man with anything!

562
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:59,434
Give him a knife
for his food,

563
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,211
and no matter how much
he thanks you for the dinner,

564
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,835
he'll stab you right
in the back with it.

565
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,447
Or the front.
I'm not choosy.

566
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,115
Last time, you caught me
by surprise.

567
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,617
That's not gonna
happen again.

568
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,951
Get Novu outta here.

569
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,870
Come with me,
sir, please.

570
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,086
Xneen!

571
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:22,715
Okay. Listen to me.

572
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,343
Whatever you do,
you can't open that portal.

573
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,178
The hairless one
warned me.

574
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,514
No. This isn't
a warning kind of situation.

575
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,767
This is a don't do it
at any... cost kind of situation.

576
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:33,976
It is my life's work.

577
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,146
Trillions of other
people's lives,

578
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,023
an infinite number,

579
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,275
will be lost if you go
through with it.

580
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:43,652
It's not worth it.

581
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:46,489
You just show up here
as if by magic

582
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,282
and demand belief.

583
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,911
The fact I'm here at all
should be enough to convince you.

584
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:57,542
You are a remarkable
individual.

585
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,673
Funny. A new friend
of mine just told me I'm special.

586
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,511
I didn't believe
her until now.

587
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:17,437
I wonder, is it
a double-cross

588
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,522
if I never trusted you
in the first place?

589
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,859
Why do you Kryptonians always
have to take things so personally?

590
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,277
You tried to kill
my cousin,

591
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,736
you tried to kill me,

592
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,113
you betrayed Lena,

593
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,866
left her with nothing
but a ruined name and a broken heart.

594
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,705
All I did was tell
her the truth,

595
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,999
something you never had
the courage to do.

596
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,251
Don't take it personally.

597
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,428
Hey! If you would stop trying
to kill each other.

598
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,221
I got through to Novu.

599
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,141
You just ruined
a perfectly good bad guy plan,

600
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,309
you know that,
new guy?

601
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,110
Where are we?

602
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,488
The anti-matter
universe.

603
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,072
At the dawn of time.

604
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,719
We arrived, and he was
already here...

605
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,242
the Anti-Monitor.

606
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:17,246
That's impossible.
I got through to him. I know I did.

607
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,500
Some fates are inescapable.

608
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,213
You spoke to one man
across countless universes,

609
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:27,924
but within the tapestry
of the multiverse,

610
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,510
there will always be
one Mar Novu

611
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,179
who cannot turn
from his towering ambition,

612
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,433
and in that inevitability,
there is destiny.

613
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,020
Welcome to mine!

614
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,682
All of you,

615
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,156
listen to me.

616
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,788
This is why you were selected.
You're Paragons.

617
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:01,141
Yeah. I'm still a little unclear
on what all that means.

618
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,725
It means you're
powerful enough

619
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,043
to hold the line,

620
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,462
to buy us the time we need.

621
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:07,629
To do what?

622
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,674
Rebirth the universe.

623
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,010
What, like, a do-over?

624
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,721
The dawn of time is
the only place it can happen.

625
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:20,393
I'll light the spark,
you fan the flame.

626
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
And how do we do that?

627
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,062
You'll know when it's time.

628
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,481
Why do you cosmic types
always have to be so obtuse?

629
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:26,941
If I knew, I'd tell you.

630
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,484
I don't.

631
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,405
All I have is trust.

632
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,452
Do you trust me?

633
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:41,289
With every cell
in my body.

634
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,670
Let's do this.

635
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,437
Die, you creepy shadow things!

636
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:07,023
That's for Oliver!

637
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,651
Idiots! If anyone's
gonna take over the universe,

638
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:12,862
it's gonna be me!

639
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,505
It is too late.

640
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:35,092
After 10,000 years,
I shall be victorious.

641
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:36,552
No, you won't be.

642
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,554
Such confidence.

643
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,016
You believe Corrigan prepared
you for this fight.

644
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,935
I believe my entire life
prepared me for this fight.

645
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,646
All life ends.

646
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,398
Only death is eternal.

647
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,860
Only I
am eternal.

648
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,406
We'll see about that.

649
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,344
Is this typical for you guys,
saving the world?

650
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,511
Yes!

651
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:21,097
No!

652
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,349
My team and I
usually mess things up

653
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:24,516
for the better!

654
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,728
Focus! We're in the fight
of our lives here.

655
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:14,191
You have failed...

656
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,069
this universe!

657
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:33,085
We... we did it.

658
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,438
So this is what
being a hero feels like.

659
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:36,838
Interesting.

660
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:37,922
Where's Oliver?

661
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:39,966
There!

662
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:44,721
Oliver.

663
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,097
What is that?

664
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,184
"I'll light the spark"...

665
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,519
"While you fan
the flame."

666
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,914
He said you
would know what to do.

667
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,618
I think dying kind of
messed with his head.

668
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,126
Well, think.
You're meant to be the genius.

669
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,627
A genius who's had
the fortitude

670
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,945
to read The Book of Destiny
and retain his sanity.

671
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,739
I think the jury's
still out on that one.

672
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,240
The Book of Destiny.

673
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,202
I made myself
the Paragon of Truth.

674
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:09,455
What if truth can
tell us what we need to do?

675
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,663
Being what?

676
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,626
Use what's left
of the book

677
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,085
to fan the flame.

678
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,629
How do we all
use the book?

679
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,465
We focus.

680
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,719
A singular, laser-like focus.

681
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,178
On what?

682
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,222
Humanity,

683
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:28,808
truth,

684
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:30,517
love,

685
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,394
destiny,

686
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,521
honor,

687
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,565
courage...

688
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,526
and hope.

689
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,708
No!

690
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,758
No!

691
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:11,724
Oh, my God!

692
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,937
- Oliver!
- Barry, get us there.

693
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:22,319
Oliver.

694
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,657
I...

695
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,827
I need both of you to watch
over my family.

696
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,596
Hey, Ollie. They're
gonna be fine, all right?

697
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,705
You're gonna be fine.

698
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:36,208
You did it.

699
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,003
You all did...
you all did it.

700
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:40,796
Did what?
What did we do?

701
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,506
Just look.

702
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,681
Ollie, we saw,
but what is it?

703
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,267
It's the new universe.

704
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,811
It's kind of small for a universe.

705
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,229
Wait for it, Barry.

706
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:02,526
It's almost time,
almost time.

707
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,947
There. You did it.

708
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,241
No, Ollie,
you did it, okay,

709
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,128
and that's why you got to
come back with us,

710
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,745
so we need you to
hang on, okay?

711
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,581
Sara, this is just what the Monitor
said would happen.

712
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,709
- No.
- What?

713
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,420
There was an end...

714
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,716
and there's a beginning.

715
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,971
You remember what I told you?

716
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,184
Dying is the easy part.

717
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,730
I'm at peace.

718
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:43,984
The real heroes...

719
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,028
They're the ones who
have to keep going.

720
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:49,907
So keep... going...

721
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,412
don't ever stop.

722
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:01,168
This world,
this new world...

723
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,172
it needs both of you.

724
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,070
Barry...

725
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,495
An end.

726
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,248
And a beginning.

727
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:48,132
Thank you, Oliver.

728
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,753
Greg, move your head!
