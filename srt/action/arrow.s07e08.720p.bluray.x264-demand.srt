<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,279
This is a plan
to level all of Star City.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,936
Felicity wouldn't do
something like this.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,440
Maybe she had
a change of heart,

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,874
tried to back out
last second.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,856
It'd explain why someone would
want her dead, right?

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,951
Last call out
was to someone named...

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,040
Blackstar.

9
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,190
What's this?

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,696
Something I lifted off Byrd
before he went into custody.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,915
It's a painting?
All right.

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,336
Looks like someone doesn't
want us to see this.

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,114
<i>Ricardo Diaz
is behind bars tonight,</i>

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,271
<i>thanks to the unidentified
Green Arrow.</i>

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,920
Felicity put a gun
right to my face.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,150
I don't believe you.

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,913
I made a deal
with the feds.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,151
Oliver... he'll be
a free man again.

Aah!

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,914
Hey. It's just me.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,999
Hey. I'm sorry about
earlier.

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,216
I didn't mean
to freak you out.

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,152
No. I'm just, um,
getting used

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,640
to being home.

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,670
Mm. I missed that.

50
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,433
Having someone
to zip your dress?

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,672
Well, that, and you.

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,953
And I really miss
William.

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,952
Yeah. Christmas vacation
feels like

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,793
it's 20 years from now.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,635
So why aren't you
dressed?

56
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm gonna sit this one out.

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,316
Oh, no, no, no.

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
I don't think that's
how this works,

59
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,640
especially when you're
the one being honored.

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,989
Besides, you've been
spending more time

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
in the shadows
recently

62
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,256
than when you were
the Green Arrow.

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,556
The last time I faced
the city, I was in cuffs.

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,757
A lot of people are
mad at me, Felicity.

65
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,956
I lied to them.

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,759
They have a right to be
mad at me.

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,194
Which is exactly why
this event is

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,760
so important.

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,109
They want to publicly
recognize you as a hero.

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,431
And after all the lives
you saved at slabside,

71
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,115
let them see you
for who you really are,

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,352
without a mask.

73
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,640
I mean, you're
probably right.

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,677
Oh, I'm always right.

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,559
You will always be
the best part of me

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,359
for the rest of my life.

77
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,590
You remembered.

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,558
Of course I remember.

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,712
Happy anniversary.

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,640
This used to be the
nicest club in town

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,120
20 years ago.

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,271
You can practically
smell the money.

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,273
Yeah. Definitely
not smelling that.

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,750
I can't believe Roy's
missing out on all the fun.

85
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,696
If he got recognized here,
we'd have big trouble.

86
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,155
And you're sure
Blackstar's here?

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,456
The canary network
couldn't find much,

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,870
but they did learn Blackstar
likes to frequent this club.

89
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,158
I seriously question this
person's choice of friends.

90
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,160
That's why we need
to keep our heads down.

91
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,936
Blackstar was the last one
to talk to Felicity.

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,336
Whoever this is could have
either been helping her or...

93
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,113
or they're the one
who killed her.

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,151
And you were worried this
was going to be dangerous.

95
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,576
Hey, we're looking
for someone named Blackstar.

96
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
You know who that is?

97
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,319
Yeah.
She's right there.

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,039
Uh!

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,553
Blackstar!
Blackstar! Blackstar! Blackstar!

100
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,680
Blackstar! Blackstar!
Blackstar! Blackstar!

101
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,797
Blackstar! Blackstar...

102
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,076
Well, she seems
easy to talk to.

103
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,720
We didn't get this
treatment after we

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,712
put Diaz behind bars.

105
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,273
Envy is not
a good look on you.

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,794
Neither is
the crab cake

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,559
on your face.

108
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,075
This event is
messed up.

109
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,117
Rich folk and politicians
fronting

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,271
like they actually care
about prison reform.

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,955
If everybody in here
actually gave a crap,

112
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,474
they'd use that money
to help people

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,336
in hard-up neighborhoods
who end up in the system

114
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,874
because they don't
have anything else.

115
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,318
What?

116
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,113
You ever think about
running for office?

117
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,896
Oliver, what's it
like to be out of prison?

118
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,320
How does it feel to be
back home

119
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
with everyone knowing
you're the Green Arrow?

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,696
Are you gonna put on the
hood now that you're back?

121
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,315
My husband
is very grateful

122
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,790
to be home with
his family. Thank you.

123
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,991
Excuse me. Queen!

124
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,480
Max Fuller.

125
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,517
Hey, man, I know we've
had some bad history.

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,159
You, uh, had
your bodyguards

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,016
kick the crap out of me
and Tommy at your club.

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
Right. Well, you slept
with my wife.

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,156
Well, now my ex-wife.

130
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,516
Dude, all that is in
the past, OK?

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,159
You're the freaking
Green Arrow.

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,469
Well, I'm Felicity.

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,234
I am the wife of
the freaking Green Arrow.

134
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,896
That sounded a little less
strange in my head.

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,400
Impressed.

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,216
You see, he didn't used
to be the marriage type.

137
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
- Ah. Hmm.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,834
But, hey, people
change, right?

139
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,195
Yes, they do.

140
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,936
And we are just gonna say hi
to some friends

141
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
if you'll excuse us.

142
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,753
Yeah, please.

143
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,750
Is it just me,

144
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,593
or is that guy
the absolute worst?

145
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,314
I never got to ask you.

146
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
What was your first meal
when you got back?

147
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,318
Double double
at big belly burger.

148
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,551
That's what I'm
talking about.

149
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,429
Taking a while to get
those sea legs back, huh?

150
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,954
Speaking of,

151
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,176
you thinking about
getting back out there,

152
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,376
trying that old suit
on for size?

153
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,629
Shh, shh. No, no, no.

154
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,870
He's absolutely not

155
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,792
just like we don't
do that anymore.

156
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,200
Dinah's right.

157
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,511
I'm very much enjoying not
being in prison.

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,670
So what now?

159
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,353
I don't know.

160
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,856
Find a different way
to help the city,

161
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,633
way you guys did.

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
What about you, Felicity?

163
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,917
I'm developing a new
security system.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,834
Well, then I'm sure
it's the best one in town.

165
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,990
We're friends
with her now?

166
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,400
It's more like frenemies.

167
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,675
It's a long story.

168
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,673
Relax. I'm just here
keeping up appearances.

169
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,319
D.A., remember?

170
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,016
Actually, we should all
really be thanking Laurel.

171
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,536
I mean, she is the one
who did the trade

172
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,040
to get Oliver out of prison.

173
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,236
That's true.

174
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,879
I'm very grateful.

175
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,233
I know that I haven't
always given you

176
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,039
the benefit
of the doubt, so...

177
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,560
Well, it was
really Felicity

178
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,075
who was willing to do
anything to stop Diaz.

179
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,119
She's ruthless.

180
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Welcome.

181
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,557
Thank you all
for attending this evening.

182
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,314
I would like to introduce
this evening's honoree,

183
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,312
Mr. Oliver Queen.

184
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,074
Thank you,
Mayor Pollard.

185
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,075
I used to believe
that justice was

186
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,518
as simple as putting
criminals behind bars...

187
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,434
But then I spent
some time in prison,

188
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,672
and I realized that
the truth is

189
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,399
nowhere near
that black and white.

190
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,079
The truth is that
our institutions have

191
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,435
a long way to go

192
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
before they achieve
true justice.

193
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,956
The attack perpetrated by
the Green Arrow this evening

194
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,713
is further proof
why we, as a city,

195
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,355
cannot trust men
that hide behind masks.

196
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,672
There is a reason why the
anti-vigilante law exists.

197
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,989
Thank you.

198
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,117
Look, I know
how this looks,

199
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,112
but this wasn't
the new Green Arrow.

200
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,554
He hasn't murdered
anyone.

201
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
That
you know of.

202
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,896
Has anyone actually seen
who's behind the mask?

203
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,389
Well, no. But whoever it is
has been helping the city.

204
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,960
And helped us
take down Diaz.

205
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,111
This was
cold-blooded murder.

206
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,510
Now, I appreciate how
all of you feel as though

207
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,239
the new Green Arrow
is an ally,

208
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,720
but I would like to be sure.

209
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,995
And how are you
gonna do that

210
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,793
if you're a no-go
on the Arrow?

211
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,872
Is there a law against
me consulting?

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,296
You mean an investigative consultant,
like <i>The Mentalist?</i>

213
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,356
I love that show.

214
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,318
I can't think of
a better way to investigate

215
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,056
a copycat Green Arrow than
with the original.

216
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,912
I can.
With my help,

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,832
because I'm not
sitting this one out.

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,036
I appreciate it,

219
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,256
but there's nothing left
to be done tonight,

220
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,316
so go home.

221
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,834
Let my guys work the scene.

222
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,957
And if I need help, I'll
call you tomorrow.

223
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,514
This is everything Dinah's
compiled on the vigilante...

224
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,478
every sighting, targets.

225
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
It's all there.

226
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,915
It says here
the SCPD

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,056
nearly arrested him
last month.

228
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,514
But he had
an accomplice?

229
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,796
Uh, yeah, that...
that was me.

230
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,439
I, uh,

231
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,432
I didn't want Dinah
to lock him up.

232
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,159
Oh, I bet she really
appreciated that.

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,469
She threw my ass in jail.

234
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,914
I'm really sad
I missed that.

235
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,793
What else do we
know?

236
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,920
Uh, he's definitely
not a rookie. I know that.

237
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,839
I mean, the guy's efficient,
disciplined, precise.

238
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,096
I mean,
he works the bow and Arrow

239
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,839
about as well as you do.

240
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
That takes

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,832
a very specific
type of training.

242
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,358
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

243
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,715
Pollard's on the warpath.

244
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,235
That's OK.
Forensics pull anything from the scene?

245
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,198
Nothing we didn't
already suspect.

246
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,237
Arrows are consistent
with the vigilantes.

247
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,436
Here. Take a look.

248
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,193
Thank you.

249
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,393
Well, they're both
handmade.

250
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,154
The materials in the Arrowhead
seem to match.

251
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,799
This would be difficult
to replicate.

252
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,872
But not impossible,
right?

253
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,679
The security camera
footage?

254
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,275
Yeah, but you're
not gonna find much.

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,680
The killer was
off-camera.

256
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,399
His Arrows weren't.

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,256
If this guy is as precise
with a bow and Arrow

258
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,715
as Rene says, then he
would've had a target.

259
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,753
Based on trajectory,
that guy.

260
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,956
Oh, wait a minute. That's...
that's Clayton Ford.

261
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,920
He's a rich dude who
actually helped The Glades.

262
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,155
He funded a clinic.

263
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,435
This makes no sense.

264
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,279
The vigilante's only
targeted people

265
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,476
who've hurt The Glades.

266
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,596
Ford helped it.

267
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,512
Then what the hell's
the motive?

268
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Sure would help

269
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,350
if we could ask
directly.

270
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,796
Wait. Hang on.

271
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,633
You're... you're in contact?

272
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,712
That was one time,
all right?

273
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,960
And count me out if we're
gonna roll up and arrest him.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,376
I'm not talking about the SCPD.

275
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,313
Just us.
We just need to talk to the new Green Arrow.

276
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,710
You think he's
innocent. So we'll be fine.

277
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,800
And what if we aren't?

278
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,877
Then we deal with it.

279
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,917
You should make
the call.

280
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Hey.

281
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,359
Got to say,
I never appreciated

282
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,874
how tightly you run
this ship

283
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,394
until you were gone
with the brass.

284
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,616
It is so good to see you
behind that desk again, Lyla.

285
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,552
Flatterer.

286
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,795
Shut the door.

287
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,553
What's going on?

288
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,279
I had my contact look
into the image

289
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,239
that Curtis decrypted
from the Malcolm Byrd op.

290
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,674
The <i>Dante</i> painting.

291
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,160
It's being used
as some sort of

292
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,879
highly advanced
identification protocol

293
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,553
within terrorist Circles.

294
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,359
Kobra, Basilisk,

295
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,794
the third world
liberation army...

296
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,310
they're all using the name
Dante like it's a contact.

297
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,312
For what? Or for who?

298
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,076
I don't know, but I might
know how to find out.

299
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,958
When I cross-referenced
the terrorist groups

300
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,874
with the financials that
we obtained in Geneva,

301
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,280
I found a common account.

302
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,589
Could you trace it?

303
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,797
No. Come here.
Look at this.

304
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,393
Five transactions
in the past 7 months

305
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,233
between Dante
and a consulting firm

306
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,317
called rubrum,
silentium, and ursa.

307
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,757
That's Latin for
"red," "silent," and "bear,"

308
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,274
the Longbow Hunters.

309
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,680
Look.

310
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,311
You got to be
kidding me.

311
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,273
This is definitely
the place.

312
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,476
Then where is he?

313
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,552
Maybe he got
held up.

314
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,395
Rene, stop.

315
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,560
What are you talking about?

316
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,393
There are
motion detectors.

317
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
We've been made.

318
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,954
I said come alone.

319
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,838
These are my friends.

320
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,640
You already met
captain Drake.

321
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,473
You can trust them.

322
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,755
We only want
to talk.

323
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,115
I'll pass.

324
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,839
A piece of advice

325
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,230
from one Green Arrow
to another:

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,470
Cooperate.

327
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,430
Because right now,

328
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,591
most of the people
in this city think

329
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,399
you're a killer.

330
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,759
Are you?

331
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,079
- Cut him off!
- On it.

332
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,040
Mr. Queen. Mr. Queen,
Mr. Queen,

333
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,713
do you know who
the new Green Arrow is?

334
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,936
Are you helping with
this investigation?

335
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,110
I have no comment, guys.

336
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,016
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What the hell is this?

337
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,456
You all know the precinct
is off-limits.

338
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,994
Captain Drake,
care to comment?

339
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,437
The SCPD does not comment
on ongoing investigations.

340
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,557
But I do. The vigilante
didn't do it.

341
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,792
OK. Can somebody please
get these guys out of here?

342
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Not helping.

343
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,557
Hey. Why does the mayor
have to have all the fun?

344
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,313
Maybe meeting
at the precinct

345
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
wasn't the best idea.

346
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,736
Yeah. Well, I thought
the jig was up

347
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,056
after you were spotted
last night.

348
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,480
Oh, and speaking
of last night,

349
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,496
turns out we were right about
your Green Arrow clone.

350
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,636
He is innocent.

351
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
How do we know?

352
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Remember our second suspected target,
Clayton Ford?

353
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,136
- Mm-hmm.
- My guys found him dead

354
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,296
across town at the same time
we were chasing the vigilante.

355
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,118
- We're his alibi.
- OK.

356
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,078
What do we know about
the Ford murder?

357
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,594
Emerald Arrow,
center chest,

358
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
same as Hutchinson.

359
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,678
Someone's going
through a lot of trouble

360
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,399
to pin this on
the new Green Arrow.

361
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,518
We really need to come up
with a better name for him.

362
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,195
He's making everyone,
including Pollard,

363
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,316
look away.

364
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,590
The question is from what?

365
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,750
Well, Ford
may have known.

366
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,832
He was trying to skip
town when he was killed.

367
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,798
We found him with bags
packed and ready to go,

368
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,075
clothes and cash.

369
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,480
Yeah, he knew he was
the target.

370
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,074
What the hell is going on?

371
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,715
Last time I checked,
Mr. Queen and Mr. Ramirez

372
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,473
were not employed by
the SCPD.

373
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,176
Well, they're just here
giving statements.

374
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,351
That the vigilante didn't
do it. Yeah, I heard.

375
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,397
You know,
it's no big surprise

376
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,296
that the old Green Arrow would
be supporting the new one,

377
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,357
but I expected more from
my police captain.

378
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,136
You telling me how to
conduct my investigation,

379
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,276
Ms. Mayor?

380
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,760
Because last I checked,

381
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,256
I was still in control
of this precinct.

382
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,193
I hired you to restore the
city's faith in this department.

383
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,431
That means bringing that
vigilante to justice.

384
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,994
And if you can't do that,

385
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,515
I will find someone else
who can.

386
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,273
She may be
the tiniest,

387
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,471
most unpleasant person
I've ever met.

388
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,519
You have to listen
to her, but I don't.

389
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,080
What are you thinking?

390
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,435
It says here both
victims were

391
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,432
members of the same
society at Yale.

392
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,160
I know a guy, Max Fuller.
He was a member, too.

393
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,836
I could go see him,
gather some intel.

394
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,832
I'll be in touch if I
learn anything, all right?

395
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,511
Excuse me,
Ms., uh, Blackstar?

396
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,831
Can we talk to you?

397
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,956
I'm kind of busy.

398
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,110
Clearly.

399
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,032
We only need 5 minutes.

400
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,759
Not interested.

401
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,080
Like I said,

402
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,674
I'd love to talk.

403
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,672
So this whole
fight club thing,

404
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,594
you just beat people
up for what? Fun?

405
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,319
Stress relief.

406
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,200
Do you really want to
spend your 5 minutes

407
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,839
talking about
my hobbies?

408
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,256
How do you know
Felicity Smoak?

409
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,919
I don't.

410
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,957
Well, that's strange,
because you were

411
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,960
the last person she called
before she was killed.

412
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,789
Felicity's dead?

413
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,155
Oh, so you do know her.

414
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,675
We worked together
sometimes.

415
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,035
What kind of work was that?

416
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,077
The kind that's none
of your business.

417
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,480
So, illegal.

418
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,196
Well, you're one
to talk, canary.

419
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,749
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

420
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,150
But you want to come
in here and judge me?

421
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,993
At least I'm not
lying to everyone,

422
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,640
pretending to be
some kind of hero.

423
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,712
At least I'm not
a vigilante.

424
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,315
You don't know what you're
talking about, kid.

425
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,816
You know, you're part of
the reason Star City is

426
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,040
in the shape it's
in right now.

427
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,594
Really? 'Cause I
could've sworn,

428
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,672
the story goes,
it's because of you.

429
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,355
Hey, just tell us why
Felicity called you.

430
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,760
Then we'll leave you alone.

431
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
I work as a broker.

432
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,512
I help people find
certain items.

433
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,760
Felicity asked me to
find her

434
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,956
an electrical
firing circuit

435
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,269
and a couple
transmitters.

436
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,158
Those are mechanisms for
triggering a bomb.

437
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,536
I don't know
why she needed 'em.

438
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,472
I didn't ask.

439
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,280
As long as I get paid,
you can ask for whatever you want.

440
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,960
Sounds like you two had
a lot in common.

441
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,992
If that's it, I have
my next fight coming up,

442
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,878
and I really
should stretch.

443
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,917
Yeah. I'm done here anyway.

444
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,080
Word of advice.

445
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,275
Asking questions
about Felicity Smoak

446
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,558
will not end well
for anyone.

447
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,399
Five
fully-stocked bars,

448
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,550
3 private lounges,

449
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,990
and the sound system is
the best...

450
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,309
Outside of Europe.

451
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,914
A.i. Adjusts
the acoustic environment

452
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,070
based on capacity.

453
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,311
Right this way here.

454
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,035
That's a ton of security
you got down there, Max.

455
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,157
It must be costing
you a fortune.

456
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,136
Heh! Not when you pay for them
with crypto you mine yourself.

457
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,958
All it costs me is
the little USB drive

458
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,997
I put it on. Scotch?

459
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,834
It's a 25-year.

460
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,956
Why not?

461
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,311
We can toast your new club.

462
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,110
Hey. Toast to your new prison-and
Green Arrow-free life.

463
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,277
It's really got to piss
you off, though, huh?

464
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,511
Seeing some lame copycat
screw up

465
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,478
everything you
sacrificed for.

466
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,074
I wanted to speak with you
about that.

467
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,391
The last two murders weren't
connected to the vigilante.

468
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,918
So the rumors are true.

469
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,231
You are helping the cops
investigate this.

470
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,913
How can I help?

471
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,992
You were a member of
the scroll and key

472
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,116
back at Yale.

473
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,680
Allegedly.

474
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,320
It is a secret society.

475
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,595
Fair point.

476
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
How well did you
know Clayton Ford

477
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,269
and Sam Hutchinson?

478
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,556
Clay and hutch.

479
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
Well enough to mourn them.

480
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Mm-hmm.

481
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,873
But we'd sort of fallen
out of touch.

482
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,776
Ford looked like he was
trying to skip town

483
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,359
before he died,

484
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,715
like he knew the hit
was coming,

485
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,593
but we just... we
don't know how.

486
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,239
You're looking for
skeletons.

487
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,800
And are we gonna
find any?

488
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,816
I know you're not supposed
to talk ill of the dead

489
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,958
or whatever, but, you know,
there were always rumors

490
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,816
that they had shady
business dealings going on

491
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,912
with the triad, I believe.

492
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,277
So who knows? Maybe they got
in over their heads.

493
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,437
Probably.

494
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,113
I won't take up any
more of your time.

495
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,230
Thank you, Max.

496
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,436
You mind if I ask you
a question?

497
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,752
They sent you to prison
for helping this city.

498
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,154
Why the hell should you
care about any of this?

499
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,719
Old habits.

500
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,195
I guess some people don't
change that much after all.

501
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,795
Hey.

502
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,749
Sorry I'm late.

503
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,479
That's OK.

504
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,439
I'm still getting used to
you coming home at all.

505
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,591
How did things go
with Fuller?

506
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,319
Max Fuller is
hiding something.

507
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,039
Do you mind looking
into it?

508
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,998
Of course.

509
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,918
Hey, you just came in
the front door,

510
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,469
and none of my security
measures triggered.

511
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,630
You sure?

512
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,874
Felicity!

513
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,359
Who are you?

514
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,274
My husband asked you
a question.

515
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,589
Where'd you get that?

516
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,558
We'll talk about it later.

517
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,233
Stay down!

518
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,674
Hey, hey.

519
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,776
All right. As soon
as the doc gives the OK,

520
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,536
we'll take him into
the station for questioning.

521
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,553
In the meantime, we'll go through his
effects, see what we can find out.

522
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,915
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

523
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,719
Oh, hey, and just
a bit of advice.

524
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Yeah.

525
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,720
You probably shouldn't be shooting
people your first week out of prison.

526
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,956
- That's a good tip.
- Yeah.

527
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,552
He must've somehow
countered my alarm

528
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,016
by sonically hacking
into the sensors.

529
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Felicity.

530
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
That is a design flaw that
could take weeks to fix.

531
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,396
- We need to talk about this.
- No. We need to be safe.

532
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,256
This security system was
supposed to bring peace of mind.

533
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,033
- You mean like owning a gun?
- Yeah.

534
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,553
Where'd you even get a gun?

535
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,160
Your best new friend
Laurel?

536
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,993
Of course not.

537
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,833
I got it from your
ex-best friend, Anatoly.

538
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,196
You what?

539
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,476
I've barely been gone
7 months,

540
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,710
and you've aligned yourself

541
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,792
with two of the most immoral
people we know?

542
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,599
Oliver, you don't
get to judge me.

543
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,056
You just shot a man in
our living room.

544
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,912
Something you've done
a million times.

545
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,559
Hey, this isn't you.

546
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,519
You don't obsess over
security.

547
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,557
You certainly
don't carry a gun.

548
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,199
This is me, Oliver,

549
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,896
not because I was influenced
by Laurel or Anatoly.

550
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,559
This is me
because of you.

551
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,472
You were the one
that decided

552
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,841
all on your own that you were
going to sacrifice yourself,

553
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,872
leaving your son
and your wife

554
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,077
alone at home as
sitting ducks for Diaz.

555
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,000
And the best part about
the whole thing is that

556
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,000
you didn't even ask us
about how we felt about it.

557
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
I've already apologized
for this.

558
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
I don't know how many times
you need me to apologize.

559
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,800
What am I supposed to do
with an apology, Oliver?

560
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,678
I'm just supposed
to move on?

561
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,040
While you were gone,

562
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,112
I had to figure out
how to survive.

563
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,838
And I am glad that
I did

564
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,913
because the old me,
she was weak.

565
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,037
How could you possibly
think that?

566
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,995
The old you was the person
I fell in love with.

567
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,034
Well...

568
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,754
She's gone.

569
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,351
And she's not
coming back.

570
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,479
I thought you didn't drink.

571
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,994
Yeah, well, it's been
a tough week.

572
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,399
I know the feeling.

573
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,755
You know, Roy told me

574
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,274
this would only
bring me pain,

575
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,399
and he was right.

576
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,519
I'm going home.

577
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,752
Just like that, huh,
without any answers?

578
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,990
Felicity is dead.

579
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,390
And before that,
she had a plan to blow up an entire city.

580
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,437
So I'm not sure exactly
why I'm supposed to care

581
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,438
about what happened
to her.

582
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,038
I'm just sorry I dragged
you all into this.

583
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,072
You need to see something.

584
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,032
It's called
the mark of four.

585
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,873
Your dad came up with it.

586
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,869
I don't remember that.

587
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,360
You were already gone.

588
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,478
It was right before
everything.

589
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,996
It symbolizes the 4 pillars
of heroism...

590
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,919
courage, compassion,
selflessness, and loyalty.

591
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,193
We all got them as
a reminder that

592
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,751
no matter what happened,
if one of us was in trouble,

593
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,400
the other ones would
be there.

594
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,191
That's why Roy came with
you back to Star City.

595
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,998
He saw the symbol written on the
inside of your father's bow.

596
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,035
So that's why you're
helping us?

597
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,831
I didn't know what to
make of you at first.

598
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,389
Trust doesn't come
so easily to me.

599
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah? So what changed?

600
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,876
I started seeing the best
parts of your dad in you...

601
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,077
the strength that
made him a hero.

602
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,350
I am not that.

603
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,238
You sure about that?

604
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,236
'Cause your dad,
he had this way of looking into things,

605
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,391
of seeing beyond
the evidence.

606
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,158
So what does your gut
tell you about Blackstar?

607
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,792
That she isn't telling
us the whole story.

608
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,193
Good. Let's find out
what she's hiding.

609
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,073
Hey, hey.
Who's hungry?

610
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,516
Ohh. You're a life saver.

611
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,831
It's not often I get to buy
the police captain dinner.

612
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Yeah?

613
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,997
Well, you'd better get
your fill in now

614
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,117
because I probably won't
have this job much longer.

615
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,238
Why? You don't think this
will blow over with Pollard?

616
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,152
Well...

617
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,038
I don't know.

618
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,917
You know,
maybe it shouldn't.

619
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,320
How can I really
be effective here

620
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,273
if she's just gonna
undercut me the whole way?

621
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,874
I'd be better off
as Black Canary.

622
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,314
Whew. You don't know
how long

623
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,591
I've been waiting for you
to say that.

624
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,798
But you're the best damn
person for this job, d.

625
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,076
This city needs you here.

626
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,376
Hey. How's it going
with the hitman?

627
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,073
Good. He's still
recovering,

628
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,392
but we got an ID
thanks to A.R.G.U.S.

629
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,996
Frank Cassaday, otherwise
known as the mirror.

630
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,072
Specializes in kills
via mimicked M.O.

631
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,440
Proof the vigilante
didn't do it,

632
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,597
but who ordered the hits?

633
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Where'd you find that?

634
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,576
I found that on Cassaday.
Why? You recognize that?

635
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,315
Fuller.
He used those to pay his muscle in the club.

636
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,834
This was Fuller.

637
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,593
He ordered the hit on
Hutchinson

638
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,750
and then Ford
and then me

639
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,354
once I got too close.

640
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,199
Why? I mean,
he's a rich douchebag,

641
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,680
but I didn't peg him
to be a killer.

642
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,234
Felicity ran
background on Fuller.

643
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,874
He had secret
business dealings

644
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,713
with both
Hutchinson and Ford.

645
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
If they were gonna
cut him out,

646
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,029
this was payback.

647
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,640
All right. Well, the hit
on you failed,

648
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,696
so that means Fuller's gonna
know something's up soon

649
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,915
if he doesn't
already, right?

650
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,336
I'm gonna send s.W.A.T. In
while we still have

651
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,396
the element of surprise.

652
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,039
It's not
that simple.

653
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,760
Fuller's in there right now
with at least 12 hired guns,

654
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,513
and the club is
at capacity.

655
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,795
So it could get
really messy.

656
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,912
Guys.

657
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,276
It won't get messy

658
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,716
if the Green Arrow goes in...
the o.G. One.

659
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,829
No. I... I can't risk being
separated from my family,

660
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Rene.

661
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,719
I can't do it.

662
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,676
I might know a way you can.

663
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,399
Even if you did,

664
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,674
Pollard would never
stand for it.

665
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,194
Pollard wanted me
to restore

666
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,576
the city's faith in
this department,

667
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,034
and that is never
gonna happen if we

668
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,720
keep treating our heroes
like criminals.

669
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,591
It's time the mayor
realizes that.

670
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,118
Dinah, I trust you,
but you have to be sure.

671
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,638
Half this city believes
in the vigilante

672
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,473
because they were hoping
it was you.

673
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,356
Now they don't have
to hope anymore.

674
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,955
OK.

675
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,114
I need to make
a pit stop.

676
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,552
The bunker has seen
better days.

677
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,869
Yes, it has.

678
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,160
It didn't seem right
coming back here

679
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,600
after the team
disbanded.

680
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,277
Thanks for bringing this.

681
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,079
The FBI still has mine.

682
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,616
It's a good thing
you made another one.

683
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,632
Yeah.

684
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,837
Does that mean you
changed your mind

685
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,435
about breaking
the cycle of violence?

686
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,920
No.

687
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,833
I cannot Burden William
with this.

688
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,030
But it's not just about
breaking the cycle of violence.

689
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,155
It's about accountability.

690
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,193
What does that mean
to you?

691
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,476
If Star City wants
to hate the Green Arrow,

692
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,040
that's fine.

693
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,674
They'll have
to hate me, too.

694
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
You want some backup
out there?

695
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,757
Thank you, but this time,
I got to go solo.

696
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,910
Hey.

697
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,673
Yeah.

698
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,913
Don't you need this?

699
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,880
No.

was done.

705
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,432

Drop the gun, Max.

729
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,351
- I'll shoot.
- Hiring killers is easy.

730
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,079
Taking the shot
yourself isn't.

731
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,073
Oh. You're a vigilante.

732
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,595
You don't have the authority
to arrest me.

733
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,716
She does.

734
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,917
Max Fuller, you are
under arrest

735
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,559
for the murder
of Clayton Ford

736
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,160
and Sam Hutchinson.

737
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,192
Take Mr. Fuller into
booking.

738
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,960
Should I give you two
a minute?

739
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,999
We do this together.

740
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,632
Ms. Mayor, to what do
I owe the pleasure?

741
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,274
You've got
some nerve.

742
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,914
I want Mr. Queen booked

743
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,639
in violation of
the anti-vigilante law.

744
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,552
Hmm. Afraid I
can't do that.

745
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,072
Then I want
your resignation.

746
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,674
I think that would be
a mistake.

747
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,638
Oh, that's rich,
coming from the man

748
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,632
who stared this city
in the face and lied.

749
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,518
You made a mockery
of city hall.

750
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,637
I'm gonna show you that
no one is above the law.

751
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,030
I could not
agree with you more,

752
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,238
which is why, as of
today, Mr. Queen

753
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,154
is officially working
for the SCPD.

754
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,519
He's no longer
a vigilante.

755
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,432
I'll get that tossed
by this time tomorrow.

756
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,477
Well, you can try, but
I have a strong feeling

757
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,880
the district attorney is going
to side with me on this one.

758
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,195
This isn't over,

759
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,832
not even close.

760
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,117
This should be fun.

761
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,757
Got to warn you,
this one's a handful.

762
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,718
We know.

763
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,712
You sure you're
good with this?

764
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,634
Hiding the truth from
Oliver and Felicity? No.

765
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,757
But this is the strongest
lead we've got.

766
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,990
If we don't exploit it now,

767
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,993
who knows how many people
will be hurt later?

768
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,794
<i>Open it.</i>

769
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,317
We'll take it from here.

770
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,637
Hello, Mr. Diaz.
Remember me?

771
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,791
I'm sure you remember
my husband.

772
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
What do you want?

773
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,073
We need your help.

774
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,591
Man. And I thought
I was messy.

775
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,070
How are we supposed to find
anything in this place?

776
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,919
Guys!

777
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,200
These are the bomb
schematics we found

778
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,276
in Felicity's
hideout.

779
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,636
Blackstar knew about her
plan to blow up Star City.

780
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,076
Maybe she didn't just
know about it.

781
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,640
Maybe she was part of it.

782
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,871
Huh. If Felicity
got cold feet,

783
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,456
that's one hell of a motive
to kill her.

784
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,039
OK. But why
hang on to these?

785
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,112
I mean, why not
destroy the evidence?

786
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,271
Because she's still
planning on using them.

787
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,317
OK, we have got to
go to the cops.

788
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,993
The SCPD are a joke.

789
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
They'd love to watch

790
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,470
Star City go up in flames.

791
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,271
Well, there is
another option.

792
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,116
We go to The Glades.

793
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,078
I thought we weren't
welcome there.

794
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,153
Well, we're not,
but she is.

795
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,076
No. No way.

796
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,879
Zoe, we don't know
when or where

797
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,519
this is going
to happen, right?

798
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,560
And by the time we find out,
it could be too late.

799
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,796
I don't love the idea
either,

800
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,280
but we need resources.

801
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,516
I guess it's time to
pay my dad a visit.

802
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,116
<i>With the successful
arrest of Max Fuller assisted</i>

803
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,989
<i>by Oliver Queen, the Green Arrow
will officially be working</i>

804
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,437
<i>on the side of the law
hand in hand with the SCPD,</i>

805
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,591
<i>marking a new era
for Star City.</i>

806
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,910
Well...

807
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,196
It looks like
you're famous again.

808
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,713
Could you have
imagined 7 years ago

809
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,920
that you'd be working unmasked
and alongside the cops?

810
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,513
A lot has changed.

811
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Yeah.

812
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,799
All those months
at slabside,

813
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,776
there wasn't a day that
went by...

814
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
there wasn't an hour

815
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,760
that went by I didn't think
about you and William and...

816
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,355
Getting our life back.

817
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,999
Me, too.

818
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,159
OK.

819
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,959
So what's changed?

820
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,035
I think time apart
forced us to move

821
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,156
in different
directions.

822
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,596
OK. But how do we...

823
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,631
Start pushing in the same
direction again?

824
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,154
I want to.

825
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,634
Mm-hmm.

826
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,439
But you're right.

827
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,591
You know,
I've changed...

828
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,279
More than you know.

829
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,754
I almost killed Diaz,

830
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,956
and I would've
killed him

831
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,236
if Laurel
hadn't stopped me.

832
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,795
And I know that you're
gonna want

833
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,176
to talk me down to
the old Felicity,

834
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,590
the one that you met
chewing that red pen.

835
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,879
While you were gone,

836
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,236
I had to learn how
to protect myself.

837
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,536
I put you in the position
where you had to do that,

838
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
and I'm sorry.

839
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,279
No. This isn't on you.

840
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,313
Well... OK.

841
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,790
I love you more than
a human being

842
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,314
should love another
human being.

843
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,470
I just don't know

844
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,279
if what's best for me
right now is

845
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,240
the same thing
as what's best for us.

846
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,552
Hey, dad, turns out Oliver
is more like you

847
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,359
than I thought,

848
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,159
more like me, too.

849
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,593
But I'm not giving up,

850
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,714
not ever.

851
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,550
You failed.

852
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,354
Why are you doing this?

853
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,113
You did this
to yourself.

854
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,558
And now all of you
will perish.

855
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,200
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
