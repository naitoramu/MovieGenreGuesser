00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,330
That's normal in these cases

136
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,830
because, see,
there is so much tension in here.

137
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,910
Too much tension, but don't worry.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,790
I’m gonna get you something
for that anxiety.

139
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,330
'Cause the thing is,
we really don't want you to suffer

140
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,500
from post-traumatic stress
because it's hard to get over.

141
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,160
And, well, in some cases,

142
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,080
it could even last forever.

143
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,290
Hey.

144
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,040
Come here. Let me help you.
You have blood on you.

145
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,080
Don't worry, honey,
because as long as I'm around,

146
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,910
I'll make sure
you have everything you need.

I didn't.

151
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,250
- We never acted like assholes.
- Maybe I have some trauma.

152
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,120
Maybe that's what's going on.
Maybe we all have trauma.

153
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,500
What are you saying?
What trauma do I have?

154
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,510
- Maybe I shouldn't say it.
- Tell...

155
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,790
You broke up with Tokyo.

156
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,080
How many guys, other than you,
would break up with Tokyo?

157
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,830
Nobody. Nobody would break up with that.

158
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,080
What do you know about Tokyo?

159
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,040
Tokyo's a fucking Maserati,
and everyone wants a Maserati.

160
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
And if you take a Maserati,
leave it on the street,

161
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,790
doors open and keys in the ignition,

162
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,540
you've gotta be really fucked up.

163
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,120
Look, RÍO...

164
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,870
I'm gonna make this really clear.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,580
Maybe you're traumatized
'cause they screwed with your manhood.

166
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,250
Maybe they changed you
with the... the torture.

167
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,750
But you need to let it go.

168
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,200
That's why you broke up with Tokyo, huh?

169
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,290
If you were hurt by one person

170
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,410
or a group, the trauma is no different,
so let it go!

171
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,580
You can count on me.
I'm here to help with anything you need.

Keep up the good work. You're doing great.

I'm leaving.

180

It's been a pleasure working with you,
as always.

And I would even say...

182

that I love you dearly, Matías.

As for you all,

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,830
I hope my leadership
hasn't been too traumatic.

But at least it'll be a fun story

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,830
I can't be with you.

291
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,910
<font color="#ff00ff">[DRAMATIC EMOTIONAL MUSIC]</font>

292
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Look...

293
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,410
When you see her coming at you
as angry as a hydra, well, you shut up.

294
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,330
A hydra.

295
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,080
Um, no? Well, forget it.
Just keep your mouth shut.

296
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
- And I don't defend myself?
- No.

297
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,160
Because you don't even know
what she's angry about.

298
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,790
You shut up,

299
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,200
and the less you know
what she's talking about,

300
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,290
the more sorry you look.

301
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,950
All you say is,

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,700
"yes" and "I am sorry, my love."

303
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,370
Now, that's a textbook case.

304
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,950
- Sounds like a textbook for pussies.
- A textbook for survivors.

305
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,790
You wait for the storm to pass,

306
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,870
and then, when you figure out
where the wind is coming from,

307
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,580
and when she seems to be calmed down,

308
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,040
well, then and only then...

309
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,660
you make a move.

310
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,540
Understand what I'm saying?

311
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,370
She's been mad at me since the monastery.

312
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,620
That's what's going on.

313
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,000
- Well...
- Yeah.

314
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,410
We dragged it all here.

315
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,500
And because of the pressure
from the heist, it all explodes.

316
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,950
That's what's going on.

320
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,000
He was about to explode
the main operation room,

<i>- but I have it under control.</i>
- No, you don't.

322
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,410
You can't control Palermo
because he's unpredictable.

323
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,660
He's tied up

Tokyo, the whole plan is falling apart!

I'm still here... Professor.

So what if you’re still there, Tokyo?

was camouflaged in a tree,

341
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,370
There were soldiers,
and police were everywhere.

342
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,910
<i>And she was in a farm.
That’s where they found her.</i>

343
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,330
<i>They made her kneel down,
unarmed, and they asked about me.</i>

<i>And I ran and ran, and...</i>

345
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,750
They asked her, "Where's the Professor?"

346
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,540
I said, "Tell them, Raquel.

347
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,620
Tell them where I am.

348
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,580
Tell them I'll surrender. Please."

349

<i>"I don't know."</i>

351
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,200
<i>And they shot her two times.</i>

352
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
She was unarmed,
and they shot her two times.

353
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,500
I couldn't make it on time.

354
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,910
<i>But did you see it?</i>

355
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,540
No.

356
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,830
You only heard it?

357
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,790
Professor, did you see them move the body?

358
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I had to run.

359
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,290
<i>Listen to me.</i>

360
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,580
I also heard my mother
telling me to come home,

361
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>that I'd be safe there, but there were
20 cops waiting for me in her kitchen.</i>

362
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
And in the tent,

363
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,540
they also heard us escaping from the bank.

364
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,910
<i>But we're still here.</i>

365
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,330
<i>The only one that got out
was the little ferret with a jumpsuit.</i>

366
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,410
<i>Did they publish anything?</i>

367
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,370
Nothing.

368
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,660
Just like with RÍO.

369
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,330
If they really killed her, we'd know.

370
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,450
She's being interrogated.

371
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,000
- Where you going, Professor?
- To the Bank of Spain.

372
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,660
No, no, no.
It's not a good idea. It’s too risky.

373
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,080
I appreciate your concern,
but it's the only place

374
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,790
where I can find out
if my wife is still alive. Move.

375
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,370
- No!
- I'm asking you nicely.

376
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,750
- No!
- Step aside, Marseille...

377
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,000
I won't allow you
to get on the motorbike.

that the prosecutor and the judge
are gonna work...

390

based on what I write in these reports.

And I can write whatever I want.

What would you like me to write?

393
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,540
Are you going to force me
to resort to violence?

394
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,410
- I’m only protecting the plan.
- I decide the plan!

That's not the plan.
That's an improvisation.

no improvisation.

398
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,540
I want you to understand
that I need to be there.

399
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,330
The only place I can get answers

If you were reincarnated seven times,

you'd never understand

Alicia Sierra is interrogating my wife,

But you can't go!

420

Allow me to tell you
about the real nature of your love.

421
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,910
One in Soto del Real,
and the other in Cádiz,

422
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,500
waiting for a conjugal visit once a year.

423
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,700
And that's if you’re lucky
because if we don't catch your sweetheart,

424
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,660
<i>then you'll never see him again
in your fucking life.</i>

<i>The choice is yours.</i>

Either that or actually have the time
to raise to your daughter.

427
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,250
You're not trying
to fuck with my emotions, Alicia.

And how are you gonna get to the tent

432
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,410
Just like everyone else.

Give me your hand.

How many of your old relationships
feel completely meaningless now?

439

The same thing will happen with this one,

- I had two already.

450

- This is a strange wedding, Andrés.
- This is so great!

- I don’t think so.
- Little brother!

452
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,930
I feel sorry for her because she's young
and she's in love,

Andrés, fine. Maybe for you,
this is the grand finale, but for her,

457
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,700
it's the beginning, and this beginning
is not fair. It just isn’t.

No. You say your life is about

No. What I'm saying is that

480
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,120
betrayal doesn't depend on how much
or deeply you love someone.

481
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,450
It depends on the magnitude
of the dilemma put in front of you.

482
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,700
Would you... Would you betray
your loved one? At first, no.

483
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,370
But what would happen
if someone told you if you did

484
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,750
you'd be given a medicine
that could cure your beloved brother?

Do you deserve to spend

from the arrest of Murillo.

Alberto, your ex.

598
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,200
He's not just the best at what he does.
He also really wants

599
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,040
to fuck up your life a little more.

But there's another option.

601
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,330
I could get in the ambulance before him,

before anyone else,
and get rid of all the evidence.

613
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,160
Hey, Gandía,
now that we're both on the same side,

614
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,450
may I ask you a question?
I'm a little confused.

615
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Are we...

616
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,120
the good guys or the bad guys?

617
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm gonna make a little cut
in your scrotum, pull out your balls,

618
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,290
and then stuff them both in your mouth.

619
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,000
That sounds fun.

620
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,660
But your hands are still tied up, Che.

621
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,540
Did you know
that the reliability of handcuffs

622
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,000
is based upon
one single anatomical concept?

623
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,370
The metacarpus doesn't let them through.

624
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,160
But actually, it's a joint
that's very easy to dislocate.

625
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,540
Is that right?
