1
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:05,006
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,279
<i>After five years in hell...</i>

3
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,638
<i>I returned home
with only one goal...</i>

4
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,223
<i>to save my city.</i>

5
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:18,311
<i>For eight years, I've fought
alongside brave men and women</i>

6
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:19,604
<i>striving forjustice,</i>

7
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,731
<i>but then a Crisis came,</i>

8
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,942
<i>and I had to become
someone else.</i>

9
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,736
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

10
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,489
<i>I made the ultimate sacrifice,</i>

11
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,367
<i>which helped birth
an entirely new universe.</i>

12
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:36,454
<i>Now my friends and family
will have to go on without me,</i>

13
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,915
<i>and although I have become
a Spectre,</i>

14
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,417
<i>there is a part of me
that will always be</i>

15
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,794
<i>the Green Arrow.</i>

16
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:53,346
<i>Both my children will live.</i>

17
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,104
Mom...
what are you doing?

18
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,065
- Thea, I love you.
- No.

19
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,441
Close your eyes, baby.

20
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,608
No!

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,406
You possess
true courage, Moira.

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,120
I'm truly sorry...

23
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,919
you did not pass
that on to your son.

24
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,683
It's just such
a strange thing to learn

25
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,185
that there's a whole other...

26
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,733
world, I guess...

27
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,403
where I died.

28
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,033
<i>The people that knew
my son best tell me</i>

29
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:59,787
<i>that when Oliver sacrificed
himself during the Crisis,</i>

30
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:05,877
that somehow he's the reason
that everything changed,

31
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,882
that the world we're living in
right now is

32
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,343
a kind of gift from him.

33
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:20,808
I don't know.
I'm just trying to process it.

34
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,272
<i>I... I think we're all
still trying to process it,</i>

35
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,068
not only Oliver's death...

36
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,281
but what he leaves behind.

37
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:38,660
It's a hell of a legacy.

38
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,954
Not just a city of heroes,

39
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,249
<i>a world of heroes.</i>

40
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,771
<i>When I started this project,</i>

41
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:51,506
<i>it was intended to explore
the history</i>

42
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:54,592
<i>and the pitfalls
of vigilantism in Star City.</i>

43
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,306
I never thought this documentary
would have to be retooled

44
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:01,766
to be a memorial.

45
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,061
<i>Nothing really ever, um,</i>

46
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:08,064
<i>happens the way you expect it
to happen,</i>

47
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,276
and that was, uh,
certainly the case...

48
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,489
with Oliver and his mission.

49
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,618
He always said he would
go it alone

50
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,813
and that the mission
would never...

51
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,166
be over.

52
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:32,630
I'm glad he was... wrong
about the first part...

53
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:38,386
heartbroken he was wrong
about the second.

54
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,264
Thank you.

55
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,268
That was very moving.

56
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:49,646
Yeah.

57
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,697
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, man.

58
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,281
You all right?

59
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:00,616
Everything good.

60
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,704
Why do I get the sense
that answer disappoints you?

61
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:08,082
I just can't believe it.

62
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,670
Let's go.

63
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,970
When Oliver
rebooted the universe,

64
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,222
he fixed things.

65
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,516
Ever since the Crisis,

66
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:30,021
crime in Star City
disappeared overnight

67
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:31,773
literally.

68
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:38,654
Dig, he... he saved
this city.

69
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,699
Yeah.

70
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:45,870
Come on. It's time.

71
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:49,707
<i>Prochnost.</i>

72
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,712
Ugh. I didn't know
you speak Russian.

73
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,199
No. That's what Oliver
used to say

74
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,524
every time he drank
this stuff.

75
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,634
- What exactly is this stuff?
- Vodka.

76
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,135
Yeah. It tastes
like turpentine.

77
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,970
With faint hints
of nail polish remover.

78
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,681
So what's
the plan?

79
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,975
I plan on getting
as drunk

80
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,685
as humanly possible.

81
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,063
No. I mean
after the funeral.

82
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,147
From what Dinah
tells me,

83
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,317
there's not much need
for vigilantes anymore.

84
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,319
Lance's term ends in April.

85
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,905
He's endorsing me
to replace him.

86
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,533
- As mayor?
- No. As a bald guy with an attitude.

87
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,699
Yeah, as mayor.

88
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,409
What about you, D?

89
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,539
Mayor, uh... for now at least...
Lance actually

90
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,124
just offered me a promotion
to Chief of Police.

91
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,086
Guys, look. I know
how this looks.

92
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,193
I just don't feel like this is over.

93
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,049
Yeah. You're not reading
the same comstat reports I am.

94
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,093
We're a month out of
this Crisis, Dinah,

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,160
and there's tons
that we don't know,

96
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,931
what I do know is this.

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,853
Though Oliver's gone, his mission

98
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,604
is far from over.

99
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,196
Finally. What the hell
happened?

100
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,740
Jimmy Tarallo gave me
a few problems.

101
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,118
And by a few, you mean a dozen men
armed with knives?

102
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,246
No.
I mean 22 with machetes.

103
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,182
Queen, you shouldn't
be doing this alone.

104
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,684
You're not ready to go
into the field, Diggle.

105
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,834
Yeah? Well, when
I signed on,

106
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,921
I told you I was here to keep
the body count low.

107
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,296
That includes you.

108
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:19,588
Well, I'm fine.

109
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,047
And Tarallo?

110
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,092
A little less so.

111
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:29,723
What's this?

112
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,167
The next name on the list.

113
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,520
John Byrne?
What's the CEO of a beer company

114
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,647
have to do to deserve an arrow
between the eyes?

115
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:38,065
Well, the company's
a front.

116
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,650
He's using his trucks
to ferry

117
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,611
a very different type
of commodity.

118
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:42,944
Drugs?

119
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,155
People.

120
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,659
Human trafficking?
Where does this end?

121
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:49,845
How many names are
on your list?

122
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,454
Too many to cross off.
Listen, Diggle.

123
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,414
This doesn't end.

124
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,000
The mission is
never over.

125
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,221
You can
survive this,

126
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:12,934
make it home,
right my wrongs,

127
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,413
but you got to live
through this first.

128
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,863
Survive.

129
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,489
No!

130
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,336
- Hey.
- What the frak?

131
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,630
Sorry. I... I didn't mean
to scare you.

132
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,632
I meant to time portal
to your front door,

133
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,677
but I guess I... I overshot
the mark a bit.

134
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,345
This is a... this is
a nice room.

135
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,846
Time portal?

136
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,498
Yeah. I'm a time traveler,
remember?

137
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,729
Right. Okay.
Um, and why did you time travel here?

138
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,857
Because I'm here to take
you to your father's funeral.

139
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,996
You know,
I actually should have tried that sooner.

140
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,288
It's not
that hard, actually.

141
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,916
That's because your
arms are the size of telephone poles.

142
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,085
You doing okay?

143
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,337
When am I never
not okay?

144
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,756
I don't think any of us
are really okay,

145
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:29,260
but it seems to be hitting
you particularly hard.

146
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,345
I'm fine, like always.

147
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,472
You ready?

148
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,642
- Yeah. Let's do this.
- Yeah.

149
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,353
So what did Oliver
call this thing?

150
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,189
He called it
the Mark of Four.

151
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,277
So how you doing?

152
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,740
Uh, I'm just... I'm nervous
about the funeral.

153
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,490
Yeah.

154
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,452
Yeah. You know,
Thea's gonna be there.

155
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,997
Imagine both of Oliver's
sisters would be there.

156
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,208
I kind of left Thea abruptly.

157
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,295
Ah. You're worried
about an awkward reunion.

158
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,047
I'm worried about
any kind of reunion.

159
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,067
Well, hey.
Look at it this way.

160
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,134
After fighting
the Mirakuru soldiers

161
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,886
and the Thanatos Guild,

162
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,138
seeing your ex-girlfriend
should be cake.

163
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,639
That's why I'm scared.

164
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,144
I don't want her to
be my ex-girlfriend.

165
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,857
So when's
Felicity get to town?

166
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,193
I don't know
if she's coming.

167
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,403
It's her husband's
funeral, man.

168
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,410
Which is exactly why
I think she might miss it.

169
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,865
I don't know, Rene.

170
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,495
She has a nanny watching
Mia right now.

171
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,221
Felicity hasn't even
made it out of bed.

172
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,917
I have no idea
how to help her.

173
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,004
At least bring me
for backup.

174
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,191
How many times
are we gonna go over this, Diggle?

175
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,935
You know, I went
through Byrne's financials.

176
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,444
Every month, he gives
over a million dollars

177
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,553
to this outfit
called Black Armada.

178
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,056
- You know who they are?
- Private security firm.

179
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,267
- Former special forces.
- That's right,

180
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,434
and you don't think
it's a good idea to bring

181
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,812
a former soldier
of your own?

182
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:04,813
No.

183
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,564
You know
what I think?

184
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:08,960
I don't think you
really want me there.

185
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,569
Oh. Thanks for finally
getting my point.

186
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,214
I don't think you want me there
because you're afraid

187
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,278
I will stop you from committing
cold-blooded murder.

188
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,115
You think that your role is to keep
the body count low.

189
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,610
There's a way you can stop him
tonight without killing him.

190
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,038
You could take him
to prison,

191
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,026
you could see that
justice is served.

192
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,006
The man traffics
in human beings.

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,261
- Killing him is justice.
- But at what cost?

194
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,531
You say your mission will never end.
Well, trust me,

195
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,307
it will end a lot sooner
if you lose who you are.

196
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,443
Mia?

197
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,918
Don't worry. The Monitor
didn't drop me off

198
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,533
because there's
another Crisis coming.

199
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,952
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

200
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,317
Laurel's sister showed up,

201
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,331
thought I might enjoy going to
my dad's funeral.

202
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,085
And what are you doing
with all this stuff?

203
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,630
Trying my best
to channel my mom.

204
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,843
Sorry. Um, when Sara
dropped me off,

205
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,179
she gave me this whole lecture
about not telling people

206
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,680
about the future,
so...

207
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,685
Few weeks before
Sara showed up...

208
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,022
something happened.

209
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,026
William!

210
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:37,489
Right in front of me.
I couldn't do anything to stop it, and...

211
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,703
I am already failing at being
the Green Arrow.

212
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,998
What we do is
not easy.

213
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,959
There are setbacks,
there are tragedies,

214
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,878
but, God, Mia,
your father,

215
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,673
he would be so,
so proud

216
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,801
of how you're carrying
all of that.

217
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,221
I can't even do
the one thing that

218
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,972
he risked his
entire life to do...

219
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,351
protect my family.

220
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,688
What's this?

221
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,790
Well, your mother's
Archer protocol scans

222
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,568
news stations for
certain key words.

223
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,036
<i>William Clayton, the son of
the late hero Oliver Queen,</i>

224
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,914
<i>was abducted tonight
in his hometown of Central City.</i>

225
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,874
<i>The police have been
unable to confirm</i>

226
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,001
<i>any suspects
in the kidnapping.</i>

227
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,018
- Hey.
- Hey.

228
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,939
Look. I'm sorry
about the way that I left.

229
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,106
I just...

230
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,067
Ollie's just passed away,

231
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,610
and William's been
kidnapped,

232
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,363
so... as far
as apologies go,

233
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,323
your timing's
a little not great.

234
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,618
If you still think
Oliver's mission's finished,

235
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,675
tell that to William
when we get him back.

236
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,872
We will get him back,
but, John, William

237
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,874
was kidnapped outside
of Star City.

238
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,001
I'm sure that'll make him feel
a whole lot better.

239
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,838
- I reached out to Felicity.
- Yeah. Me, too.

240
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,047
Radio silence.

241
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,217
I asked Sara
to check on her.

242
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,142
Ah. I haven't seen this many people
down here in a while.

243
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,561
Hey.

244
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,358
Hey.

245
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,614
It's almost like a party.

246
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,958
Um, I tried
running a quad-grid search task

247
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,185
to a keyhole satellite
array, but...

248
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,479
That array's dark-sided
as it undergoes a firmware upgrade,

249
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,503
but fortunately when
William moved to Central City,

250
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,717
his overbearing stepmom implanted
a subdermal tracking device into his arm.

251
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,552
Ethical... debatable.

252
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,179
Which went dark as soon as
he reentered Star City.

253
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,890
Well, that's
convenient at least.

254
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,417
Just one second as I work up
a statistically correlated list

255
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,999
of possible locations
he could be at.

256
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,979
That is a very long list.

257
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,398
Which is exactly why
we called everyone.

258
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,097
Thank you all
for coming,

259
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,737
some on very short notice.

260
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,476
Oliver made
the ultimate sacrifice

261
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,743
for his friends
and his family.

262
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,580
Now a part of his family
needs our help.

263
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,625
This is our
most important mission.

264
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,127
Suit up.

265
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,683
Okay. Well, he's not here.

266
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,561
What was the next place
on Felicity's list?

267
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,813
Kord industries.

268
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,523
All right. Well, let's go.

269
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,108
Hey. Can I talk
to you for a second?

270
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,653
You already did
back at the bunker, okay? I...

271
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,947
I get it. You're sorry.

272
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,324
No. I never told
you why I left.

273
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,909
And you don't need to.

274
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,246
I understand.
You were going through a lot.

275
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,665
Dying, getting
resurrected,

276
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,377
it gave me a whole new perspective
on... on everything,

277
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,838
including you.

278
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,966
You know, I got
my whole life back,

279
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,093
and I realized that
I wanted you in it...

280
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,182
forever and...
and always.

281
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,018
And what does that mean?

282
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,436
It means...

283
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,189
will you marry me?

284
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,483
Uh...

285
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,823
Get out.

286
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,452
Get out!

287
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,763
- What the hell is that thing?
- Get outta here!

288
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,622
- Come on. Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go!

289
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,332
Ahh.

290
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,087
Nice. I would have
fired some shots in the air.

291
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,839
My way's scarier.

292
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,759
So, how are things?

293
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,345
It's been a while.

294
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,142
Yeah. Well, a while
is what it took

295
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,060
for these rags
to work again.

296
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,439
Since then, I've been
fighting for justice.

297
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,191
To honor your father?

298
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,776
To honor Oliver.

299
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,197
We've had our differences
over the years.

300
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,573
Yeah, I assumed.

301
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,074
Why?

302
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,245
Of everyone,

303
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,832
you're the most like him.

304
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,178
- Clear!
- Clear!

305
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,513
Damn it!

306
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:54,889
What?

307
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,724
He's not here.

308
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,369
Curtis said there's
a bunch of places he could still be.

309
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,913
- Well, we need to find him.
- We will.

310
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,438
We have to find
him, Johnny.

311
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,898
We will, Lyla.
Are you okay?

312
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,943
Oliver put our family
back together.

313
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,445
What happens if...

314
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,074
if we can't do the same for his?

315
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,700
Lyla, look at me.
We can,

316
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,995
and we will, I promise.

317
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,414
We will.

318
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,262
Let him go!

319
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,271
Who the hell are you?

320
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,322
I said, who are you?

321
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,866
You're wearing his hood.
You should know.

322
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,717
No, please, please.

323
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:56,548
Agh!

324
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,717
Unh!

325
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:01,886
You stay back!

326
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,638
John Byrne...

327
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,267
you have failed this city.

328
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,356
Let him go!

329
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,817
I brought him up here
to throw him off.

330
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,320
My whole life ended
right here!

331
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,615
I don't care!
Final warning.

332
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,117
He thought he was
saving me.

333
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,787
eight years in Iron Heights
never saved anyone.

334
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,205
So you kidnap his son,

335
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,040
the man who spared
your life?

336
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,083
I should put this arrow
in you right now!

337
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,586
Do it! After eight years
in prison,

338
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,005
I got nothing left
to live for anyway!

339
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:38,923
Go ahead!

340
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,437
No.

341
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:55,899
Oliver Queen
didn't kill you,

342
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,192
then neither will I,

343
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,570
but your ass is going
back to prison.

344
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,700
This is the riser,

345
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,410
uh, this is the arrow shelf,

346
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,662
and this is the fadeout.

347
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,400
That's really cool.

348
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,210
That's...

349
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,297
Mia.

350
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,635
Must be a lot
to take in.

351
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,011
Yeah. That's the...

352
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,848
understatement
of the millennium.

353
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,141
She became a hero.

354
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,227
Well, she had
good parents.

355
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,816
Do you... you want
to meet her?

356
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
I don't know.

357
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,530
She... she might
be here,

358
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,116
but she's... she's
also at home,

359
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:49,995
waiting for me,

360
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,082
and I get to see
her grow up.

361
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,632
I'm not sure I want
to rush that.

362
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,220
- Hey.
- Hey.

363
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,077
Something on the news
you should see.

364
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,139
What?

365
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,358
<i>William Clayton
was safely recovered</i>

366
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,319
<i>from his kidnapper John Byrne.</i>

367
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,613
<i>Apparently the abduction
was revenge</i>

368
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,199
<i>for Oliver Queen bringing
Byrne to justice eight years ago.</i>

369
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,827
<i>We have exclusive footage
of the rescue.</i>

370
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,920
<i>With Oliver Queen
confirmed dead,</i>

371
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,797
<i>we can only speculate
that he inspired</i>

372
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:47,302
<i>a new generation of heroes
to carry on his mission.</i>

373
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,724
Like I said... proud.

374
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,615
Diggle!

375
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,828
Don't use
just your arms.

376
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,248
Power's coming
from your hips.

377
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,339
Thanks for the tip.

378
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,257
Just get real good
at that,

379
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,464
and maybe I'll eventually
take you out in the field.

380
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,724
Byrne didn't really
have a good night, did he?

381
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,186
He had a better night
than you think.

382
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,734
He's being arraigned
in the morning.

383
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:46,944
Hmm.

384
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,573
Plenty of people in this book that
deserve to die,

385
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:52,783
plain and simple,

386
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,495
probably not
everyone.

387
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,041
Let's consider
Mr. John Byrne to be

388
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,086
proof of concept.

389
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,005
That people can be
redeemed?

390
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,257
That one day I'll be
able to trust you.

391
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,404
Your mom let me in.

392
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,365
Is it just me,
or does the new Moira

393
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,367
seem to like me a lot more than
the old Moira?

394
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:37,579
Yeah. She never really
liked you that much,

395
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,498
but in her defense,
you were a criminal.

396
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:41,875
Well, I regret nothing.

397
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,793
If I never stole
your purse,

398
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,200
then I never
would have met you,

399
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,256
and even if you do
say no to my proposal,

400
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,092
which I... I really hope
you don't...

401
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,930
loving you has changed
my life, Thea.

402
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,267
If Ollie's death has
taught me anything, it's...

403
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,229
that we don't have a lot of time
in this life.

404
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,901
As long as you promise

405
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,070
if you ever freak out
on me like that again,

406
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,239
you tell me instead
of just leaving.

407
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,992
Yeah, yeah.
I... I can make that promise.

408
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,161
Then yes.

409
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,205
Yes?

410
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,084
I will marry you,
Roy Harper.

411
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,934
Hey. What are you
doing here?

412
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,142
Looking for you.

413
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,686
Well, I was just
looking for Dinah.

414
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,897
I think she's, uh,
ghosting me.

415
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,565
Do you have a second
to talk?

416
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,276
Want to step
into not my office?

417
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,327
So, uh, what's up?

418
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:01,746
It's about Oliver.

419
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,040
Well, not
exactly him, but...

420
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,710
who his sacrifice
brought back.

421
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,798
- Like me?
- And Tommy and Moira...

422
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,136
but not me

423
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,848
or the other
me, your...

424
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:22,975
your Laurel.

425
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,499
Look. We don't exactly
know the rules

426
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,841
of this whole
resurrection thing.

427
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:26,937
Yes, we do.

428
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,023
You're all of
the people who Oliver

429
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,276
would have wanted
his sacrifice to bring back,

430
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,361
and Laurel, she...

431
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,052
she would have been
on that list, too,

432
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,492
if it wasn't for me.

433
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,997
Oliver's death, it
fixed everything else.

434
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,167
Why didn't it fix
this, too?

435
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,754
Because, sweetheart,
there is nothing about you

436
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,256
that needed
to be fixed.

437
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,597
All right.

438
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,437
Dig, what's going on?

439
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,611
The end of the line.

440
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,972
You were right.
The mission's over.

441
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,657
Just took me a while
to accept that.

442
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,762
I think accepting that
meant accepting

443
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,246
that Oliver is
really gone.

444
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,961
You know, Sara said
that before Oliver died

445
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,504
that he became
something else.

446
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,883
I'd like to think
that somehow, someway,

447
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:39,928
he's still here.

448
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,387
I'd drink to that.

449
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,681
Just as long as it's no more
of that God-awful vodka.

450
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,688
Okay. Cool. So...
you're moving on.

451
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:51,855
So what's next
for you?

452
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,108
Lyla accepted a promotion
in Metropolis, so...

453
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,087
we're all gonna move
there after the funeral.

454
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,279
So am I.

455
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,200
I'm not gonna take
the promotion.

456
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,828
Just no point being police
in a safe city,

457
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,499
and there are lots
of cities that still need saving.

458
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,791
Damn.

459
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,128
And here I am getting
to be elected in a few months,

460
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,464
and you guys decide to move away.

461
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,092
Kind of hard not to
take that personally.

462
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,095
Don't worry, Rene.
You are gonna be a great mayor

463
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,180
because you're
a great man.

464
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,015
I learned
from the best.

465
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,517
Oliver.

466
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:30,436
And the two
of you.

467
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:40,947
Who's getting
the lights?

468
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,531
I will.

469
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,056
I'm gonna miss
this place.

470
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,143
We all will.

471
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,954
Thank you for coming.

472
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,791
For a long time...

473
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:37,920
I hated Oliver Queen.

474
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:43,801
I blamed him for the death
of my youngest daughter,

475
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,890
I blamed him for the violence
in my city,

476
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,728
I interrogated him,
I hunted him,

477
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,272
persecuted him.

478
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,110
I've never been
more wrong in my life.

479
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,572
Oliver Queen wasn't just a hero.

480
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,993
He was a good man.

481
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,080
He was an honorable person.

482
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,221
The fact that he didn't
start out that way

483
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,834
makes him, in my book,

484
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,921
even more honorable.

485
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:24,092
He stands as a reminder
to all of us

486
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:26,928
that anyone can change.

487
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,683
So will this.

488
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,644
I just don't
understand.

489
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,563
If Ollie could
fix everything,

490
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,148
then why couldn't
he fix this?

491
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:26,362
I think that Oliver
could only change the things

492
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,072
that didn't change him,

493
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,159
and if not
for your father and...

494
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,829
what he did for Oliver,

495
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:39,792
your brother would never
have become the man that he was.

496
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,297
I still can't believe
Ollie's really gone.

497
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,424
I know, sweetheart.

498
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,597
I'm sorry to intrude,

499
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,433
but I wanted to meet you.

500
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,643
- I'm...
- My sister.

501
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,104
Oliver told me a lot
about you.

502
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,981
I'm sorry that it took
something like this

503
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,148
for us to
finally meet.

504
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:07,403
Yes. Emiko, you are
welcome here anytime.

505
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,070
Thank you.

506
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,995
So you're from
another Earth, is that it?

507
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,831
I know it's a lot
to take in.

508
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,643
Well, I just found out
there's a reality where I was dead,

509
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,170
so that's the curve I'm
grading on these days.

510
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:31,052
The Laurel of, well,
this Earth, um...

511
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,638
she was my wife.

512
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,059
So it must be
strange seeing me.

513
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:42,271
Ho! Yeah. Well, strange
enough to blow the curve...

514
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,442
but there's something
nice about it, too.

515
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,577
My condolences
on your husband's passing.

516
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,829
I had our marriage
erased.

517
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,582
Feelings cannot
be erased.

518
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,376
I had no feelings
for him.

519
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,045
Our marriage was
Father's perverse joke,

520
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,047
meant to torment me.

521
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:12,051
Our father only ever
meant for you to have a normal life.

522
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,012
I have lived a life
far more normal

523
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,973
than the one father
designed for me.

524
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,519
Hey. Thank you
for coming.

525
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,271
There's nowhere
else I'd be.

526
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,651
Sara, this is
my sister Talia.

527
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,111
- Hi.
- Hello.

528
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,071
Talia, this is
Sara,

529
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,030
my beloved.

530
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,451
Hey, Dad.

531
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:47,627
Hi.

532
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,046
Oh. Hi.

533
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,215
- I'm...
- I know.

534
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,344
This morning,
you were teething,

535
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,223
and now you're...
I mean, wow.

536
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,811
Dad had a very similar
reaction when he first saw me.

537
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,189
You met your father.

538
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,026
Yeah. He trained me.

539
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,279
He taught me
to be a hero,

540
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,740
how to be like him.

541
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:18,200
I can tell you're
a lot like him.

542
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,329
I can only hope.

543
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:31,671
Felicity.

544
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:34,467
Hey.

545
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,760
I'm so sorry.

546
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,429
He was a good man.

547
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,474
I was there
at the end, and...

548
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:44,870
every day, I'm tortured
with the thought

549
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:45,978
that I could have
done more,

550
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,606
should have
done more.

551
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,943
No. You did everything
that you could, Barry.

552
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:54,362
How could you
know that?

553
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,614
Well, because,
you know, I know you.

554
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,242
I'm sorry.

555
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,123
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

556
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,545
Felicity.

557
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,465
I'm so sorry.

558
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,259
There is no body
down there, no?

559
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,593
No.

560
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,721
We buried a casket
full of mementos.

561
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,599
Does anybody wanna say a few words?

562
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,976
I'm barely keeping it
together as it is.

563
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,788
I think that Oliver would
have been worried

564
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,855
that I'd say something
tactless anyway, so...

565
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,776
- I don't know what to say.
- Yeah.

566
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,864
Words seem...
meaningless.

567
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,033
Hey.

568
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:44,954
Should be you.

569
00:36:58,509 --> 00:36:59,969
The Oliver that I met
eight years ago

570
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:02,680
is not the one that we say
good-bye to today.

571
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:08,269
Oliver always told me
that in order to save his city,

572
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,146
he had to become someone else,

573
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:11,939
he had to become
something else.

574
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:15,544
I always thought that meant
becoming the Green Arrow,

575
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:20,156
but... today, I realized
that meant becoming

576
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,241
a better man,

577
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,327
the best man he knew
how to be,

578
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:31,250
and he took all of us
with him on that journey.

579
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:33,961
He changed everything.

580
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:36,898
Oliver brought heroes
into the world,

581
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:37,882
he inspired heroes,

582
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:41,011
he inspired all of us here.

583
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:44,972
I was his brother,

584
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:50,770
and Oliver Queen...
was mine.

585
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,108
<i>Of course, life will go on.</i>

586
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,114
<i>It always does,</i>

587
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:08,454
<i>but how, what twists
and turns it will take,</i>

588
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:09,663
<i>I can't say.</i>

589
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,752
<i>I don't know
what the future holds...</i>

590
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:27,348
<i>except to say to expect
the unexpected.</i>

591
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,320
<i>Oliver may be gone,</i>

592
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,532
<i>but his mission endures.</i>

593
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,119
<i>That mission lives on,</i>

594
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:50,830
<i>Oliver lives on</i>

595
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,540
<i>in the people he inspired.</i>

596
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,462
<i>Some will take that mission
to the rest of the world...</i>

597
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,135
<i>maybe even beyond that...</i>

598
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,814
<i>because if the past eight years
has shown us anything...</i>

599
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,237
<i>it's that this universe is far bigger</i>

600
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:28,534
<i>than any of us
could have dared imagine...</i>

601
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:36,584
even if it is
a little less bright

602
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,545
without him in it.

603
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,021
<i>Where I'm taking you,</i>

604
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:58,898
there is no return.

605
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,317
I have waited
a very long time to see him.

606
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:04,402
I'm ready.

607
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,057
Hi.

608
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,229
Glad you could
finally make it.

609
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,298
This is so nice.

610
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:50,917
Not to complain.
I just thought

611
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,654
that the afterlife would
look a little less

612
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:53,804
like your old office.

613
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,849
It's my mom's office.

614
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,436
I wanted to be
where I first saw you.

615
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:04,189
Well, that would be
in the IT Department seven floors down.

616
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,357
You sure?

617
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,695
You're cute.

618
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,533
Too bad you're,
you know, dead,

619
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,037
which is obviously
a lot worse for you than it is for me.

620
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:20,831
It's a long story.

621
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,047
Lucky for us...

622
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,360
we have all the time
in the world

623
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,719
for me to tell it
to you.

624
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:24,019
Greg, move your head!
