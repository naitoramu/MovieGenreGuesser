1
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:01,980
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:03,415
So my brother's
a Ghost?

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:04,862
10 years ago, I found
out you were dealing.

4
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:07,463
Yeah. You convinced
me to enlist.

5
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:09,196
John, voice-over: You saw what kind
of man my brother was,

6
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:10,764
what kind of man he is.

7
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,266
He's your family.
You said he was a good man.

8
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,534
Maybe part of him
still is.

9
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:14,868
I don't know.

10
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,071
Get down.

11
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:22,076
The damage
to her spinal cord, it's permanent.

12
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:23,877
She's never gonna
walk again.

13
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,015
If we don't get
home soon,

14
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:30,184
the sitter's gonna
charge us an extra hour.

15
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:31,919
We should have
taken the car.

16
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:35,789
Sitter's what, another 15 bucks
for half an hour?

17
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,125
It's a bargain
at twice the price.

18
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:42,796
Lyla.

19
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:44,698
- Dear God.
- Alan?

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,233
Sorry to crash
your evening.

21
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:47,601
Then don't. Just call
like normal people.

22
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:49,169
I don't have
a normal job,

23
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:50,471
and I've been compromised.

24
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:51,805
I'm not Argus
anymore.

25
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,440
Which makes you
the only person I can trust.

26
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:54,975
I need you to
tell Waller--

27
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,243
Get down!

28
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:00,247
-You're hit!
-Ugh.

29
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:03,650
Alan!

30
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:17,698
Unh!

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,833
Johnnie!

32
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,602
Are you ok?

33
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,803
You were right.

34
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,238
We should have taken
the car.

35
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,239

Just be careful.
Slow down, slow down.

38
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:34,481
Careful, careful, careful.

39
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:36,250
Do you want me
to be careful?

40
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:38,418
Oh, this is more
Oliver 2.0, isn't it?

41
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,654
You think being cute
is gonna distract me?

42
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,856
Mission
accomplished.

43
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:44,458
You don't
have to wait on me

44
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,126
hand and foot,

45
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:48,295
though I wouldn't say
no to a blanket.

46
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:50,464
The doctor says
stick

47
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:52,199
with the two tablets

48
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,634
to keep with your
current

49
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:56,436
pain management
regimen.

50
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,005
You know, I really
appreciate what you're doing,

51
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,406
but you have
a city to save,

52
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,008
a mayoral campaign,

53
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,476
a freaky superbad
who can move things

54
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:03,677
with his mind.

55
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,013
None of which are
nearly as important

56
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:07,514
as your recovery.

57
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:08,682
Thank you.

58
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:10,117
I think the people
in the city

59
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,618
that Darhk wants to
destroy might disagree.

60
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,886
Well, those people
should know that

61
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,354
I stand no chance
of stopping Damien Darhk

62
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:15,455
without your help.

63
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:18,225
Well, you might
have to.

64
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:19,893
I have a spinal cord injury.

65
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:23,664
I might never make
a full recovery ever.

66
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,566
That is worst case
scenario,

67
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:26,900
and either way,
you are still

68
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:28,502
a vital member
of the team.

69
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:33,640
Your superpower
is right there.

70
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,442
Maybe my new code name
could be Hot Wheels.

71
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:39,079
Keep pitching on that.

72
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,614
All jokes aside,

73
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:41,915
like you said,

74
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:43,350
what I do bring
to the team is my mind,

75
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:45,686
and there's a lot
on it.

76
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,387
So talk to me.

77
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,156
I just don't think
I'm ready to come back yet,

78
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:50,591
and the last thing
you need

79
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:52,559
in a life-or-limb
situation is me.

80
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,494
Wow. We are going to
agree to disagree

81
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:56,263
on that one
for the moment.

82
00:02:58,467 --> 00:02:59,433
What's going on?

83
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:00,901
John and Lyla
were attacked.

84
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:02,202
Oh, my God!
Are they ok?

85
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:03,737
John was shot.
It was a flesh wound.

86
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,205
I should go see them.

87
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:06,940
We should go see them.

88
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,543
Nice try.

89
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:10,744
Dinner is in the fridge.

90
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:14,414
Reheat in the oven
at 425 degrees.

91
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,582
I love you.

92
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,950
I love you, too.

93
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:24,358
And they just
left you there?

94
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,093
Yeah, but not before
leaving me with this.

95
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:28,595
We are sure that
this wasn't HIVE?

96
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,530
These men looked
military.

97
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:32,432
Right, but you said that Chang
said he was compromised,

98
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:34,902
and he specifically told you
to go and speak with Waller.

99
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:36,203
Knowing her, she had
Alan working

100
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:38,038
on something
off the books.

101
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,139
I need to call
the sitter.

102
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:40,474
Ok.

103
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,075
We need to find
Chang before

104
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:43,777
this kidnapping
becomes something worse.

105
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,412
Yeah, well, the van didn't
have any plates on them,

106
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,381
and Chang's phone is
Argus-issued,

107
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:48,982
which means it will be
untraceable.

108
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:51,251
We could really use
Felicity's help right now.

109
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:53,553
Yeah. She's not
up for it yet.

110
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:55,956
I can have SCPD
see if John's bullet

111
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,591
is connected to any
open cases.

112
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:58,792
Yeah.

113
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:00,127
I can go check
the crime scene

114
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:02,963
for any leftover
evidence.

115
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,398
You should go
to Starling General

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,966
and have that
looked at.

117
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,234
I'll be fine.

118
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,802
Why? Because eating
a cheeseburger

119
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:10,237
is a better option?

120
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,639
This isn't for me.
It's for Andy.

121
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:20,447
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,850
Hey. What happened
to your arm?

123
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,552
Nothing. It's
an occupational hazard.

124
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:28,121
I never pegged you
for the masked vigilante type.

125
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:31,558
Yeah? Well, I guess
we're both full of surprises, Andy.

126
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,494
You know what?

127
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,696
You keep coming down here,

128
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:37,798
asking me
all these questions,

129
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,868
but I never get
to ask them back.

130
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,770
What do you want
to know?

131
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:47,140
Uh, how do you end up
working out of a basement

132
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,209
or wherever we are

133
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,278
and fighting crime
with a guy

134
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,612
who wears
a green hoodie?

135
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,014
Well, he's
a good man,

136
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,917
and we're not
fighting crime, Andy.

137
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,719
We're taking a city
that's holding itself together,

138
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,488
and we are helping.

139
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,390
Don't you remember
when that was your mission?

140
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:12,299
Appreciate you two
volunteering for this mission.

141
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:14,067
Chance to ride
with my little brother?

142
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,168
Wouldn't miss it.

143
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,503
Yeah. The Taliban's
not ready

144
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:17,838
for the Diggle brothers.

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,639
HQ's got eyes on
a primo opium shipment

146
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:21,375
that's been funding the local
arms trade.

147
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:23,176
We cut them off,
the terrorists

148
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:24,311
will be left
with nothing but

149
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:25,512
rocks and sticks
to fight us.

150
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:27,247
Copy that, sir.
You ready for this?

151
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,682
Yeah.

152
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:50,937
Incoming.
Stay frosty, boys.

153
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,105
Copy that.

154
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,445
RPG!

155
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:08,722
Perimeter!

156
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:10,757
Go! Go, go, go!

157
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,426
Move, move,
move, move, move!

158
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:17,597
We're screwed if
they come around the other side.

159
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,099
I'll see if I can
buy us some time.

160
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,467
Move, move.

161
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:24,538
I have to draw
them to it.

162
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,939
I got you.
I'll cover.

163
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:42,155
Come on,
come on, come on!

164
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:43,490
It's in!

165
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:47,094
Andy!

166
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,395
Hey!

167
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,371
Andy!

168
00:06:58,373 --> 00:06:59,406
Talk to me, man.

169
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,007
You ok?

170
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,242
Did we get them?

171
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:03,877
You got them, brother.
Let's go.

172
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:31,805
Aw. Why didn't I
get invited to this pity party?

173
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,040
Hello?

174
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,042
At least you found
the right party favors.

175
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,378
3 pills is a bit much,

176
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,547
but who am I to judge?

177
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:42,082
Ok. Whoever you are,
you picked

178
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:43,683
the wrong woman
on the wrong night to mess with.

179
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,685
Please.
We both know

180
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,120
you're in no position
to do anything.

181
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:49,222
If you did, you'd be
back out in the world

182
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,524
instead of holed up here.

183
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:53,560
Oh, my God.
What is going on?

184
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:55,162
What is going on?

185
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:58,965
Oh, my God. Ha ha!

186
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,600
Oh, my God.
I am losing it.

187
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:01,801
I am completely
and utterly losing it.

188
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:05,172
Agh! Now I'm talking
to myself.

189
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:06,640
Not exactly.

190
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:16,383
Laurel Lance,
district attorney's office.

191
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:17,751
What do we
have here?

192
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:20,253
Deceased male,
around 35, Asian,

193
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:22,522
multiple lacerations,
contusions,

194
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:23,590
and blunt force trauma.

195
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:24,925
You canvass
the area yet?

196
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:26,593
There could be
a witness who saw something.

197
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:29,829
I don't need an ADA to
tell me how to do my job.

198
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:31,364
Well, I'm sure
there's a murderer

199
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:34,167
out there who appreciates your
lack of initiative.

200
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:39,306
Ahem.

201
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,777
Go ahead.

202
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:47,247
Private security
found him

203
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:48,615
at the start of
a graveyard shift.

204
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:50,083
That's Chang.

205
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:51,585
Whoever did this
took their time.

206
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:53,320
Multiple lacerations
to the knees,

207
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,990
a broken arm,
at least 3 pulled fingernails.

208
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:59,292
They were torturing
him for something.

209
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:01,795
Information wasn't
the only thing they wanted.

210
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,204
I told you. What Agent Chang
was working on

211
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,481
is none of your concern,
and it's even less of yours.

212
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:15,181
Thought would change once you
found out Chang was mutilated,

213
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:17,083
tortured, and killed.

214
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:19,452
I'm afraid you've overextended
your welcome, Mr. Diggle.

215
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,153
Which is Argus-speak for
get the hell out of here.

216
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:23,889
You always were
a quick study.

217
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,391
I mean this
with all sincerity.

218
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:28,294
Your presence has
truly been missed.

219
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:31,564
Even if I don't show it,
I am deeply regretful

220
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:33,165
for Mr. Chang's death.

221
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,400
Hopefully we'll
meet again

222
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:36,569
under happier
circumstances.

223
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:37,903
Of course.

224
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:50,349
Hey. What was that
look all about?

225
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:55,763
"Ketorolac. Possible
side effects include

226
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,096
"swelling of the hands
and feet,

227
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,297
increased appetite,
risk of infection."

228
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,899
Oh, good, good, good.
Hallucinations.

229
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,835
I really thought
I was smarter than this.

230
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:06,172
You are not me,
and you're definitely not real.

231
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:07,640
I used to be you,

232
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:08,975
or you used to be me--

233
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:14,347
strong, confident,
brunette--

234
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:19,318
but you wasted
all that away to go play superhero,

235
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,621
and look where
that got you.

236
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:26,759
Ok. So wait.
This Waller person said

237
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,394
that she couldn't
tell you anything

238
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:29,962
and then gave you
that flash drive?

239
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:32,498
Argus has 24/7
internal surveillance.

240
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,833
She didn't want anyone
to know she was giving me

241
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,101
what she was giving me.

242
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:38,571
The question is
what did she give you?

243
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,106
I've seen
that symbol before.

244
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:41,574
It's a logo actually.

245
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:43,776
Shadowspire is a U.S. army
special forces unit.

246
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:45,478
Argus took them down
3 years ago

247
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,946
when they were exposed
as war profiteers

248
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:48,681
in an Op run
by Alan Chang.

249
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:50,650
What about those
other two guys?

250
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:52,518
They've been reported
missing for two days.

251
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,786
If those were
the missing agents

252
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,288
that were a part
of Shadowspire, then--

253
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,722
then the rest of Shadowspire
is gonna be

254
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,357
on a payback mission.

255
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,592
We need to find
the other two agents

256
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,594
before they end up
like Alan.

257
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:03,329
Hey. I think
I found something.

258
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,164
That logo that was on the flash drive
that Waller gave you.

259
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,599
Shadowspire.

260
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,334
I thought I recognized
that from someplace.

261
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:09,635
I ran into alot of those guys back
in the 'Stan.

262
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:11,471
I need to talk
to my brother again.

263
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,775
Who would think
the reward for confiscating

264
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:18,444
an opium shipment would be
additional duty guarding it?

265
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:21,614
What you expect,
a kiss from the president?

266
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,749
How are my two
conquering heroes?

267
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,017
Wet and tired.

268
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,519
We are good, sir.

269
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:27,753
You gentlemen
did good today.

270
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:28,955
Thank you, sir.

271
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,056
Ever think
about your future

272
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:31,224
beyond working
in this hell hole?

273
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:32,391
I don't know.

274
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,994
Personal security,
bodyguarding maybe.

275
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,196
You boys are meant
for better things.

276
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:41,334
The 3 of us could
make bank

277
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:43,202
if a few bricks of that sweet
Afghani powder

278
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:46,973
happened to go AWOL
before the morning.

279
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,308
You know, I'm gonna
have to decline, sir.

280
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,745
My mama taught me
never to trust dirty war profiteers.

281
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,521
You should probably
watch your tone.

282
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:02,855
You might end up
in worse shape than

283
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:04,757
those Talis
yesterday.

284
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,729
As you were.

285
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,570
- Well, look at you.
- What you talking about?

286
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,572
Back in Starling, you would have jumped
at any opportunity

287
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:22,375
to earn a little
extra scratch.

288
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:24,477
This place has been
good for you.

289
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,078
I'm proud of you, Andy.

290
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,049
So exactly how many
evil organizations

291
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,250
are you associated
with?

292
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,451
I'm beginning
to lose count.

293
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:35,087
What are you
talking about?

294
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,522
Shadowspire!

295
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,524
Your old army
buddies are in Starling City.

296
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:40,393
Have them to
thank for this.

297
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:43,429
They tortured and killed
an Argus agent

298
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,231
and abducted
two others.

299
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,033
Look. I have nothing
to do with them anymore.

300
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,068
After I got discharged,
they cut ties.

301
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,903
They only want
enlisted men.

302
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,805
How the hell could
I not see this?

303
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,674
You were with me
the entire time!

304
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:56,976
Because you saw
what you wanted to see.

305
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:58,511
Look. You wanted to believe
that the army

306
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,079
had straightened me out.

307
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,414
Look. I'm your brother,

308
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,249
but I'm not
built like you.

309
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,618
I didn't take to the military
like you did.

310
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,353
You saw the world
as something to be fixed.

311
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,555
I only saw it as broken,

312
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,123
so I made sure
I had enough

313
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,925
to survive in it.

314
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,394
So you pretended
to be

315
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,662
a completely
different person

316
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:19,332
around your
own brother?

317
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,934
It spared me the look that's
on your face right now.

318
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,706
But maybe some good
could come out of this.

319
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,107
Andy...

320
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,377
What are you
talking about?

321
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,511
The two missing agents--

322
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,679
you still think
they're alive?

323
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:35,848
- I can hope.
- And I can help.

324
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,018
Look. I know how
Shadowspire operates.

325
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,653
If they're consistent,
they'll use

326
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:44,090
the nearest freeport
as a base of operations.

327
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,691
The best place to hide
illicit things

328
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:48,327
is right next
to legitimate ones.

329
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,698
It's called
a freeport

330
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,133
it holds commodities
while they're in transit

331
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:56,035
between international
destinations.

332
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,136
Pretty low-end.

333
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:58,404
Looks like
somebody upgraded

334
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,538
their security system.

335
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,174
Motion sensors,
laser tripwires,

336
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,342
digital locks.

337
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,379
I think I know somebody
who can help.

338
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:12,351
Not gonna get that?

339
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:16,255
Smart move.

340
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:17,556
Oliver?

341
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,525
I'm out in
the field actually.

342
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,960
We've come up
against some tech,

343
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,561
the kind that you
typically eat for breakfast.

344
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,964
Now I know that you
said you're not

345
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,365
ready to get back
in the saddle,

346
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,034
but we could really
use your help.

347
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,536
You're not really falling
for that again, are you?

348
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:31,837
Where are you?

349
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,706
Pacific Freeport.
It's a--

350
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,341
security's down.

351
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:36,709
That was amazing.

352
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,844
All you need to
do is get back in the game.

353
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:41,914
I thought vomiting inside my mouth
was just an expression.

354
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:44,583
I'm inside their
security system.

355
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:47,486
I got eyes on 7
very menacing-looking fellows

356
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:50,356
guarding a bunch
of holding containers.

357
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,194
I'm reading
infrared on one of the containers.

358
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:56,896
I'm working on opening
that lock.

359
00:14:56,898 --> 00:15:00,032
Go for the hostages.
We'll take care of Shadowspire.

360
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,441
Container's open.
Should be 10 feet in front of you,

361
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:10,309
second container
on your right.

362
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,444
Got it.

363
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,285
We found
the two Argus agents.

364
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:20,486
They're both dead.

365
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:21,587
Get out of here then.

366
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:22,621
What about you
and Spartan?

367
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,123
We got this. Go!

368
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,299
Felicity, what's going on?

369
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:34,667
I don't know. I, um--

370
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,235
I must have tripped
some sort of failsafe.

371
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:38,170
The system's overloaded
with too many requests.

372
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,638
Oopsie.

373
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,054
You hear so much
about these vigilantes,

374
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:56,789
but I've never seen one
in person.

375
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,090
Wish I could say
the same about

376
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,292
a cold-blooded
murderer.

377
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,761
Have we met before?

378
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,303
Unh!

379
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,738
All right. Let's go.

380
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,107
I've got Spartan.
We're good!

381
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:17,476
No thanks to you.

382
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:27,904
Hey.

383
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:31,941
You ok?

384
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:33,643
That depends.

385
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:34,744
Is John ok?

386
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:37,447
John's fine,

387
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:39,949
but you seem to
think that

388
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:41,718
what happened
tonight is your fault.

389
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,386
Well, I'm pretty sure
I was the one

390
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,555
who couldn't stop
the security doors from closing.

391
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:47,257
And I'm the one
who pushed you to get involved

392
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,125
when you signaled
pretty hard that you weren't ready.

393
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:51,961
I wasn't signaling...

394
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:53,730
That hard.

395
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,765
I'm sorry that
I pushed.

396
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:58,334
I just thought that
if you got

397
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,103
behind a keyboard
again that things

398
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,572
would just start
to feel normal.

399
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:05,141
I love how playing superhero
is what we consider normal.

400
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:07,777
Heh.

401
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,746
But there is no going
back to normal.

402
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:10,980
You know what
I mean.

403
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:13,249
I know what you mean.

404
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:17,620
What I mean is that
I can no longer be a part of the team.

405
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:20,323
Because of your
injury?

406
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:22,325
You can't let that
stop you.

407
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,060
Except it has.

408
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:26,129
Look at me, Oliver.

409
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:28,298
I've spent the last week and a half
stuck in this loft.

410
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,302
I can't...move.
I can't drive.

411
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:33,936
I can't walk
down the street

412
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:35,972
and get a cup
of coffee,

413
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:38,074
and if tonight is
any indication,

414
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:41,477
I can't do the one thing
that I'm supposed to still be able to do.

415
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,479
You just need to
give it time.

416
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:50,386
Hey. Talk to me.

417
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:53,156
Go ahead. Tell him.

418
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:54,490
Tell him you're
hallucinating.

419
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,192
That should go over
like gangbusters.

420
00:17:56,194 --> 00:17:57,994
I'm not going
to pretend that I understand...

421
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:59,162
Come on, Felicity.
Tell him. Tell him...

422
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,630
What you're
going through,

423
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,665
but you are the strongest person
that I know...

424
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,667
That you're no good for the team anymore,
that in addition to having

425
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,336
legs that don't work,
you've got a full on case of the crazies...

426
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:08,338
And we have your back the same way that
you have our back.

427
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,006
We don't stand a chance
to take down those guards last night--

428
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:12,008
- seeing visions...
- Just shut up!

429
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,380
I didn't mean that.

430
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:18,815
I didn't mean
to upset you.

431
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:21,884
No, no, no.
It's not you, it's not you.

432
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:24,420
Can I just be alone
for a little while?

433
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,766
You know,
I guessed I hoped

434
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:38,234
by giving you Intel
on Shadowspire

435
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:40,603
you would, um, let
me out of my cell,

436
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:42,805
but this isn't what
I had in mine.

437
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,208
Hey, Lyla.
It's been a while.

438
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,676
Andy.

439
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:53,716
Mr. Diggle.

440
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,084
I'm the director of Argus.

441
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:57,253
Those 3 dead men
were my agents.

442
00:18:57,255 --> 00:19:00,256
I want to debrief you
on your relationship to Shadowspire.

443
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:01,524
Which is interesting
because you couldn't even

444
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:03,426
say Shadowspire
last time we met.

445
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:05,928
I was taking
an understandable precaution

446
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,531
in light of a potential
security breach.

447
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,266
The two agents
you found tonight

448
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:12,034
were assigned to
safeguard a shipment

449
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:13,469
of confiscated
railguns.

450
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,938
Heh.

451
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,375
But that was
a completely black assignment,

452
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:23,646
so I'd be very interested
to know how Shadowspire knew about it.

453
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,915
Amanda, you don't
see the bigger problem here?

454
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,217
Those things fire off
electromagnetic projectiles.

455
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,986
Just one of them could
take down a building.

456
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:32,355
- Your point?
- My point...

457
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,090
Is that if Shadowspire's
looking for that type of ordinance--

458
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:35,324
I'm far more
concerned

459
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:36,893
with a catastrophic
security breach

460
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:39,262
in my organization,
Mr. Diggle.

461
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:40,963
It doesn't matter.

462
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:43,099
Shadowspire's not
after railguns.

463
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:44,600
And what if you're
wrong, Andy?

464
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,102
We thought you
weren't hooked up

465
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:47,470
with Shadowspire
anymore.

466
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:50,006
I'm not, but I know
the way they work.

467
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,608
Shadowspire's all about
misdirection.

468
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,812
An elite military unit?

469
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:58,247
A cover for a criminal
organization.

470
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:01,384
A heist of a shipment
of railguns?

471
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,219
No.

472
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:05,421
Distraction.

473
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:07,190
They're
after something else.

474
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,198
You want to
talk about it?

475
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,499
What is there
to talk about?

476
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,301
Felicity's upset,

477
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,669
I don't know how
to help her.

478
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:22,839
It seems entirely
straightforward.

479
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,907
As the only other person
here who's had

480
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:27,376
the privilege of dating you,
a piece of advice.

481
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:29,879
Ok.

482
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:31,314
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

483
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:34,717
Everything that's
happening is my fault.

484
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,452
I knew you were
gonna say that.

485
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:39,489
Last month when we
went up against Vandal Savage,

486
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,357
Barry traveled
through time

487
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,692
and changed things.

488
00:20:42,694 --> 00:20:43,726
Uh, what?

489
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:45,294
Barry can travel
through time,

490
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:48,331
and he warned me
that when you change the past

491
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:52,535
the past fights back,
so for the past month,

492
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:57,173
I have been tortured
by the idea

493
00:20:57,175 --> 00:20:59,475
that what happened
to Felicity might have happened

494
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:00,810
because I wouldn't
listen to him.

495
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,845
The only person who
is responsible

496
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,747
for what happened
to Felicity

497
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:06,682
is Damien Darhk.

498
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:15,024
John.

499
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:17,226
We're on it.

500
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:18,427
John thinks
Shadowspire's going

501
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:19,829
after a shipment
of railguns.

502
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:22,965
- Can you call Thea?
- Got it.

503
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,635
Hey, Oliver.

504
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,137
Felicity--she makes
her own choices, you know.

505
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:32,542
I'm sure that's one of the reasons why
you love her so much.

506
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,910
Yeah.

507
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:38,281
Wow.

508
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,983
"The Shining."

509
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:45,121
Not sure if I
should be flattered or insulted.

510
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:47,924
Oh, my God. Die.
Just go away already.

511
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:49,692
Since I'm you,

512
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,261
that could be a little difficult,
don't you think?

513
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:58,334
Fine. I'm here, you're here,
so why are we here?

514
00:21:58,336 --> 00:21:59,969
Do you have anything
the least bit interesting to say to me

515
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:01,804
besides the little jabs
you keep making?

516
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:04,273
Those jabs are just to
get your attention.

517
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:05,942
So what do you
want to tell me?

518
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:07,577
I'm not here to tell
you anything.

519
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:11,113
I'm here to show you.

520
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:12,448
The last time we
looked like this,

521
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,950
Cooper had just
fake died.

522
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:15,551
What does this have
to do with my ex-boyfriend?

523
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:18,187
The day we thought
he died,

524
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:21,657
you broke out the hair dye,

525
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,393
ditched the contacts,
and decided

526
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:27,363
you weren't gonna rely
on anyone else for help

527
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,831
ever again.

528
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,766
It was just going to be
you against the world,

529
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,768
and that was going to
be your armor.

530
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,570
Guess I should have
chosen Kevlar.

531
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:37,640
Stop it. Stop feeling
sorry for yourself

532
00:22:37,642 --> 00:22:38,674
and stop pretending!

533
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:39,842
Pretending?!

534
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:42,244
Pretending that this
is the real you--

535
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:45,081
the blond hair,
the glasses,

536
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,949
the sensible
fashion.

537
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:48,651
People wear masks
for a reason--

538
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:50,419
to hide who
they are--

539
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:52,622
just like you have
been doing for the past 5 years.

540
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:53,990
First, you decided
to sign up for being

541
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:57,193
the world's most
overqualified I.T. girl,

542
00:22:57,195 --> 00:23:01,097
and then you decide
to try being a hero,

543
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:03,065
and look what
it got you,

544
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:07,136
a ringside seat
to the rest of your life.

545
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:09,639
You thought you were
such a badass.

546
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:19,448
Waller says
the shipment of railguns

547
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,050
is in the back
of that truck,

548
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:22,985
moving out in less
than an hour.

549
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:25,087
What does Shadowspire
want with a whole shipment

550
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:26,856
of railguns?

551
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:29,125
Absolutely nothing good.

552
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:32,728
It's nice to
have you back, Agent Michaels.

553
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,463
Feels like old times.

554
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:36,332
What feels like old times is you
keeping secrets

555
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:38,467
that get
good people killed.

556
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:40,269
Did it ever occur
to you that Alan

557
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,904
and the other two
agents might still be alive

558
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,305
if you hadn't tried
to keep your

559
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:45,274
anti-Shadowspire operations
off the books?

560
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:47,043
Of course it has,

561
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:48,678
but the ugly side
of our business

562
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,514
is that sometimes security has to be
paid for in blood.

563
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:56,118
Thank you.
I was wondering why I'd left.

564
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,520
I don't know what
you're worried about, man.

565
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:59,321
Your team's not
seeing action tonight.

566
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:02,024
And I'm not with them
because I'm here babysitting you.

567
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:08,064
Where are they?

568
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:11,934
Something's wrong.

569
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:31,687
There's no movement
on the railgun ship--

570
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:54,410
Amanda, it's been ages.

571
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:58,714
Lieutenant Joyner, wish I could say
it was a pleasure.

572
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,720
Oh, man.
Stop moving.

573
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:06,422
You are making
me dizzy.

574
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:14,163
Oh, my God.

575
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:15,731
I told you, John.

576
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:18,000
The railguns were
a distraction.

577
00:25:18,002 --> 00:25:20,636
Argus is
the endgame.

578
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,349
If this is retribution
for the work

579
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:29,116
Agent Chang and I did
crippling Shadowspire,

580
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:30,917
clearly it didn't take.

581
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:34,389
Vengeance and retribution
are useless pursuits.

582
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,725
For one thing,
they don't pay.

583
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:39,160
I'm here
for Rubicon,

584
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,428
and you--you're
gonna give me

585
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:41,629
the codes to
access it.

586
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:43,197
You know I can't
do that.

587
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:46,133
I do. That's why
I kept all these people alive.

588
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:55,142
I'm gonna give you
20 minutes,

589
00:25:55,144 --> 00:25:56,644
and then...

590
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:01,348
I'm gonna ask
you again.

591
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,452
Damn it!

592
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:06,654
They must have
jammers in here.

593
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:09,023
No cell or Wi-Fi service.

594
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,257
Uh, would you like
to share

595
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:11,959
with the rest
of the class?

596
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:16,063
These monitors work
just like TVs,

597
00:26:16,065 --> 00:26:19,333
receiving broadcast
signals on the 700 megahertz band.

598
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:20,801
Um...

599
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:22,202
I have a friend who's
into this kind of stuff.

600
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:23,871
Occasionally,
I listen to her.

601
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,240
If I can just switch
the chipset

602
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:29,710
into transmitting mode,

603
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:31,779
I should be able
to contact my team.

604
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:34,381
Oh, man. Lyla does not have time to
wait on your team.

605
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:35,816
We've got to
do something.

606
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:37,217
Yeah? Well, you're not
doing anything, Andy.

607
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:38,652
Look, man. Your wife
is in there!

608
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:41,221
Now's not the time
to not trust me.

609
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:43,390
Come on, come on,
come on.

610
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,732
Son of a bitch.

611
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:56,704
- Hey.
- You were just putting on

612
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:57,738
a little show
for me, huh?

613
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,872
Get your hands
off me, man.

614
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,040
What's wrong with you?

615
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:01,508
I see you buddying
up with Joyner,

616
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,743
talking to him,
thick as thieves.

617
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:04,011
Would you relax?

618
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,879
We were talking
about Blackjack.

619
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:08,148
I was telling him about the card counting
technique you taught me.

620
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,217
- Really, Andy?
- Yeah, really.

621
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:14,822
Ok, man.

622
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:16,623
Because I can't have
you backsliding, all right?

623
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,493
Man, I agreed to go
through this whole army thing,

624
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:22,229
and I kept my end
of the bargain.

625
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,031
Now I need you
to keep yours,

626
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,333
and I need you
to start treating me like a brother

627
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:29,536
and not like
a criminal.

628
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:31,972
Ok.

629
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:33,874
I'm sorry.

630
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:35,242
You're right.

631
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:39,847
John, Shadowspire never made
a move on the shipment,

632
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:41,715
so whatever their
next move is, it--

633
00:27:41,717 --> 00:27:43,884
it's not railguns.

634
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:47,654
Just call me when you get
something new from your brother.

635
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:49,056
All right.

636
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:52,259
Ahh.

637
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:55,562
I am so glad our new lair has
elevator access.

638
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:57,064
Hi.

639
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:59,900
Curtis has anointed
himself my personal chauffeur.

640
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:02,036
Fancy. It's a good
thing he didn't ask

641
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:03,804
too many questions
about coming to your campaign office

642
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:05,706
in the middle
of the night.

643
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,775
What are you
doing here?

644
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:11,645
Well, I was at home,

645
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:13,781
feeling more
self-pity

646
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:17,951
than I have in my entire life
when it hit me.

647
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:20,087
This is who I am.

648
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:21,822
I wanted to come
along on your

649
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,991
awesome superhero
adventure

650
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,061
because I wanted to
help people,

651
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:30,964
and the old me
was so angry at the world,

652
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:34,501
but that anger
never accomplished anything.

653
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:38,806
It just created
more anger

654
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:43,077
and some seriously
bad personal style choices.

655
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,713
I wanted to do
some good in the world.

656
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:49,483
Hmm.

657
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:50,584
Ow.

658
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:52,119
That was
a good speech.

659
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,954
I thought you'd be
a little more impressed.

660
00:28:53,956 --> 00:28:56,290
It was a good speech,
but--

661
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:58,659
- but--how did it go again?
- Felicity.

662
00:28:58,661 --> 00:29:02,096
"If I know you"--
and I do--

663
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:06,133
you're probably thinking
what happened was your fault."

664
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:10,037
I'm here to tell
you that it's not

665
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,639
and that it's
not mine either.

666
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:13,974
It's the fault
of only one man,

667
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:15,175
and he has
an extremely

668
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:17,377
on-the-nose
and alliterative name.

669
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:18,512
Heh.

670
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:21,014
And we're going to
stop him,

671
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:25,519
not out of guilt
or vengeance, or regret.

672
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,655
We are going to
stop him because it's what we do.

673
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:33,894
That's who we are.

674
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:38,665
- That was a good speech.
- Yeah.

675
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,568
I'm very happy
to hear it.

676
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:50,177
Uh, we're gonna need
to get some ramps.

677
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:56,316
Argus has been
compromised,

678
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:59,586
and Lyla's being
held hostage.

679
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:02,723
I found this
in your office.

680
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:04,291
Hope you don't mind.

681
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:08,729
Lieutenant, we picked up an
unauthorized comm

682
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:10,664
out of the detention
area.

683
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,699
Take someone
and look into it.

684
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,641
Go on.

685
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:24,011
You might not get
the chance to enjoy it again.

686
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:26,847
It's been
20 minutes.

687
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:28,415
Am I gonna have to
downsize your

688
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:30,417
organization
yet again?

689
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,785
Apparently.

690
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:34,087
Well, that's rather
cold-blooded.

691
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:37,457
You really don't know her that well
at all, do you?

692
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:40,294
Ms. Michaels is one
of my most trusted agents.

693
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,728
She knows better
than anyone

694
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,463
that I'm perfectly
capable of watching you

695
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:46,600
execute every person
in this room,

696
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:50,238
and I'll still never give you
the Rubicon access codes.

697
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:55,542
Hmm.

698
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:59,179
Is that right,
Ms. Michaels?

699
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,981
It's right.

700
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:02,382
It's why I left.

701
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:04,484
Amanda Waller doesn't make
decisions based

702
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,955
on the value
of human life.

703
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:10,257
Pity.

704
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,658
No!

705
00:31:15,464 --> 00:31:20,334
Well, Ms. Michaels,
most trusted agent,

706
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,669
looks like you now
have 20 minutes.

707
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,277
John.

708
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,846
Oh, my God. No. No!

709
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:34,514
John, John, John.

710
00:31:34,516 --> 00:31:37,851
John, please!
He's gonna kill her.

711
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:40,087
You can't afford not
to trust me.

712
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:52,683
Overwatch, we're on site.

713
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:53,917
Excuse me?

714
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,118
Well, I thought that
it was time

715
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,286
you got a code name.

716
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:57,788
- What do you think?
- It's perfect.

717
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,756
Was gonna go with Oracle,
but it's taken.

718
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:01,425
Shadowspire's
got the entire area

719
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:02,759
around C&C in lockdown.

720
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:04,761
You guys are the only
game in town.

721
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:05,962
Can you get us
inside?

722
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,334
Like that you mean?

723
00:32:17,142 --> 00:32:19,176
Well, it's about time
you guys came looking.

724
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:20,744
Who the hell are
you supposed to be?

725
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:23,513
Sergeant Andrew Diggle,
52nd regiment, 5th battalion.

726
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:24,781
What are you doing
locked up here?

727
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:26,249
It's a long story,

728
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:28,118
shorter version being
my brother's a jerk.

729
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,787
Lucky for me, though,
your CO and I go way back.

730
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,422
If you're serious
about Lyla Michaels

731
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:33,958
giving up
the Rubicon codes,

732
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,259
you will get on the radio
and tell Lieutenant Joyner

733
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:38,361
the guy that taught him
how to count cards is here

734
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:41,164
and, uh, wants to
help him out.

735
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:53,176
Andy Diggle? You look
pretty good for a dead man.

736
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:56,012
Here I thought
I put on weight.

737
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,481
What are you doing
at Argus,

738
00:32:57,483 --> 00:32:58,949
much less alive?

739
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:00,517
Amanda Waller
brought me in

740
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,185
because of my former association
with you guys,

741
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:05,722
but, uh, small
world, though.

742
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,891
Your friend
Ms. Michaels--

743
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,192
she's my
sister-in-law.

744
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:10,327
- Andy.
- Point being,

745
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:12,229
her husband is
crawling around

746
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,364
these ventilation
shafts right now.

747
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:16,500
If you put a gun
on him,

748
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:18,335
she'll tell you whatever you
need to know.

749
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:19,436
You son of a--

750
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:21,972
Hey.

751
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:23,240
Turning on your
own brother.

752
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:24,641
That's ice-cold.

753
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,009
Well, you know
better than most.

754
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:30,313
John and I never
saw eye to eye.

755
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:33,517
Gentlemen, check
the facility's ventilation shafts.

756
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:38,388
Overwatch?

757
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,856
C&C, 3 floors down,
northeast corner.

758
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:42,125
Well, give us
a few minutes.

759
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:08,618
The other Diggle brother.

760
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,053
Isn't this quaint?

761
00:34:10,055 --> 00:34:11,254
I get out of these cuffs,
and you'll see how quaint

762
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,056
you think I can be.

763
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:14,958
It's a shame you can't be
more like the little Diggle.

764
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,794
His pragmatism has proven
to be quite the asset.

765
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:20,630
Now if your brother's right,
you should be able

766
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:24,000
to convince your wife
to give me

767
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:25,602
what I want.

768
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,805
Johnnie, if Rubicon
ever got out in the open--

769
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:30,140
Ms. Michaels,
in 5 seconds,

770
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:32,976
it's your husband's brains
that will be out in the open.

771
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,845
4...

772
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:36,780
3...

773
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,481
2...

774
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:39,649
Do it.

775
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:43,153
Do it, Lyla.

776
00:34:43,155 --> 00:34:44,621
It's all right.

777
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:52,429
Excellent.

778
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:53,897
Unh!

779
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:55,131
If you've run out
of guys to punch,

780
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,299
Spartan needs an assist,

781
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,801
two assists actually.

782
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,236
Tell us what to do.

783
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:00,904
Shadowspire's getting
the access codes

784
00:35:00,906 --> 00:35:02,339
for a secure vault
in the sublevel.

785
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:03,940
I'm trying to stop
the codes from working,

786
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:05,675
but I'm going to need
Canary and Speedy

787
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:07,244
as my insurance policies.

788
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:11,314
Where do you want me?

789
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:19,456
This is taking
too long.

790
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,757
Something's wrong.

791
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:23,126
Someone's locking me
out of the system.

792
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:29,633
Go away.

793
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:30,934
I'm not you anymore.

794
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:34,337
I haven't been
for a long time.

795
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,709
I can't get in.

796
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:41,144
I have all
the right codes,

797
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:42,679
but someone on the outside
is preventing me

798
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,648
from entering
the sublevel vault.

799
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,850
That's extremely
unfortunate.

800
00:36:43,408 --> 00:36:46,142
- You ok?
- Yeah.

801
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:47,544
You ok?

802
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:48,745
Yeah, we're fine.

803
00:36:51,616 --> 00:36:52,983
Good job.

804
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:54,384
It was like you said.

805
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,786
It was the only way
to get us both in here.

806
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:58,355
Just remember whose
idea this was.

807
00:36:58,357 --> 00:36:59,389
Eh, what were you
expecting,

808
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,057
a kiss
from the president?

809
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,916
To Amanda Waller?

810
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,220
To Amanda Waller.

811
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:15,956
You remember
that time that she tried

812
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:20,293
to take down the city
with a drone strike?

813
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:22,062
Good times.

814
00:37:22,064 --> 00:37:23,930
Hey. Thanks for
the assist tonight.

815
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:26,266
I'm just glad to be useful.

816
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:28,234
Good job jury-rigging
the security system, though.

817
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:30,236
Just trying to make
you proud, Felicity.

818
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:32,605
You did.

819
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:35,442
What are you
gonna do about Andy?

820
00:37:35,444 --> 00:37:37,243
Still haven't made
a decision on that.

821
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:40,513
You mean, even though
he just saved you life?

822
00:37:40,515 --> 00:37:43,750
Yeah, well, you guys
had a whole lot to do with that,

823
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:44,884
but you're right.

824
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:46,086
This is the first
time in 8 years

825
00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:47,620
I've seen shades
of my old brother.

826
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,465
You wanted to see
me, sir?

827
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:06,873
Already got my cut.

828
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,743
Eh, it's a token of appreciation
from the boss.

829
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,379
Traded the opium
for something else.

830
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:13,980
Like what?

831
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:16,816
Ask him yourself.

832
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:19,419
Thank you for your
assistance, Mr. Diggle.

833
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:21,521
Lieutenant Joyner sings
your praises.

834
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:22,689
Happy to help.

835
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,124
What did you get
for the opium?

836
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:26,993
Legend speaks of a place
of immeasurable power.

837
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:29,329
Many have disappeared
searching for it,

838
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:31,798
so much so that the locals
simply refer to it

839
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,300
by one word--

840
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:35,802
Purgatory.

841
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:43,376
I thought we were
totally unpacked.

842
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:44,978
Just humor me.

843
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,313
Ahem. What am I
getting?

844
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,816
Ah, yes.
The white box.

845
00:38:49,818 --> 00:38:52,118
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

846
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:59,225
Ahh. You ready?

847
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,294
Wow!

848
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:02,862
When you said that
you made some

849
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,831
bad personal style
choices,

850
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,166
you weren't kidding.

851
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:08,735
This is the old me,

852
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,503
a rebellious
brunette hacker

853
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:12,906
who didn't listen to anyone
else's rules but her own.

854
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:14,707
You're not that
person anymore?

855
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,309
Nope.

856
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:19,412
What you did
last night was amazing.

857
00:39:19,414 --> 00:39:22,215
- I was really badass.
- Yeah.

858
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:23,716
Though the old me
probably would have stolen

859
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,252
the plans for Rubicon
and released them

860
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:26,753
as some sort
of political statement.

861
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:29,022
The old me would have
snapped Joyner's neck.

862
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,390
Yeah.

863
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,525
We've both grown.

864
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:34,828
Thank you for always
being on my side.

865
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,930
No place I'd
rather be.

866
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:42,936
Hand me that garbage can
and this lighter.

867
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,441
Ahem. How much
medication are you on?

868
00:39:48,443 --> 00:39:49,776
Absolutely none.

869
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,177
Ok.

870
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:56,850
Just want to make sure
that my past stays the past, you know?

871
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:03,690
Wha-pa!

872
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,759
One more thing
from me.

873
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:11,364
The doctor said your
condition is permanent,

874
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:14,267
and I don't think
that it's healthy

875
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:17,237
or productive
for either of us

876
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:22,208
to live in denial,

877
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,829
but...

878
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,701
I have seen people
speed and shrink and fly.

879
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,120
We watched a friend
of ours come back from the dead.

880
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:38,424
That is the world
we live in now...

881
00:40:41,263 --> 00:40:44,831
And I will not stop
searching it

882
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,800
until we find a way
to make you walk again.

883
00:40:52,974 --> 00:40:54,440
Hey.

884
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:56,276
Are you sure about this?
Because I'm not.

885
00:40:56,278 --> 00:40:58,244
Better than being
in that cage, right?

886
00:40:58,246 --> 00:41:00,413
You might want to wait outside.
I have it from here.

887
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,884
Make yourself
comfortable.

888
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:07,220
Lyla's cooking something.

889
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:08,955
Hey.

890
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:10,356
If this is about
reconnecting

891
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:14,494
with Carly and Andy,
as well, I, um...

892
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,828
I get it, Andy.

893
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:18,698
Step by step, right?

894
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,966
Andy.

895
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:21,634
Hey.

896
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:23,136
I'm making pork roast.

897
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:24,470
Johnnie said it's
your favorite.

898
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:26,072
Yeah, yeah, it is.

899
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:27,473
I got another
surprise for you, man.

900
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:29,642
Just a second.

901
00:41:29,644 --> 00:41:30,710
Hey, Lyla. I, uh--

902
00:41:30,712 --> 00:41:32,845
not a word.

903
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:34,180
John and I both
agreed to this.

904
00:41:34,182 --> 00:41:36,282
She's excited
to meet you.

905
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:41,321
This is
your niece...

906
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:43,156
- Hey.
- Sara...

907
00:41:43,158 --> 00:41:44,991
And that's your
uncle Andy.

908
00:41:44,993 --> 00:41:46,159
Andy.

909
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:48,428
Yeah.

910
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,731
She's got mom's eyes.

911
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,099
Welcome home, man.

912
00:41:53,123 --> 00:41:59,623
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

913
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:21,521
Greg!
Move your head.
