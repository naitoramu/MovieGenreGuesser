1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,766
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,844
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,925
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,003
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,446
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,605
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,602
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,120
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,601
The defendant is found not guilty.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,602
- Hello, Moira.
- What do you want, Malcolm?

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,802
Thea is my daughter.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,326
What do these guys want
with a 70-year-old sub?

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,363
What's on it, it'll save the human race.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,130
Will it save him?

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,487
Sir, there's been a development.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,848
Brother Cyrus, how do you feel?

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,561
Stronger.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,284
What was that?

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,369
Mrs. Queen, welcome back to the company.

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,160
Thank you.

21
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:11,985
You look fabulous. Really.
Better than ever.

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,521
- Did you do something to your hair?
- Yes, I shampooed it...

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,409
without eight women
and a guard watching.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,073
Ha, ha. Is it okay to laugh?
Because I was ordered

25
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,511
not to say anything about
you being in prison...

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,849
- just to avoid any awkward exchanges.
- Like that one.

27
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,245
Right.

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,449
We need to drill down on
these numbers before the earnings call.

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,006
Oliver. I didn't realize your mother
was stopping by for a visit today.

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,243
Well, it's not a visit.
This is her company too.

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,810
Of course.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,007
- How are you, Moira?
- Back, Isabel.

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,448
Mr. Queen, may I speak to you for a minute?

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,760
What sort of message does it send to the
investment community, to this city...

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,764
if we hand Queen Consolidated
right back to your mother?

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,366
- She was acquitted.
- By a jury, not by the city.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,930
Oliver, stop thinking like a son...

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,248
and start thinking like a CEO.

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,165
Oliver.

40
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,881
There's been a break-in.

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,964
Damn.

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,607
This door was made
of expanded reinforced titanium.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,121
- What did they use to do this?
- We're not sure yet.

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,847
No sign of any explosives.
Maybe a crane, maybe a forklift.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,970
We're guessing there was at least
three of them, maybe four.

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,811
Given how quick they got
in and out of here.

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,130
They were fast.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,164
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, stop.
Wait. You don't even have a fare!

49
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,687
Any idea what these guys
were so hot to break in here for?

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,561
Didn't happen to leave a spare
earthquake machine lying around, did you?

51
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,685
Sorry.

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,921
This is what we were able
to pull off the, uh, security cameras.

53
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,686
This is the only guy we got on video. The
rest of the crew must have come in after.

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,444
Actually, it was only one guy.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,206
Sorry I'm late.

56
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,805
Actually, my train was late.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,367
The second one. The first
one, I did miss...

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,889
but that was my cab driver's fault.
I've got this great traffic app and...

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,327
He thought that he was right.

60
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,165
- I'm here now though, so...
- Great. Who the hell are you?

61
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,690
And do your parents
know that you're here?

62
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:48,871
I'm Barry Allen.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,082
From the Central City Police Department.

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,925
I'm with the Crime Scene
Investigation Unit.

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,447
We're working on a case
with some similar...

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,207
unexplained elements in Central City,
so when the report of your robbery...

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,529
came over the wire,
my captain sent me up here.

68
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,007
And you think one guy ripped through
this door like it was tinfoil?

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,726
One very strong guy, yeah.

70
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,731
Uh, it takes about 120050-foot pounds
of torque to break someone's neck.

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,649
See the marks on the guard's neck?

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,691
The bruising pattern suggests
the killer used only one hand.

73
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,411
I'm guessing you don't know
how hard it is to break someone's neck.

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,688
Hmm? No. No idea.

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,969
Uh, we're gonna need a list
of the entire inventory here...

76
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,646
to figure out exactly what was stolen.

77
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,848
Actually, I think I know what was stolen.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,402
A centrifuge. An industrial centrifuge.

79
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,451
Probably the Kord Enterprises 2BX-900,
maybe the six series.

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
Both have a three-column base.

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,601
Here, you can see
the three sets of broken bolts...

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,287
where the thief
just, poof, ripped it out of the ground.

83
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,046
And what exactly is a centrifuge?

84
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,250
It separates liquids. The centripetal
acceleration causes denser substances...

85
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,432
to separate out along
the radial direction.

86
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:05,349
The lighter objects
move to the top.

87
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,804
- What did you say your name was again?
- Barry Allen.

88
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,530
Felicity Smoak.

89
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,971
You can see the cracks
heading towards the door.

90
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,602
Footsteps. One guy.

91
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,642
Anyway, it's just a theory.

92
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,203
- One backed by a lot of evidence.
- There has to be another explanation.

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,488
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

94
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,131
You might want to fill
our mutual friend in on this.

95
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,291
Don't worry.

96
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,761
I'm sure he's already on it.

97
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,449
We need to change directions.

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,046
- Ten degrees north.
- We need to rest.

99
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,727
If Ivo and any of his men survived
that blast, they'll be tracking us.

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,609
We keep moving.

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,209
Five minutes.

102
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,091
- Will you watch him, please?
- Of course.

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,167
Do you believe him?
That this Hozen will lead us...

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,846
- to a wrecked Japanese sub?
- Ivo seems to think so.

105
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,204
I just hope whatever miracle serum
they're after is actually on board.

106
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,211
For his sake.

107
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,328
How do you know that girl?

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,891
Sara was on my father's boat...

109
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,281
with me.

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,362
What about the girl in the picture? Laurel?

111
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,406
The girl you told me you were in love with?

112
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,963
Sara is her sister.

113
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,042
I feel like taking a walk.

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,641
Anyone care to join me?

115
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,567
I guess a lot's happened in the last year.

116
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,449
Oliver. Got the final inventory
from Applied Sciences.

117
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,041
That CSI from Central City was right.

118
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,931
- Only thing missing is a centrifuge.
- You have to see this.

119
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,005
I pulled up CC traffic camera footage
from across the street of Applied Sciences.

120
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,646
This is three minutes
after the alarm went off.

121
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,646
Can we help you with something, detective?

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,280
Oh, CSIs aren't actually detectives.

123
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,445
We don't even carry guns,
just some plastic baggies. Ha, ha.

124
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,250
Where should I set up my equipment?

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,448
- I'll show you.
- What's going on?

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,082
Your assistant said that you preferred
to keep the investigation in-house.

127
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,447
I cleared it with my captain
to give you a hand.

128
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,121
- Ahem. What are you doing?
- We need to find this intruder...

129
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,806
and he seems to know more about it
than any of us.

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,646
Look, forensic science
isn't exactly my forte, so...

131
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,961
I'd say we need him...

132
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,804
wouldn't you?

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,130
Mm-hm.

134
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,600
I'll show you around.

135
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,484
Why am I getting the feeling you know more
about this than Felicity's new friend?

136
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,682
Pray I'm wrong.

137
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,048
Hi. I'm sorry about what happened
at the office this morning.

138
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,170
There are a lot of people who think
I got away with murder, Oliver.

139
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,560
Maybe I did.

140
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,248
Mom, the trial, the Undertaking, Malcolm
Merlyn, all of that is behind us now.

141
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,080
- And we need everyone to see that.
- How are we going to do that?

142
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,969
We throw a party.

143
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,691
Thea.

144
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,002
Roy.

145
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:00,313
Did I hear you guys say
something about a party?

146
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,631
A "welcome back to Queen
Consolidated" party for Mom.

147
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:03,656
I don't think so.

148
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,682
If things are gonna get back to normal...

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,763
then we need to start acting normal.

150
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,123
Normal for us is a lavish party.

151
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,921
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen, I
can't stay for brunch.

152
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,407
I guess we gotta go.

153
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,290
Bye.

154
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,529
I'll take care of everything.

155
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,247
- What exactly are you looking for?
- Your thief's shoes touched the ground...

156
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,883
which means he tracked in dozens of clues
as to where he's been the past few days.

157
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,529
Gotcha.

158
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,524
Shouldn't take long.

159
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,411
So you've seen him, right?

160
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,686
The vigilante?

161
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,364
I read that he saved you.

162
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,085
What was he like?

163
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,611
- Green.
- Green.

164
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,762
That's interesting, right?

165
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,763
I mean, why green?

166
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,446
Black would be better
for stealth and urban camouflage.

167
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,284
Me, personally...

168
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,002
I think that he trained in some sort of,
like, forest or jungle environment...

169
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,202
and the green is a nod to that.

170
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,442
I don't give the vigilante much thought.

171
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,521
Police reports show
that he uses carbon arrows.

172
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,126
But if he switched
to an aluminum-carbon composite...

173
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,886
he would have far better penetration.

174
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,963
Maybe he thinks he penetrates just fine.

175
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,202
Do you wanna know something else?

176
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,805
I think that he has partners.

177
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,930
Definitely someone with a background
in computer sciences.

178
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,924
Yeah.

179
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,644
Why are you so interested in the vigilante?

180
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,922
When I was 11, my mom was murdered.

181
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,330
I'm so sorry.

182
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,321
They never caught the guy who did it.

183
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,689
Maybe he would've.

184
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,689
The soil, there's a
crystalline structure in it.

185
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,369
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

186
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,082
It's sugar.

187
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,211
Sin, you said this was an emergency.

188
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,687
No offense,
but, Thea, you shouldn't be here.

189
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,810
In the alleyway of the club I own?

190
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,921
It's my friend Max. He's missing.
I haven't seen him for a week. No one has.

191
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,685
Something happened to him.

192
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,761
I figured you knew someone who could help.

193
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,364
Roy can help you.

194
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,127
I thought you wanted me
to stay out of trouble.

195
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,648
I kind of like that you never turn away
from someone who needs help.

196
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,650
- I'll just get someone to cover the club.
- What do you mean?

197
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,286
Oh, I'm coming with you.

198
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,804
I hear you're throwing a party.

199
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,408
- I didn't get my invite.
- Where exactly should I have addressed it?

200
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,884
Starling City Cemetery?

201
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:26,754
I know that's where you
wish I was right now.

202
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,365
Lying beside my son.

203
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,364
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you,
Malcolm?

204
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,328
You killed Tommy.

205
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,649
You killed your son.

206
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,561
- You cannot have my daughter.
- Our daughter.

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,688
I think we both needed someone that night.

208
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,247
I felt so bad
about betraying Rebecca's memory...

209
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,967
that I left Starling.

210
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,567
Left Tommy behind.

211
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,842
That's when I made my way
to Nanda Parbat...

212
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,321
where I found my new purpose.

213
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,284
In a way, Moira...

214
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,801
you made me the man I am today.

215
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,201
Thea is innocent.

216
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,725
She loved Robert.

217
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,724
Please don't take that away from her,
I'm begging you.

218
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,848
Thea is all I have left.

219
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,482
Tell her the truth...

220
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,802
and tell her soon.

221
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,488
- You found something?
- We found something.

222
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,521
There were trace amounts
of sucrose in a speck

223
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:30,425
of dirt the killer dragged
in here on his boot.

224
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,723
Which got me thinking. There's a
sugar refinery two miles from here.

225
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,021
The land around it is
suffused in waste sugar, so I

226
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,432
checked. They had a delivery
truck stolen a few days ago.

227
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,244
Their truck matches the
make and model of the

228
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:42,029
truck the thief used to
steal the centrifuge.

229
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,960
- Can you track the vehicle?
- We've been trying.

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,650
What was that?

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,927
You're not going to believe this. The truck,
it was just used to rob a blood bank.

232
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,002
Are you sure?

233
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,671
Yeah, our guy just made off
with 30,000 cc's of O Negative.

234
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,593
He has super-strength,
likes blood.

235
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:01,307
Please don't tell me we
suddenly believe in vampires.

236
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,761
We should get this information
to the local police.

237
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,041
I'll take care of that.

238
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,568
Did you say that you were working
a similar case in Central City?

239
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,570
Yeah. Um... Yeah, you know, it's similar.

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,330
Has similar elements. A
lot of similarities.

241
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,925
Right.

242
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,007
I want you to look into this Allen kid.
There's more to him than he's letting on.

243
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,322
His intentions seem pretty clear to me.

244
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,126
Just do it, please.

245
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,847
Oliver, when are you gonna tell me
what exactly we're up against?

246
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,805
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

247
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,930
Thank you.

248
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,321
You were right to ask if I knew more
than I was letting on.

249
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,684
I've seen men with
abilities like that before.

250
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:08,709
You have?

251
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,890
Where?

252
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,008
The island.

253
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,441
The second year marooned there, we...

254
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,364
I came across the remains of a Japanese
World War ll military project.

255
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,281
It was a serum designed
to create human weapons.

256
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,801
Human weapons?
My God, what's next, aliens?

257
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,122
This is real, Diggle.

258
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,041
Those five years that I was away,
I came across things that just...

259
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,368
defy explanation.

260
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,642
There's a doctor, his name is Ivo...

261
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,806
and he came to the island
to test the serum on people.

262
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,650
The ones that survived...

263
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,805
their endurance, reflexes and strength
were all enhanced.

264
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,646
- You think this Ivo's in Starling City?
- He's dead.

265
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,327
So is everyone that he injected
with the serum...

266
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,006
the last of which I burned.

267
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,360
- You think someone found the recipe?
- A centrifuge and a large supply of blood.

268
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,046
I think someone wants to make more of it.

269
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,646
- A lot more.
- Why couldn't you have been marooned...

270
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,882
- on Aruba?
- There's a third component.

271
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,168
A strong sedative.

272
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,363
I preferred it when you
left these in people.

273
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,365
I need you to analyze the
blood on the arrowhead.

274
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,430
If we can figure out which
sedative they're using...

275
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,211
We can figure out
where the next robbery will be.

276
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,368
Barry and I will get right on it.

277
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,209
I think our Miss Smoak is smitten.

278
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,204
Diggle, what did you find out
about Mr. Allen?

279
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,522
He's not who he says he is.

280
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,111
How are you holding up?

281
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:52,511
I could do with a
better-looking crutch. Heh.

282
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,323
You two seem like you've gotten
pretty chummy.

283
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,881
We're here.

284
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,124
There must be a fissure in the island
below the waterline...

285
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,601
for it to come that far inland.

286
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,481
Unbelievable.

287
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,287
They have nitric acid next to hydrazine?

288
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,690
Permanganates on top of acetone?
This is the definition of dangerous.

289
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,083
If it's so dangerous,
maybe you shouldn't be touching them.

290
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,610
- Barry?
- Yeah.

291
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,923
I managed to get a sample of the perpetrator's
blood from the police department.

292
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,607
We need to isolate a sedative in the blood.
It could lead us to the thief.

293
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,025
How did the police get it?

294
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,675
Apparently the vigilante
shot him with an arrow.

295
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,488
You're kidding.

296
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,449
You know what this means, right?

297
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,251
This means the vigilante's
working the same case we are.

298
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,601
Go figure.

299
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,451
- How did you get it?
- Oliver has a lot of connections.

300
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,170
Heh. Wow.

301
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,529
Pays to work for a billionaire.

302
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,962
Actually, my take-home's nothing special.

303
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,567
Especially given I am rarely at home
since I'm with him every night.

304
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,964
- I didn't realize you and he were...
- Oh, no.

305
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,441
We're... He and I are not...

306
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,922
No, I do not like Oliver.

307
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,049
Um, I was invited to a work function.

308
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,160
It's a... It's a party.

309
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,446
And I have a plus one.

310
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,449
I was thinking you would make
a really good plus one.

311
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,163
There's not gonna be dancing, is there?

312
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,802
I'm just not too good on my feet.

313
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,170
Ugh. Reeks in here.

314
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,120
Guess your friend
wasn't too into painting seascapes.

315
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,160
Max is like any starving artist.

316
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,802
Starving.

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,528
But I could always crash here
when I didn't have a place to stay.

318
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,648
Hey, this blood drive was a week ago.

319
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,444
When did you say he went missing?

320
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,690
That day.

321
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,920
It's Daily.

322
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,963
Someone's looking for Maxwell Stanton.

323
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,165
Then they should find him.

324
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,044
Yes, Brother Blood.

325
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,451
Blood provides life.

326
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,407
Blood provides power.

327
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,449
And with power...

328
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,045
there's no limit to what I can do.

329
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,400
Central City is just a day away
from making history...

330
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,043
when the controversial S.T.A.R. Labs
particle accelerator is finally turned on.

331
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,972
Pretty cool, right?

332
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:15,148
You know there's been a
100-percent increase...

333
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,284
in earthquakes since they turned on
the Large Hadron Collider?

334
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,131
That data is misleading.

335
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,409
- You know about misleading, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

336
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,451
He's not a full CSI. He's an assistant,
whose bosses don't know you're in Starling.

337
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,605
And there is no similar case in
Central City. So tell me, Barry...

338
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,726
what are you really doing here?

339
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,451
- I told you my mom was murdered.
- By your father.

340
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,246
He didn't do it.

341
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,449
You said that the police
didn't find the man who killed her.

342
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,411
The police think they did.

343
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,050
My dad has been serving a life sentence.

344
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,404
- They didn't believe me.
- About what?

345
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,649
I was 11.

346
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,649
One night...

347
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,609
something just came into our house,
like a tornado.

348
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,083
A blur.

349
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,965
Somewhere inside the blur, I saw a person.

350
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,444
My dad went to fight it.

351
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,370
I tried to get him when suddenly...

352
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,731
I was 20 blocks away from our house.

353
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,201
Nobody believed me.

354
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,530
Heh. They thought
I was trying to cover for my father.

355
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,521
But what I saw that night was real.

356
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,924
As real as the man that ripped down
that metal door with his bare hands.

357
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,247
That's why I look into cases like this.

358
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,208
The ones nobody believes are possible.

359
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,649
Maybe if I can just make sense of one...

360
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,046
I might be able to find out
who really killed my mother.

361
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,207
And free my dad.

362
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,529
I am sorry I lied to you.

363
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,240
Better find another plus one.

364
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,404
He did lie about who he really was.

365
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,766
And what do we do every day?

366
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,524
- Hey. How's everything going in there?
- Good evening, Queens.

367
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,331
- May I have a word?
- Yeah.

368
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,445
- I'm sorry if I overreacted earlier.
- You think?

369
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,887
Right now you need to apologize
to your mother.

370
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,650
- Not me.
- For what?

371
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,961
For being wrong.

372
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,049
I guess these days I only draw a crowd
when I'm on trial for murder.

373
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,522
- Mom, you don't have to...
- We have guests.

374
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,684
However few of them there are.

375
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,486
This is not your fault, Ollie.

376
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,245
- How's your mom doing?
- Oh, you know us Queen women...

377
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,085
- nothing gets to us.
- You must take after your dad.

378
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,330
Sorry.

379
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,641
Sin, what's up?

380
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,922
- I found Max.
- Where?

381
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,969
- I'm on my way.
- They find Max?

382
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,249
Um, no. She just wants me to stop by.

383
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,683
- I can come with you.
- You should stay here.

384
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,889
Your mom needs you. Okay,
I'll call you later.

385
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,087
Time for a dance?

386
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,687
Not really feeling
like dancing with you, Oliver.

387
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,730
I know. And that is why...

388
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,882
I called him.

389
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,370
FYI, they will card him at the bar.

390
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,810
Hi.

391
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,649
I was serious
about not being able to dance...

392
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,009
but I'll hold your hands and sway. Heh.

393
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,206
- Sold.
- Okay.

394
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,244
Sorry.

395
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,245
I tried to warn you.

396
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,489
I tried to ignore you.

397
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,410
I am sorry, Oliver.

398
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,810
Yeah.

399
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,729
Oliver threw you a lovely party.

400
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,044
Oliver's a good son,
if not the best judge of character.

401
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,045
Is everything okay?

402
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,611
Everything is going perfectly.

403
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,287
He doesn't have long.

404
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,284
If this miracle drug is on board,
then we need to find it now.

405
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,721
Slade, we'll be back in
a few minutes, okay?

406
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,283
I'll just get comfortable.

407
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,449
There.

408
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,723
Miracle.

409
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,684
I wasn't ever sure it was real.

410
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,415
What happens if we
give it to Slade?

411
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,675
He needs a sedative in
his bloodstream first.

412
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,282
They might have potassium bromide
or Barbital.

413
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,046
Ugh. It's empty.

414
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,170
What happens if we give it to him
without the sedative?

415
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,000
- Sara!
- He'll die for sure.

416
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,525
He's going to die anyway.

417
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,680
What was that?

418
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,041
Ivo and his men.

419
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,567
They're on the sub.

420
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,687
- Have you made contact?
- Yes.

421
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,368
He said to tell you that your information
was gratefully accepted.

422
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,083
Thank you.

423
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,691
- Who was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

424
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,889
Thank you for tonight, Oliver.
It was a lovely party.

425
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,242
I'm so sorry that I put you through that.

426
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,530
Oh. Listen, I don't care what anyone else
in the city thinks of me.

427
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,330
I only care what you two think.

428
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,801
And I have to get back to the office.

429
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,281
- Mm-hm.
- Excuse me.

430
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,241
Thea.

431
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,601
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Sure, what is it?

432
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,681
I love you.

433
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,205
I love you too.

434
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,088
Yes. Yes, sir. I...

435
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,724
Yes, Director Singh,
I know that this is not the first time.

436
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,764
Yes, sir, I do value my job. Very much.

437
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,884
I will be on the next train. Mm-hm.

438
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,724
I'll be back tonight. Okay.

439
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,928
Well, my boss found out
I don't have food poisoning.

440
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,843
I need to get back to Central City
if I still wanna be employed.

441
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,047
Which I do.

442
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,969
Um, tell the S.C.P.D. that the sedative
in the thief's blood is ketamine.

443
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,488
It's a schedule-3 controlled substance.
It shouldn't be too hard to track.

444
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,847
- I'll make sure they get it.
- Okay.

445
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,797
It was really nice
working with you.

446
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:41,433
Thank you. Everything.
We couldn't have done it...

447
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,164
without you.

448
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,650
Heh.

449
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,161
Goodbye, Felicity.

450
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,764
Bye.

451
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,322
Max! Get off! Let go.

452
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,491
- Max. Get off of me. Get off.
- Hey, let her go. Let her go.

453
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,966
Stupid cops. They're saying Max OD'd.

454
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,849
- Was he using?
- No.

455
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,650
He made extra cash donating blood.

456
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,963
You really think the hospital would
let him be a donor if he was an addict?

457
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,408
Hey. You can't be here, kid.

458
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,251
We found trace amounts of ketamine
in the thief's blood.

459
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,041
It's a common surgical anesthesia
derived from hydrochloric salt.

460
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,248
Can you use that to track him?

461
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,886
With the current concentration ratio
in the blood sample...

462
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,408
there's only one possible location with
a large enough quantity of the sedative...

463
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,645
that correlates with the amount of blood
the stolen centrifuge can process.

464
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,886
- What is it? There's no sign.
- A.R.G.U.S. doesn't like to advertise.

465
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,065
It's a disaster bunker. Right
on the edge of the Glades.

466
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,551
A.R.G.U.S. has them
all over the country.

467
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,445
They store relief supplies. Food. Clothing.

468
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,524
- Medicine.
- I'm on my way.

469
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,166
Oliver.

470
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,928
I can't believe I'm actually saying this.
The way this arrow head is bent...

471
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,248
it means our thief's muscle density...

472
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,206
is at least 120 pounds per cubic foot.

473
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,051
That's almost the same density
as common concrete.

474
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,726
Your arrows may cut this guy,
but they will not stop him.

475
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,009
I beat someone like this before, Felicity.

476
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,527
- I can do it again.
- What if you can't?

477
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,569
Oliver.

478
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,120
Now, this, it could save you,
or it could kill you.

479
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,487
By the looks on your faces,
I'm gonna die anyway.

480
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,606
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

481
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,931
Not telling you how I really feel.

482
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,923
Do it.

483
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,804
What?

484
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,485
I need your help.

485
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,166
A friend of mine's friend,
the cops think he OD'd.

486
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,800
- But we think he was murdered.
- Why?

487
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,611
Well, he wasn't an addict, for starters.
And this.

488
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,368
This doesn't look like any OD
I've ever seen.

489
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,441
- Stay away from that.
- You know something?

490
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,046
What happened to him?

491
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,840
You're the one who told me to be
your eyes and ears in the streets.

492
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,834
You know what? That is not
good enough for me anymore.

493
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,871
Fine. Then we're
done altogether.

494
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,082
I don't need you.

495
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,766
I have friends that can help me.

496
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,807
- You can't stop us.
- I can slow you down.

497
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,887
And I thought it couldn't hurt
to add extra security guards.

498
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,769
It hurt them.

499
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,969
Badly. Have you prepared Thea?

500
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,369
No.

501
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,370
You will not go near Thea.
You will not speak to her.

502
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,727
And you will never
set foot in this house again.

503
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,089
I set you free, Moira.
Your life belongs to me.

504
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,007
I am through being afraid of you.

505
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,249
Ha, ha. You think you can stop me?

506
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,611
- Even the vigilante couldn't kill me.
- No, he couldn't.

507
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,961
But I know someone who can.

508
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,804
Ra's Al Ghul.

509
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,040
How do you know that name?

510
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,844
Well, I didn't,
until you mentioned Nanda Parbat.

511
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,964
The League of Assassins,
however twisted their aims...

512
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,523
believes very deeply in a code of honor.

513
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,128
Your Undertaking betrayed that code.

514
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,961
- You told Ra's I'm still alive?
- He was so grateful to hear it.

515
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,530
Because he so very much
wants to kill you himself.

516
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,608
So my advice to you, Malcolm:

517
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,001
Run.

518
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,608
This isn't finished.

519
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,125
- Who are you?
- Merely a follower.

520
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,368
- Of who?
- My brother.

521
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,364
Did he give you the Mirakuru?
Did he inject you with it?

522
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,364
No. He saved me with it.

523
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,930
No.

524
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,129
Please.

525
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,284
Please!

526
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,124
Please.

527
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,609
Drop your weapons!

528
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,324
- Oliver.
- Oliver?

529
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,689
- Oliver. Oliver!
- Oliver.

530
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,242
- Is he alive?
- His pulse is weak, but it's there.

531
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,445
Oliver, can you hear me?
His pupils are dilated.

532
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,285
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. It's coded.

533
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,921
Damn it.

534
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,964
Damn it.
I can't break into the dispensary files.

535
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,329
I have no idea what he was injected with.
Poisoned with.

536
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,641
Then we have no choice.

537
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,810
- What are you doing? Dig, wait.
- Calling 911. Can't wait.

538
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,407
How are we supposed to explain this? Everyone's
gonna find out Oliver's the vigilante.

539
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,483
Which won't matter if he's dead.

540
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,365
- Felicity, we can't save him.
- I know. You're right.

541
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,607
We can't.

542
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,922
Hi. Uh, one way to Central City.

543
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,082
It left 10 minutes ago.

544
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,203
Of course it did.

545
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,840
- When is the next one?
- In the morning.

546
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,209
In the morning.

547
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,249
Please save my friend.
