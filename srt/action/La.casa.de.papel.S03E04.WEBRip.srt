1
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:08,791
A NETWORK ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,083
No, no. I am not getting inside there.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,833
Take the bottle.

4
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,333
That's a mousetrap.
We won't get out of there.

5
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,833
That's our entrance.
We'll do it through hard work.

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,541
What the fuck is that smell?

7
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,416
They must have thrown pesticide in there,

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,750
bleach and toxic substances for humans.
I'm not going in.

9
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,000
- It's just water.
- Yes, toxic water.

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,333
Sit down, come on.

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,375
I'll sit down, but I won't go in.

12
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,458
Let's go.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,666
It's easier to train in a swimming pool,
but our job isn't in a fucking pool.

14
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,041
It will be a lot harder than this.

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,583
And way scarier than getting in there.

16
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,416
I'm not afraid.

17
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,916
You're shitting your pants.

18
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,041
And it's because you're a father now.

19
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,125
Look.

20
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,750
I agree with you there, Bogotá.

21
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,083
You were so reckless before,
and you can't do that anymore.

22
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,388
In the past, when shit happened,
I was the only one fucked up by it.

23
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,458
You know that.

24
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,750
Now, I don't want to do certain things.

25
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,625
For example, getting inside a cistern.

26
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,708
I don't want to.

27
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,708
Do you know what it means
to be a good father?

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,458
I don't know anymore.

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,875
Behaving in the exact same way
when you weren't a father.

30
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,708
Of course, and leave the after-party
still high in the morning.

31
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:33,375
If you like to get high on Wednesdays,
you have to keep doing it.

32
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,166
Come on!

33
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,458
You have to,
or you will end up hating your son.

34
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,666
And that would really make you
a bad father. Believe me.

35
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,291
Oh, my God. Do you know
what you can do, Bogotá?

36
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,083
You can write a novel.

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,958
Yes.

38
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,166
How to be a father without getting clean.

39
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,833
You don't have kids, do you?

40
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,541
I have seven.

41
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,916
- Wow.
- The next one will come with a prize.

42
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,916
This is Emilio, the oldest.
He lives in Venezuela. Julián, he's in DF.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,333
He is growing a mustache.
He calls me "dude."

44
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,750
This bastard's a riot. Erik, in Iceland.

45
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,958
Hanna, in Finland. Violinist.

46
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,333
She's a beauty.

47
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,333
Drazen in Montenegro. He's fucking dull.

48
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,166
Yaris, in Thessaloniki, a real character.

49
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,083
Ivanna. Bad-tempered as hell,

50
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,208
but she's an artist. She lives in Odessa.

51
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,250
Seven.

52
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,416
And the next one with a prize.

53
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,916
Sometimes I'm embarrassed for you.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,666
Hey! I take care of all of them.

55
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,500
But I don't stop being me.

56
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,750
Do I go to their school plays

57
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,416
or the games of whatever sport
they play in Iceland?

58
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,250
No, I don't.

59
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,083
But I do randomly show up after six months

60
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,958
and I don't ask them for anything.
Not even a hug or their love.

61
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,333
But they jump on me
and cover me with kisses.

62
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,416
Why?

63
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,083
I don't know why.

64
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,875
Because I'm their fucking father.

65
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,958
Their father.

66
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,125
You can't deny your own DNA.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Never.

68
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,541
If you were a robber, you're still one.

69
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,291
And if you used to risk your life,

70
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,583
keep risking it.

71
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,750
My babies, my babies...

72
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,208
Look what I brought.

73
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,666
A sweet set of earring for myself.

74
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,083
See?

75
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,166
Golden, golden! Sweet gold!

76
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,166
You want them for yourself, don't you?

77
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,208
- Give them to me.
- Here, here.

78
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,833
You've never seen anything like it.

79
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,208
Let's go to work.

80
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,125
We're not done yet.

81
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,458
Open the door for Bogotá.

82
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,333
Come on. The worst is in the past.

83
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,166
Now the fun begins.

84
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,625
You look hot in that neoprene.

85
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,041
What?

86
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,833
Your butt looks smoking hot
in that tight suit.

87
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,791
What's going to be real tight
is the skin from your balls.

88
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,041
Rude fuck.

89
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,375
I am not laughing.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,458
Why do you talk to me like that?

91
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,916
Why?

92
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,083
Here on this job, I am your boss.

93
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,500
Yes, boss. I'm sorry.

94
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,250
Let's not disrespect each other.

95
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,958
Change the bottle!

96
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,625
And you...

97
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,291
Hurry up, come on!

98
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,458
I want those ovens working ASAP.

99
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,708
And the smoke extractors connected.

100
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,416
We're going to melt all the gold
from the fucking national reserve.

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,833
And you! The lance and the bathyscaphe.

102
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:46,916
Absolute priority.

103
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,708
And don't ruffle my feathers again.

104
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,166
Hurry up, gentlemen! Tick-tock! Tick-tock!

105
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,708
Enjoy yourselves!

106
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,125
Let's earn our sandwiches! Come on!

107
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,250
<i>The first time I heard
one could make fire underwater</i>

108
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,916
<i>was in the Monastery of San Giovanni.</i>

109
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,083
<i>I thought it was as improbable
as the fact that I was there,</i>

110
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,916
<i>listening to Gregorian chants.</i>

111
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,958
<i>But when I was told it was possible thanks
to the oxygen bubbles covering the fire,</i>

112
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,083
<i>I thought it was a beautiful way
of blowing up what we went there for:</i>

113
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,541
<i>A safe in which no one could have gotten
into with all those gold bars.</i>

114
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,000
They entered by impersonating the First
Squad of BRIPAC's Sixth Company.

115
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,083
The real one arrived a few minutes later.

116
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,875
Well, fuck me...

117
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,541
They got us good.

118
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,791
They have everyone tapped.

119
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,916
We have to take out everything
that can be bugged.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Anything that can connect to a network
and our phones!

121
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,416
Colonel, let's think about it.
The procedure is to do a sweep.

122
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,860
They can't have everything bugged.

123
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,356
They can hijack whatever they want.
They have a billion euros!

124
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,166
Do you know the budget of UIT?

125
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,041
Sixteen million.
And the whole CNI?

126
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,875
282 million!
282 million against a billion.

127
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,583
They could tap into the intern's phone!

128
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,291
We only have proof that
they've intercepted communications...

129
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,458
These guys even have pictures
of your dick, Ángel!

130
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,958
They even have pictures of that mole
you have on your balls.

131
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,041
<i>Do you want to say hi?
I'm sure they have your mic activated.</i>

132
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,625
Colonel Tamayo,
the usual procedure is to do a sweep.

133
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,541
Everyone, pay attention!

134
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,875
Don't turn on any device that hasn't been

135
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,833
in a box for at least six months.
Not even an Olivetti.

136
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,750
There are no secure networks,
not even the army's or the ministry's.

137
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,875
Total blackout.

138
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,541
And I want all your phones in this bin.

139
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,291
<i>Now!</i>

140
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,000
If you want to call your mommy,
go to a pay phone.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,333
In less than a minute,
we'll be blind and deaf.

142
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,416
<i>Come on, your turn!</i>

143
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,458
He has just fucked us up good.

144
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,250
He's skipping all the protocols.

145
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,625
It's illegal to confiscate phones
without a court order.

146
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,833
Damn!

147
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,750
This changes everything.

148
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,041
<i>Our techs will analyze them
and return them to you</i>

149
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,605
<i>- as soon as possible.</i>
- Let me think.

150
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,041
Antoñanzas, didn't you hear me?

151
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,041
I'm deleting some private things.

152
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,458
It will only be 30 seconds, sir.

153
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,875
For God's sake!
We all know you're seeing Marisol.

154
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,416
Twenty seconds.

155
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,416
Alert level 5.
The CNI's security system is down.

156
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,767
The defense staff's been bugged
and the computers infected

157
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,833
with an unknown virus!

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,416
The last thing UIT is going to do
is read the chat you use to jerk off.

159
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,375
Give me your fucking phone!

160
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,416
For God's sake!

161
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,041
I want a screen with the time that's left
before the bank's security gates open.

162
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,125
Come on!

163
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
You!

164
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,791
Done.

165
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,541
The gauze.

166
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,625
Yes.

167
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,333
We're almost done.

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,375
Done.

169
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,458
<i>Palermo.</i>

170
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,250
<i>Palermo, it's urgent.</i>

171
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,750
Professor. It's Tokyo.

172
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
How is Palermo?

173
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,791
Operational, sir.

174
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,583
<i>Listen. They've found out
we have them tapped.</i>

175
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,586
We have to accelerate everything
and remain calm.

176
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,875
Calm?

177
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,208
You can be calm because you're in the van.

178
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,250
We're surrounded by Spain's army here.
We don't know when they will enter.

179
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,625
We don't know through which entrance.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,291
Has Bogotástarted?

181
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,625
Yes. He's been down there for a while.

182
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,833
Drilling that door will take longer
than an hour. Maybe more than two.

183
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,333
Professor, how much time is left?

184
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,583
- Fourteen minutes.
- What?

185
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,583
<i>He fucked us and he knows it.</i>

186
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,166
I would try another move.

187
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,416
I even have doubts about Prieto.

188
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,833
But Tamayo is going to skip
all the protocols.

189
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,458
What does that mean?

190
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,541
It means they're going in as soon
as the doors are unlocked.

191
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,291
Good.

192
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,375
Then we have no option
but to use the dolphin. Right?

193
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,250
Exactly. Do you have it?

194
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

195
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,958
Flipper is here with us.

196
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,625
Colonel, radiofrequency waves
are coming in and out of the bank.

197
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,250
Shortwave signals.

198
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,250
I want to hear them.

199
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,541
What the fuck is that?

200
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,041
It sounds like an encrypted radio system.

201
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,583
Once inside, the big question is:

202
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,458
How will we communicate with each other?

203
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,750
Palermo.

204
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,791
Boom!

205
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,750
A bomb's just exploded.

206
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,416
We're all dead.

207
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,791
Laser sensors.
Technology is wonderful, isn't it?

208
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,916
Internet and hidden
or replicated IP addresses.

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,916
With the money we have, we could buy
a satellite in Kazakhstan.

210
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,708
But that would only take us to one place.

211
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,583
The shittiest place.

212
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,125
You fight technology with technology.

213
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,833
In this, the government can win, but...

214
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,875
there's something
in which they can't compete with:

215
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,708
Time travel.

216
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,000
1941.

217
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,666
Made in England.

218
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,166
With these devices, the BBC broadcast
from Great Britain to the whole world.

219
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,791
Shortwave, ladies and gentlemen.

220
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,208
No technology can inhibit such
a frequency. We'll talk through here.

221
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,416
Everyone could listen in on us with that.

222
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,250
Yes, Nairobi. Every moron with
a walkie-talkie will be able to hear us.

223
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,833
But...

224
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,208
will they be able to understand us?

225
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,833
Absolutely not.

226
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,666
Computer encodings.

227
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,750
In the broadcast
and in the reception as well.

228
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,416
These encodings won't be easy.

229
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,916
We will put in 2300 layers.

230
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,750
They can bring
200 million Chinese ballbusters,

231
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,250
and they'd still never decode it.

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Synchronization.

233
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,250
Monks. "Come Creator Spirit...

234
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,375
and in our hearts take up Thy rest...

235
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,666
come with Thy grace and heavenly aid."

236
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,375
We'll have them there...

237
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,458
erasing layer after layer.

238
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,500
Cursing our mothers.

239
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,500
A hundred brainiacs

240
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,166
who are desperate.

241
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,833
A waste of public funds for nothing.

242
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,750
Because with every call we make,

243
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,083
we add 2300 more layers.

244
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,666
A call...

245
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,416
and a code.

246
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
A call...

247
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,375
and a code.

248
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,291
If it's a coded system, then decode it!

249
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:30,500
Bring the whole tech research unit.
They have to start working now!

250
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,291
Very well.

251
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:39,250
In two minutes, I want everyone
with the vests and masks on.

252
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,541
We will give you guns, too.

253
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,666
Fake guns.

254
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,916
Don't get too excited.

255
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,625
Amanda, right?

256
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,958
- I'm...
- Miguel.

257
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,291
You know my name?

258
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,250
Well, you told the robber before.

259
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,625
One day, I saved your Tupperware.
I don't know if you remember...

260
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,541
No.

261
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,625
I really don't.

262
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,958
Put the vests on now!

263
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,875
Come on, things are going to get tough.

264
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:08,875
Don't put it on!

265
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,583
What?

266
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,666
Don't put it on.

267
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,500
You all, don't put the vests on!

268
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,375
They want to use us as human shields.

269
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,166
It's true. Don't put it on.

270
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,875
We found him.

271
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,041
The smartest kid in class.

272
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,041
The overachiever.

273
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,500
- No, I am not.
- You aren't?

274
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,000
What's your name?

275
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,625
- Miguel, Miguel.
- Miguel, Miguel.

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,250
Miguel, I'm Mr. Denver.

277
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Mr. Denver. I'm Miguel.

278
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,708
Miguel, do you like movies?

279
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,250
No, sir. I watch TV shows.

280
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,416
Get with the program,

281
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,208
because we're playing "Guess the Movie."

282
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,541
Put the vest on!

283
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,083
Give me that.

284
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,833
It's backwards, Miguel.

285
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,291
Good.

286
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,083
You're going to put this on, too.

287
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,333
If you don't, I will hurt you.

288
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,541
Hurry up!

289
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,583
Good.

290
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,333
I am going to take seven steps.

291
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,333
Then I will shoot.

292
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,500
If you guess the movie
before I turn around,

293
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,708
maybe I won't shoot you.

294
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,166
Mr. Denver...

295
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,666
Miguel is a robot.

296
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,583
One.

297
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,708
Two.

298
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,916
Three. Okay, Miguel,
I will give you another clue.

299
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,875
I am also a robot.

300
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,166
Four.

301
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,583
<i>WALL-E.</i> It's <i>WALL-E.</i>

302
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,583
I come naked from the future, Miguel.

303
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,708
<i>- WALL-E.</i>
- No, no, no.

304
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,708
- No.
<i>- WALL-E?</i>

305
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,625
Are you calling me <i>WALL-E,</i> Miguel?

306
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,000
No, Mr. Denver.

307
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,333
<i>Terminator.</i>

308
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,833
I'm the <i>Terminator.</i>

309
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,041
Hasta la vista, baby.

310
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,541
The show is over!

311
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,958
Come on. Form two lines.

312
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,708
Quickly!

313
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,458
Come on.

314
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,041
Come on, the masks.

315
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,833
Put the vests and the masks on!

316
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,166
Who the fuck forgot
to turn off their phone?

317
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,375
I'm sorry, it's mine.

318
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,833
HIDDEN NUMBER

319
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,625
Yes?

320
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,166
<i>Good morning, Colonel Prieto.
I'm the Professor.</i>

321
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>I hope you're feeling better.</i>

322
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hello, Professor.

323
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,125
<i>I'm sorry for taking you away
from the dentist in such a way.</i>

324
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,875
<i>I hope I'm not bothering you too much.</i>

325
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,583
You are never a bother, Professor.

326
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,083
<i>Colonel, help me,
because I'm a little bit confused.</i>

327
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,500
Are you in charge of the operation?

328
00:16:58,916 --> 00:16:59,958
Or is it Tamayo?

329
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,375
Colonel Tamayo speaking.

330
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,500
<i>From now on, I'm in charge.</i>

331
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,625
It's a pleasure to meet you.

332
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,541
NEGOTIATION

333
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,916
On this occasion, we'll be the ones
making the calls. Never them.

334
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,916
And we'll do it with phones,
but they won't be able to track our calls.

335
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,583
Why?

336
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,541
Because we're going to travel to the past.

337
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,416
I had that one for five years
and I only had to charge it once.

338
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,375
Second-generation phones.

339
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,500
No Internet and especially no GPS.

340
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,791
With these phones,
we will only make one call. Only one,

341
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,625
no more, to an external collaborator.

342
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,291
- Marseille.
- What? The mute guy isn't coming?

343
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,375
- I'm not mute.
- Like your rat that makes these sounds:

344
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,500
It isn't a rat.

345
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,791
Her name is Sofía.

346
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,750
Marseille will have two terminals.

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,833
On the first one, he will receive my call.

348
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,458
On the second one,

349
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,875
he will call the only number
in the telephone's contacts:

350
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,958
Colonel Prieto's.

351
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,916
These two phones will be our firewalls.

352
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,791
Archaic.

353
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:18,916
<i>Rudimentary.</i>

354
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,208
But efficient.

355
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:31,375
The police can pinpoint the phone
that's emitting the signal

356
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,500
when the call is being made,
and only then.

357
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,916
<i>There's no technology capable of tracking</i>

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,875
<i>two mobile phones stuck together in a box</i>

359
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,083
that are constantly on the move.

360
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,625
Besides, without GPS

361
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,916
<i>or Internet, the only thing</i>

362
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,666
<i>they will have is the antenna</i>

363
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,790
<i>that connects to that phone
when the call is placed.</i>

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,166
An antenna that's located

365
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,000
<i>in the center of Madrid.</i>

366
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,958
<i>Right under their noses.</i>

367
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,500
<i>That's the only thing they will have.</i>

368
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,291
That means...

369
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,958
they have nothing.

370
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,708
<i>I'm sorry, but we don't know each other,</i>

371
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,416
<i>so I would like to ask you a question.</i>

372
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,208
Are you in love?

373
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:17,583
I've been married for more than 17 years,
something uncommon nowadays.

374
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,166
<i>That's the irrefutable proof of my love,</i>

375
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,083
- <i>Professor.</i>
- Yes. I see.

376
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,500
However, and excuse me again,
I don't think you are.

377
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,416
Because when someone is in love,
life becomes rose-tinted.

378
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,083
Everything looks beautiful
and one turns into a kind of teddy bear

379
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,541
that smiles constantly.

380
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,291
<i>Someone in love doesn't shout</i>

381
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,458
or insult his coworkers so rudely.
That's why I asked.

382
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,958
I know you've been listening to us,
you piece of shit.

383
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,416
Colonel,

384
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,916
think about the last time you made love.

385
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,041
Look, Professor, you can go to hell
with these bullshit conversations.

386
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,791
Colonel, you've just joined us,
so allow me to remind you what

387
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,666
the first lines of CNI's handbook
say about hostage negotiations.

388
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,958
They literally say: "Listen attentively
to understand the kidnapper's psychology.

389
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,375
Show empathy towards them
and let them know

390
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,625
that you understand their feelings."

391
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,291
Do you know what?

392
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,666
I think you're blind and deaf now.

393
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,208
<i>That's why Prieto's phone rang a second
before he was going to leave.</i>

394
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,916
I'm starting to think
you're really screwed, Professor.

395
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,625
<i>This isn't the paradisal island
where you probably spent your days</i>

396
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,541
after the Royal Mint robbery, am I right?

397
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,875
How did the escape go?

398
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,833
<i>How is Murillo?</i>

399
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,291
Hello, Colonel Tamayo.

400
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,625
<i>Colonel Prieto.</i>

401
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,916
Ángel.

402
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,458
<i>I imagine you're also there listening.</i>

403
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,416
Okay, do you have them there?
Don't lose them.

404
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,750
Hello, Raquel. How are you?

405
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,041
<i>We miss you here in the tent.</i>

406
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,791
Thank you.

407
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,541
And I'm sorry for leaving like that,
without a goodbye.

408
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:09,958
<i>How are you?</i>

409
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,708
Well, you know me.

410
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,583
I always keep fighting.

411
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,000
And how is Mari Carmen?

412
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,625
Mari Carmen...

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
She left me.

414
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,833
It took her too long, don't you think?

415
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,791
I'm very sorry, Ángel.

416
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,625
Colonel, the antenna is
on Princesa Street.

417
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,291
Fuck me! They're so close.

418
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,375
Raquel, what the fuck are you doing?

419
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,291
<i>You're throwing your life away.</i>

420
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,166
Look...

421
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,250
This is my new life.

422
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,916
And do you know what?

423
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,583
It's a thousand times better
than the previous one.

424
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,083
Do you think you're living in a movie?

425
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,916
Listen, Raquel.

426
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,458
<i>Movies end, and not always
with a happy ending.</i>

427
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,791
You know I'm going to go after you,
don't you?

428
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,666
That's nothing new.

429
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,875
You've always chased me.

430
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,750
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Colonel, are you still there?

431
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,541
<i>Listen, I am going to call you
in one hour.</i>

432
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,958
By then, I will have released
five hostages.

433
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,708
This time, we'll do things right.

434
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,708
In an hour, I will be smoking a cigar
in your name in the governor's office.

435
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,208
Colonel, I'm recording this conversation.

436
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,541
It sounds like you don't care
about the hostages.

437
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,583
If it's recorded, I am going to give you
some advice, so you won't forget it.

438
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,041
Take your mask, your machine gun,

439
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,125
and get ready.

440
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,875
Because all hell's going to break loose
on your heads.

441
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,458
What do we know about that phone?

442
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,500
They must have made
the call from an old phone.

443
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,708
It was impossible to access
its geolocation,

444
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,833
but the conversation connected
with two antennas.

445
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,916
On Princesa and Callao.

446
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,208
What does that mean?

447
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,017
It could be because there's
a high concentration of people in the area

448
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,458
or they've been on the move.

449
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:08,000
Are you telling me that they were
on a walk while they were talking to us?

450
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:12,458
I want all available units deployed
and checking everyone's IDs.

451
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,208
Colonel, we're talking about more
than 400,000 people.

452
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,083
People must be spending
the bills they threw.

453
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:23,083
And the absence of background noise may
mean they weren't calling from the street.

454
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,958
Maybe it's a basement
or the metro tunnels.

455
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,541
It's impossible to know for sure.

456
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,708
Four hours.

457
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,833
Look at you,
you look so innocent like this.

458
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,625
I want a son like this one.

459
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,083
And these guys?

460
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,416
- What the hell are they doing?
- I don't know.

461
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,541
I think they're breaking records.

462
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,208
Let me tell you,
I think he has to be really weird

463
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,291
as a boyfriend.

464
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,625
What's wrong?

465
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,416
Nothing.

466
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,723
You're having second thoughts, don't you?

467
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,291
Do you want to turn back?

468
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,416
We need to perfect...

469
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,250
the plan.

470
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,708
At least, for...

471
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,333
four months.

472
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,333
- Four months?
- Four months.

473
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,750
What are you going to say to Tokyo?

474
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,953
That the next time she sees Rio,
he'll be a vegetable?

475
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,916
We can't help Rio

476
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,375
with a plan that doesn't work.

477
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,541
It doesn't work?

478
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,625
We've studied it together.
It's a perfect plan.

479
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,166
No, it isn't. It isn't.

480
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,916
Do you know what's wrong with you?

481
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,916
You've become an egomaniac.

482
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,208
You don't trust the plan
because it isn't yours.

483
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,541
It's your brother's plan,
but he did trust you.

484
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,333
Why did you want to join

485
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:38,958
the robbery so badly?

486
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,916
Why are you so anxious about it?

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,333
You're like those people who quit smoking

488
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:49,208
and then start hating tobacco
and the smoke and people who smoke,

489
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:51,541
and they become
the biggest Taliban against tobacco.

490
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,416
That's happening to you with the police.

491
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,791
You hate the police
because they destroyed your life,

492
00:25:56,875 --> 00:26:00,125
because they tried
to take your daughter away,

493
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,375
because there's an arrest warrant
issued against you

494
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,416
and you want revenge. Revenge.

495
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:08,416
And you aren't thinking
about Tokyo, Rio or Berlin.

496
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,660
You're thinking about yourself.
And if that's the case,

497
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:13,583
then I don't think
you should be part of the plan.

498
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,875
I need more time.

499
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,291
07:48

500
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,583
- 07:47
- 07:46

501
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,916
Get better, I will take care of this.

502
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,666
- Hello.
- This way, please.

503
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,750
Of course.

504
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,625
At your service, inspector.

505
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,125
You know them.

506
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:21,458
In the absence of Fonollosa, alias Berlin,
who do think could've taken charge?

507
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,791
Why?

508
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,125
What do you mean?

509
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,041
Why do you care?

510
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
If we kill whoever is in charge first,

511
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,833
we may not have to kill all of them.

512
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,333
Did I answer you?

513
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,791
Denver.

514
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,916
No doubt. He's the most seasoned.
Moscow's son.

515
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,083
- Denver. Believe me.
- Are you sure?

516
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,458
Absolutely. I know them well.

517
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,000
Look, Helsinki is a war criminal.

518
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,041
He only knows how to obey orders.

519
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,000
Nairobi.

520
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,250
Nairobi staged a coup inside the Mint
and took power from Fonollosa.

521
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,053
The Professor would never
put her in charge.

522
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,666
And Tokyo?

523
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,833
Tokyo...

524
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,625
She's too unstable.

525
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,208
Hot-blooded.
It was her fault that Moscow died. No.

526
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,833
Tokyo couldn't be in charge of anything.

527
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,666
Listen to me. It's Denver.

528
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,875
Denver.

529
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,541
What was that?

530
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,958
To see if you would come talk to me.

531
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,041
Look. It worked.

532
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,500
You're not fine, Denver.

533
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,791
I know.

534
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,250
I know I'm not fine, but not because...

535
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:59,208
all that shit you told me
about being sexist and all that.

536
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:00,833
It's something else.

537
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,541
Hey.

538
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,708
What's wrong?

539
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,125
Come on, tell me.

540
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,666
- I know how this ends.
- No.

541
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,791
- No, this doesn't end in any way.
- They killed my father.

542
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,708
And you know it.

543
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,208
And it happened because she

544
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,666
wanted a grand entrance
with a motorcycle. Right, Tokyo?

545
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,041
He was a good man.

546
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:44,416
And he acted like a father in front
of 200 policemen with an M16 and no vest.

547
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,333
And they killed him.

548
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,208
Do you know what I'm saying?

549
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,916
If you're here,

550
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,666
the same will happen to me,
because I am not cold-blooded.

551
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,583
If I have to stand in the line of fire
to protect you, I will.

552
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,833
I don't care.

553
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,375
Because you're my family, Mónica.

554
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:06,958
You're my family.

555
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,708
And that's why I didn't want you here.

556
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:13,666
Do you understand?

557
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,416
Step.

558
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,083
Step, step. Sorry.

559
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,500
Well, I will take care of the Browning.

560
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,791
Very well, Helsinki. Good luck.

561
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,208
Let's go inside.

562
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You, too.

563
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,750
You don't know what you're doing.

564
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,000
As soon as I touch
the door of that chamber,

565
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,166
the security system
will flood it in a few minutes.

566
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:07,041
It will be flooded? No.

567
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,541
More than 100,000 liters of water
will crush you.

568
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,833
More than 100,000 liters of water,
Nairobi.

569
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:12,916
Did you hear?

570
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,541
I hope you took a course on snorkeling.

571
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,791
You're wrong if you think
you're dealing with an idiot.

572
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,833
I know where you're taking me.

573
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:22,708
And why.

574
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,625
And let me tell you,

575
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,208
I won't do it.

576
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,041
Let's go.

577
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,958
Put this on right now.

578
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,041
Please.

579
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,416
Ma'am.

580
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,375
Get out of line.

581
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,708
No, I can, I can. My hands are strong.

582
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,125
Ma'am.

583
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,041
Get out of line, please.

584
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,416
And the rest of you, keep working!

585
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,583
Thank you.

586
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,166
Tokyo.

587
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,791
I watched the other robbery,
glued to the TV.

588
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,666
I know you all.

589
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:54,833
Sit down.

590
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,500
Helicopters, take off.

591
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:08,958
Now.

592
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,375
Come on, come on, come on.

593
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,458
Hurry up with those sacks. Don't stop.

594
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,416
If something goes wrong,

595
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,833
then we will find ourselves
in the worst-case scenario.

596
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,875
In which they will start the assault
before we can open

597
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,333
that little door.

598
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:38,000
And opening that door would take
a lot longer than the first one.

599
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,250
And only he could do this.

600
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,208
A minimum of two hours.

601
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,291
Two hours.

602
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:50,416
If we haven't opened it
before they enter, then...

603
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:52,833
We're dead.

604
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,416
But we have a solution.

605
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,833
There's always a solution.

606
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,458
We have this small baby.

607
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,583
A dolphin.

608
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,666
Well, we didn't have more divers.

609
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,208
We're calling him Flipper.

610
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:06,833
Do you remember Flipper?

611
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,791
The trained dolphin that clapped.

612
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,583
He saved lives, too.

613
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,750
If necessary, he will have to save ours.

614
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,708
The governor of the Bank of Spain
is the only one who can open that door

615
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:18,916
in three seconds.

616
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,125
With this button,
we balance the jacket's buoyancy.

617
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,833
I will do it. Don't press it
or you will end up stuck on the ceiling.

618
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:30,791
Hey!

619
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,333
Are you here with us?

620
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,958
We have an emergency respirator.

621
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,458
Hopefully, we won't need to use it.

622
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,833
Hey, look at me.

623
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,833
Look at me!

624
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,791
Once inside,
you'll notice the change of pressure.

625
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,208
Don't get scared and above all,
don't stop breathing.

626
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,291
Yes, but we have a problem.

627
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,625
He won't do it.

628
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,208
His entire biography
says he has principles.

629
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,666
Everyone has principles.

630
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,375
The governor has to ask himself:
"What's more important,

631
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,291
my principles

632
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:07,625
or my life?"

633
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,708
We're running out of time.

634
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:12,875
Let's go, let's go.

635
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,583
Governor, any questions?

636
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,083
I'm not going in.

637
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,833
I think you are.

638
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:22,541
- Get into the bathyscaphe. Now.
- Now.

639
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,208
<i>Assault teams in position.</i>

640
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,541
<i>Armored units waiting.</i>

641
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,000
Gentlemen,

642
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,708
two minutes and thirty seconds.

643
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,500
02:3002:30

644
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,623
- 02:2902:29
- 02:2802:28

645
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,708
Okay. Hasta-la-vista-Baby's line
follows Stockholm.

646
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,958
The rest come with me.

647
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,083
You heard her. Come on, fast.

648
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,041
Fast!

649
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,125
Fast!

650
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,916
Come on, come on, come on.

651
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,208
To the end of the room.

652
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,750
- Fast.
- Come on, come on.

653
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,250
If I put your mask on myself,

654
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,973
you won't be able to take if off
for the rest of your fucking life.

655
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,083
Put it on, Governor, put it on.

656
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,208
No?

657
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,250
- Free diving, then. Go.
- Release me!

658
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,041
I'm not going in.

659
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,541
He is 60 years old

660
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,875
- and has coronary heart disease.
- Well, man...

661
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,166
better for us.

662
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,458
Exactly, the coronary heart disease,

663
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,458
the bathyscaphe, the 20 atmospheres...

664
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:21,125
Just thinking about all that will give him
an astonishing lucidity.

665
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,750
This whole plan depends
on the decision of a man.

666
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,708
And I'm pretty sure
he will decide not to do it.

667
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:30,625
Do you know when he will have
his ultimate moment of lucidity?

668
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,416
Once he gets into that flooded chamber

669
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,083
and realizes he can't escape.

670
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,500
Once he decides his life depends
on us opening that door...

671
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:44,958
or closing off his oxygen.

672
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:48,375
Sergio, if you had to choose between
your decency and your oxygen,

673
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,500
what would you pick?

674
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,750
He won't go inside.

675
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,208
He will.

676
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,750
We'll have to push him a little bit...

677
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,458
but he will.

678
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:01,791
You fucked it up, peanut.

679
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,083
Matías, the bolt cutters.

680
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,416
They cut so fucking well.

681
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,458
Tell me the code or you will count bills

682
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,541
with your fucking stumps.

683
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,416
Fuck, Governor.

684
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,666
What a brave idiot.

685
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,916
- Oh, my God!
- Denver!

686
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,750
Denver, what the fuck did you do?

687
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,291
For God's sake!
Someone tell me what's happening!

688
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,083
Grab this.

689
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,750
Governor.

690
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,208
Governor, Mario.

691
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,083
Mario.

692
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,041
Fuck me! Fuck's sake!

693
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:38,833
What's up, Nairobi?

694
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,916
He lost consciousness.

695
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
For God's sake!

696
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,333
One hundred thirty beats.
He's going to suffer a heart attack.

697
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,816
- How much time do we have left?
- One minute and 20 seconds.

698
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:48,958
That much?

699
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,833
Matías, the first-aid kit and the staples.
We have to close the wound.

700
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:53,916
- Quickly!
- Denver!

701
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,375
Cover his wound, fuck!

702
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:56,708
OK, OK.

703
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:58,208
Hurry up, Denver!

704
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,500
What if, for any reason,

705
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:06,125
he decides not to open that door?

706
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,708
There are always risks.

707
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,625
Brother, please.

708
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,291
What would life be without risks?

709
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,166
Brother, that's what makes life exciting.

710
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,458
If something goes wrong,

711
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,625
we will always have the C-4.

712
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:24,041
Bogotá.

713
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:26,875
Be careful, brother.

714
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,416
Go, go, go.

715
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,625
Come on, without fear. Fuck! Without fear.

716
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,958
Fast, fast, fast!

717
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:43,000
Pulse at 150.
This guy is going to explode.

718
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,083
<i>C-4 inside there?</i>

719
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,541
<i>Also called RDX,</i>

720
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:48,000
or popularly known as plastic explosive.

721
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,083
You're crazy!

722
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,666
Well, it's unpredictable.

723
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,208
Uncouth, even, but exciting.

724
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,333
Even the river is going to tremble.

725
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,625
Gentlemen, we're going in.

726
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,083
We know the priority target,

727
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,666
but we have the green light to fire on
any member of the gang.

728
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:12,750
The presence of at least
a hundred hostages is confirmed.

729
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,833
...blocked-off streets and the whole
country looking at the Bank of Spain.

730
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:19,583
A special operations unit
has been deployed

731
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:23,625
<i>and armored cars and assault vehicles
have been seen driving around.</i>

732
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:27,291
<i>And for a few minutes ago, helicopters
have been heard overhead as well.</i>

733
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,208
- 00:52
- 00:51

734
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,666
Ten milligrams of diazepam.

735
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,083
For fuck's sake!

736
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,250
Come on!

737
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,041
Come on. Okay.

738
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:47,791
<i>A blast wave at 50 meters underwater,</i>

739
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:52,083
liberating a pressure of 40 atmospheres,
not even God knows what can happen there.

740
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,125
Denver, remind me to beat you up
as soon as this ends.

741
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,750
Fucking idiot!

742
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,583
A small big bang,
but that's how life starts.

743
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,583
No, it isn't going down. Give me another.

744
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,500
Please! Please!

745
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,208
- 09
- 08

746
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,791
Okay, okay.

747
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,458
- 08
- 07

748
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,041
- 07
- 06

749
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:35,833
- 03
- 02

750
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
- 01
- 00

751
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,250
It's true that it could damage
part of what's inside the safe,

752
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,791
but it will open it for sure.

753
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,250
God!
