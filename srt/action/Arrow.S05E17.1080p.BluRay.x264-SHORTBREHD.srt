1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,261
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,799
I have a village, too,
run by a government strongman named Kovar.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,892
You will go to Russia and find my parents,

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,935
and tell them what happened
to me and Vlad.

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,396
Taiana, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,528
Tell me who this "Prometheus" is.

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,200
I guess you know
what I've been up to, huh?

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,444
Remember, I'm always ten steps
ahead of you.

9
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,493
- What's <i>going</i> on?
- Chase is gone.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,950
- So is Oliver.
- We have to assume Chase has him.

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,751
Just make sure he suffers.

12
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,917
That was always the plan.

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,169
<i>PROMETHEUS". Did you hesitate at all</i>

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,375
<i>- when you killed him?</i>

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,632
<i>Or was he just another name
you crossed off your list?</i>

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,715
<i>If you kill me,
you'll only really be killing yourself.</i>

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,019
<i>Five, four, three, two, one...</i>

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,564
Hundred and forty-five seconds.

19
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,155
That's how long my father struggled
under the water before he died.

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,902
According to my father's autopsy,
your arrow pierced his aortic arch,

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,236
but it didn't kill him.

22
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,784
No, he was still conscious enough

23
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,459
to feel his lungs filling with water
for 145 seconds.

24
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,411
And here you were

25
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,707
bragging about a plan
more intricate than torture.

26
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,969
Did you ever think about
why I chose the name Prometheus?

27
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,095
He challenged the omnipotence of the gods.

28
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,850
See, because like you,
they play judge, jury and executioner.

29
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,402
But Prometheus took away their power.

30
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,771
If that's what you're gonna do to me,

31
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,363
you'll need to come up with something
better than whatever this is.

32
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,657
I did.

33
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,703
And the only way for you to stop it

34
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,038
is to confess.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,295
- I killed your father.
- Nothing so pedestrian.

36
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,757
I want you to tell me your secret, Oliver.

37
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,885
I want you to confess to the one thing

38
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,092
that you've been afraid
to admit to yourself.

39
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,048
How many times am I going to tell you

40
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,216
that I don't know
what you're talking about?

41
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,348
Fine.

42
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,680
You'll come around eventually.

43
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,728
Now, where were we?

44
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,815
One forty-five, one forty-four,
one forty-three...

45
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,118
Bandages and water will not help me.

46
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,079
Before you die, tell us what you meant.

47
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,289
You said if we kill you,
we kill ourselves.

48
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,578
<i>Why'?</i>

49
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,836
You will find out soon enough.

50
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,130
You're gonna tell me now

51
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,134
or I'm going to dig that
bullet out of your arm.

52
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,552
Go to hell.

53
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,350
Oliver! Oliver!

54
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,344
What are you doing?

55
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,600
He will never tell you truth
in that much pain.

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,779
Does this has to do with your deal
with Kovar, yes?

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
<i>Samovol'shchina.</i>

58
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,533
If you know what it was or what is coming,

59
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,661
you will beg Kovar to spare you.

60
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,126
And you are no one's hero.

61
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,212
Everything

62
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,048
and everyone that you love,

63
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,346
will wither

64
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,592
<i>and die at your touch.</i>

65
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,567
<i>Da.</i>

66
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,281
Good riddance.

67
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,571
What do we do about Kovar?

68
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,160
What does it matter?

69
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,243
Our Pakhan is dead.
We must swear in a new one.

70
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,751
<i>ANATOLY". There are men loyal to us,</i>

71
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,288
and men loyal to Gregor,
all without Pakhan.

72
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,543
How do we choose a new one?

73
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,167
Pakhan is determined by seniority.

74
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,973
Why is he doing that?

75
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,813
It's for journey to afterlife.

76
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,190
Makes good gift in heaven,

77
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,856
but even better bribe for Satan.

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,611
<i>Da.</i>

79
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,710
You can get in there, too.
You're one of us.

80
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,941
<i>AY-.</i>

81
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,403
Viktor, I think he cut into tendon.

82
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,571
I don't think he's very happy
you're Pakhan.

83
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,873
You think? I know.

84
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,995
I wish there was less painful transfer
of power in Bratva.

85
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,670
What are we gonna do about Kovar?

86
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,791
You're asking for yourself
or you're asking for Bratva?

87
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,593
Anatoly, Gregor made it sound like
all of us were going to be killed.

88
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,919
<i>Samovol'shchina.</i>

89
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,088
"Do as you will."
But he made it sound like there was some...

90
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,600
Some deeper meaning? Yeah, it comes from
Russian Revolution, 1917.

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,302
Why is he quoting the Russian Revolution?

92
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,768
I can't think of any good reason.
Maybe ask Kovar when I talk to him.

93
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:29,973
What?

94
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,351
You can't meet with Kovar.

95
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,020
Kovar had deal with Gregor.
Gregor is dead.

96
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,116
As new Pakhan, I have to meet with him,
he will suspect something is up.

97
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,779
- I could try to talk to Galina.
- To who?

98
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,323
- I told you about Taiana.
- Oh, yes.

99
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,585
Galina is her mother
and she works for Kovar.

100
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,046
Maybe she heard something.

101
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,558
Oh!

102
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,528
Your boss, you work for Konstantin Kovar?

103
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,411
- He said you were enemy.
- No, no.

104
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,408
- A bad man.
- No, no, no.

105
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,078
I'm friends with Taiana.

106
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,038
My precious Taiana?

107
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,167
Well, we're friends.
And I could use your help.

108
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,214
- With some things...
- Mmm-hmm.

109
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,602
Wait, I'm not gonna hurt you,
I'm not gonna hurt you. Listen to me.

110
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,945
When Kovar hears about this,
you cannot say you saw me,

111
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,273
do you understand?
You say you saw me, he'll hurt you.

112
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,608
All right? All right.

113
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,411
<i>KOVAR". My father once told me,</i>

114
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,956
"Do not have 100 rubles,

115
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,325
"but have 100 friends."

116
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,789
Fortunately for us,
we have both friends and money.

117
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,086
Yes, I assume your presence here means
that our arrangement has borne fruit?

118
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,256
The shipment was routed to this location.

119
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,676
The BIC codes are inside.
All you have to do is retrieve it.

120
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,638
And as for my compensation,
I think that...

121
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,686
Unidac Industries, yes.

122
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,979
I will make sure you get
the information you desire.

123
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,524
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some other business to attend to.

124
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,862
My apologies.

125
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,372
Malcolm Merlyn,
CEO of Merlyn Global Group.

126
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,117
Anatoly Knyazev, gangster.

127
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:05,091
You undercut your new station,
Mr. Knyazev.

128
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,803
Pakhan of the Solntsevskaya Bratva,
it's...

129
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,885
It's no small feat.

130
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,936
<i>Nor</i> is <i>samovol'shchina.</i>

131
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,314
One of Gregor's last words.

132
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,188
And, uh...

133
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,236
Were his other last words
about who killed him?

134
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,489
He called the man <i>Kapiushon.</i>

135
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,777
- Hood.

136
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,827
The reports of man with a bow and arrow

137
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,833
are disrupting business,
Bratva and otherwise.

138
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,339
It's interesting.
I heard some reports of my own...

139
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,802
Of you having trouble with Gregor
because of his deal with me.

140
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,134
I questioned it, yes.

141
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,848
<i>Now that</i> I <i>am Pakhan,</i>

142
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,512
I'm obligated to live up to commitments
that he made.

143
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,014
<i>Such</i> as <i>samovol'shchina?</i>

144
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,733
You study history, Mr. Knyazev?

145
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,028
When the Soviet Union was dissolved,

146
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,532
many thought that
the capitalist opportunities will

147
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,364
give rise to a more stronger,

148
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,696
a more united Russian people.

149
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,038
But then powerful men at the KGB,
Communist Party,

150
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,046
the Komsomol, they decided to
cash in on their privileges.

151
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,706
And, uh...

152
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,381
Russia became not stronger,

153
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,548
but diseased.

154
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,348
And samovol'shchina was the cure once.

155
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,064
It could be so again.

156
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,029
Right, what does that mean?

157
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:50,283
It means Kovar is planning something
very big and very terrible.

158
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,193
What is he gonna do?

159
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,041
Oliver, maybe time is best
for you to go back to America.

160
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,325
Anatoly.

161
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,286
We're brothers.

162
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,956
What's happening to you
is happening to me.

163
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,425
Kovar is going to overthrow
Russian government.

164
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,757
<i>Samovol'shchina</i> is <i>coup.</i>

165
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,763
And, I mean, he just told you this?

166
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,429
Before I got there, he was making deal
with American businessman.

167
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,099
Some secret, sensitive shipment.

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,516
Do you think it's a weapon?

169
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,562
Kovar has many men,
but not enough for a coup.

170
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,480
But with weapon...

171
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,775
Luckily, I got a chance to see
the file they're working on,

172
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,869
Orekhovo-Zuyevo.

173
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,451
It is a shipyard in Moscow.

174
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,958
Then we go to the shipyard.
We stop Kovar from retrieving it.

175
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,915
Seeing you take bullets out of Gregor,

176
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,000
I saw him again.

177
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,041
Face of the monster.

178
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,345
This place, it's not good for you, Oliver.
Go home.

179
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,177
I didn't save you from Gregor

180
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,014
to stand by while you're murdered
by Kovar.

181
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,054
This isn't over for me.

182
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,691
So be it, brother.

183
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,795
Do they look familiar?

184
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,753
Do you even remember their faces?

185
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,843
These are your victims.

186
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:42,061
They were people who did terrible things.

187
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,898
They had victims.

188
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,684
And husbands. And wives.

189
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,942
Daughters.

190
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,978
Sons.

191
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,738
Confess your secret, Oliver,
and all of this ends.

192
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,204
I'll give you a gift, and you can walk out
that door and go back home.

193
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,910
Adrian, you're sick

194
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,377
and you're a hypocrite.

195
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,540
There is nothing that I've done
that compares with you.

196
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,713
Murdered your own wife...

197
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,301
Cecil Adams.

198
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,343
You knew him by his street name,
The Count.

199
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,688
You put three arrows in him.

200
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,724
He was gonna kill a friend of mine.

201
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,484
Felicity Smoak, yeah.

202
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,074
Confess or you get the same three arrows.

203
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,082
Go to hell.

204
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,080
I've already been there, Oliver.

205
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,670
And I've come back with a message for you.

206
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,934
- Are we all clear?
- Clear.

207
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,774
See how easy it is to think first,
and kill people later?

208
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,551
What is that?

209
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,589
Sarin gas. Enough to kill thousands.

210
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,145
What's next?

211
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,062
You said something
when I brought you here.

212
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,363
About how your friends are your strength.

213
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,689
Now...

214
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,656
She didn't even know
I was in her apartment.

215
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,073
Oh, I swear to God, if you hurt her...

216
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,828
<i>You'll do absolutely nothing.</i>

217
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,702
Because you're here.

218
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,755
You see, until you confess
your secret, Oliver,

219
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,842
everyone that you love is at play.

220
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,378
Even your son.

221
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,683
<i>You're bluffing.</i>

222
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,187
He's in hiding.

223
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,059
I don't even know where he is.

224
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,849
Because you haven't really looked.

225
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,519
But for me,
we both know it's just a matter of time.

226
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,363
<i>Confess.</i>

227
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,200
I don't know what you want me to say.

228
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,288
Then I guess I should leave you here
to think about it.

229
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,324
And wonder who I might kill
while I'm gone.

230
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,458
Adrian! Adrian, please!

231
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,753
All you have to do is say the words.

232
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,835
I...

233
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,427
That's what I thought.

234
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,546
See you soon.

235
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,601
We have incoming.

236
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,812
The truck!

237
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,815
Kovar has the Sarin gas.

238
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,190
Then we are all going to be dead men.

239
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,167
- How's Anatoly?
- Recovering.

240
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,453
Which is more than I can say for our men.

241
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,663
- The sarin gas get him?
- <i>Da</i>.

242
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,714
Where were you?

243
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,093
I was keeping Overwatch,
like Anatoly ordered.

244
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,178
You have something to say to me, Viktor,
so just say it.

245
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,768
It was your idea to go against Gregor.

246
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,513
Because of Kovar,
with your vendetta against him.

247
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,148
- Now look at the mess we're in.
- Well, do you have a better idea?

248
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,443
We should be honoring Gregor's pact
with Kovar. Not this.

249
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,112
The moment that Kovar
overthrows the government,

250
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,194
he is going to wipe out the entire Bratva.

251
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,484
Where are you going?

252
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,612
We have one of Kovar's men

253
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,372
and we need to know
where the gas is gonna be used.

254
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
Why would he tell you anything?

255
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,081
He won't be talking to me.

256
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,432
Please, I don't know anything.
There's no need to hurt me.

257
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,051
Quiet.

258
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,568
A friend of mine recently showed me
the skinning technique

259
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,274
used by hunters of Mongolia.

260
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,572
They remove all the skin
of things much larger than you

261
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,407
in less than five minutes.

262
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,529
Which means,

263
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,283
you don't have very long

264
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,703
to tell me what your boss is planning.

265
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,086
I don't know anything.

266
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,092
I was kind of hoping you would say that.

267
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,353
What is this monstrosity?

268
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,934
You should be resting.

269
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,900
I woke up with headache.
I came to find you,

270
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,602
I was not expecting this.

271
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,403
This is not human.

272
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,356
Anatoly, I told you.

273
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,775
Putting on this hood,

274
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,115
it helps me direct
the darkness inside of me.

275
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,122
And it worked, by the way.

276
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,999
I know what Kovar is planning.

277
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,830
<i>But at what cost?</i>

278
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,919
You're a fool to think a piece of cloth
can separate man from monster.

279
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,208
Dividing yourself in two

280
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,381
will only make monster stronger,
until it is stronger than you.

281
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,468
You knew what I was capable of
back on Lian Yu.

282
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,054
Yeah.

283
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,234
But this man I see now

284
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,149
bears more resemblance to Slade Wilson
or Anthony lvo.

285
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,493
Tough man.

286
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,868
Clearly withstood a lot before breaking.

287
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,792
He gave up pretty quickly.

288
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,965
The rest was me practicing.

289
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,760
Practicing to become what?

290
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,883
Something else.

291
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,220
Kovar's inviting key members
of the government,

292
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,224
politicians and military mostly,
to the opening of his casino.

293
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,727
And kill them with sarin gas,
even the innocents?

294
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,981
It's not good for business.

295
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,282
Yes, but being in charge of whole country
is good for business.

296
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,942
We need to get into that casino,

297
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,202
and we need to stop the attack
before it happens.

298
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,532
Place will be fortress,

299
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,657
increased security
for president and generals.

300
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,366
Impossible to break in.

301
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,160
Then what do you suggest we do?

302
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,953
We sneak in.

303
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,872
Without the help of someone
working for Kovar?

304
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,206
I know someone.

305
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,875
Well, if you're thinking about house lady,

306
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,255
last time it did not go so well.

307
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,007
Give me a second chance.

308
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,507
And if second chance doesn't work?

309
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,645
Mrs. Venediktov?

310
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,821
He's fine.

311
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,732
Well, he's unconscious, but... Look,

312
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,194
I'm sorry that I scared you
the other night.

313
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,574
I just, I need to speak with you. I...

314
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,912
Well, it's like I said,
I knew your children Taiana and Vlad.

315
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,829
Do you know what happened to them?

316
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,586
I'm sorry. They're dead.

317
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,760
But Mr. Kovar say
he's still looking for them.

318
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,924
Kovar is lying.

319
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,638
Before she died, Taiana,

320
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,520
she told me that he was a monster.

321
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,982
And she made me promise, she made me swear

322
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,355
that I would bring him to justice.

323
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,990
But even what you say is true,
what can I do?

324
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,988
Taiana told me that...

325
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,657
"The same hammer that shatters glass,

326
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:46,824
"forges steel."

327
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,287
I say to her as a child
to make her grow up strong.

328
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,453
Well, she did.

329
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,383
And she helped me grow strong, too.

330
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,629
Would you please,

331
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,931
please help me keep my promise to her?

332
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,769
This gets me into Mr. Kovar's buildings.

333
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,443
Thank you.

334
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,313
Make it right for them.

335
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,529
Uh...

336
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,656
Tell me,

337
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,660
who killed my children?

338
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,827
A monster.

339
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,897
What did you do to her?

340
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,020
I made her more compliant.

341
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,867
Get up.

342
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,949
Give yourself a chance.

343
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:15,871
I'm...

344
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,211
I'm not gonna fight her.

345
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,126
I don't want you to fight her.

346
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,885
I want you to kill her.

347
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,588
<i>I'm gonna leave now.</i>

348
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,099
When I come back,
either she's killed you and I let her go,

349
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,510
<i>or you kill her and I let you go.</i>

350
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,223
No. Neither one of those things
is gonna happen.

351
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,358
If you don't kill her,
you're gonna watch me snap her neck.

352
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:40,192
Adrian, what is the point of this?

353
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:45,284
You seem to be having a little bit of
trouble figuring out what your secret is.

354
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,864
I thought this might remind you.

355
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,405
Good luck.

356
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,752
I'm sorry, Oliver.

357
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,135
I can't take another day in here.

358
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,301
I think it's a...

359
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,955
Canisters are in a storeroom.

360
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,464
<i>Southwest corner. Second floor.</i>

361
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,881
Copy that.

362
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,927
<i>Okay, if you'd be so kind
to let us in now, please?</i>

363
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,676
- I'll meet you at the target.
<i>- Da</i>.

364
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,522
I took you into my home.

365
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,072
I gave you food and shelter.
This is how you repay me?

366
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,876
Now where?

367
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,421
I studied the map.
I know a shortcut. Here.

368
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,758
Are you sure this is the way?

369
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,931
Almost there.
Should be at the turn up ahead.

370
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,653
You sold us out.

371
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,069
We're in a casino, Anatoly.

372
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,994
I like to think of it as
playing the hand I was dealt.

373
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,190
Evelyn? Hey, look at me, listen to me.

374
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,481
I need you to bring the knife over here.

375
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,943
I want you to get me out of these things.

376
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,988
When he comes back...

377
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,865
We will ambush him.

378
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,828
No, we can't beat him.

379
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,835
I didn't know what I was buying into
when I sided with him. I...

380
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:31,172
It's okay. I forgive you. I, uh...

381
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,797
I just, I think that together,
we can get through this.

382
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,472
I'm dead.

383
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,015
That's all he kept telling me. I'm dead

384
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,647
because I was a part of your life.

385
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,355
Will you bring me the knife?

386
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,988
Will you bring me the knife,
and I can save us?

387
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,619
No!

388
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,870
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

389
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,004
Oh, my God!

390
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,134
Come on!

391
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,840
<i>Are we serious?</i>

392
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,381
Oliver, what are you trying to prove, man?

393
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,800
Evelyn betrayed you,
you've killed people for less.

394
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,437
I'm not gonna kill her,
I won't, just let her go.

395
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,810
You're forgetting what I told you

396
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,226
- would happen if you didn't kill her.
- No!

397
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,027
- No!
- Adrian, will you please, okay?

398
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,067
You have made your point.

399
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,403
Confess, Oliver. Tell me your secret.

400
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,907
I don't know what you want from me!

401
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,321
I want you to tell me what you've been

402
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,366
too afraid to tell your sister,
Felicity, Diggle.

403
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,909
Tell me!

404
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,415
I don't know! I don't.

405
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,716
Wrong answer.

406
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,358
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Finally, we're getting somewhere.

407
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,064
Confess.

408
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,663
<i>Oliver, we've been betrayed! Viktor,</i> he...

409
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,584
<i>KOVAR". I'm so very proud of this casino,</i>

410
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,178
and what it means for our country.

411
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,473
Well, that's why it saddens me
to tell you that

412
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,056
there was an attempt
by Solntsevskaya Bratva

413
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,312
to crash these festivities,

414
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:51,601
and assassinate every one of these
government officials here tonight.

415
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,314
But don't worry,

416
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,820
we have them all in custody.

417
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,197
<i>Yes.</i>

418
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,953
I'm told they planned
to stage a gas attack

419
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,291
in this very room.

420
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:20,175
<i>But, uh, sadly for them, even though they
were successful in launching the attack...</i>

421
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,765
<i>It backfired and</i>

422
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,303
killed every single one of them.

423
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,224
Well, at least,

424
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:33,651
that's what the newspapers
will report in the morning.

425
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,483
Good evening.

426
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,745
Confess.

427
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,620
<i>You killed my father
because he was a name on a list.</i>

428
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,161
But that's not really true, is it? No.

429
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,271
It's too late, <i>Kapiushon.</i>

430
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,307
<i>The gas has only done its work.</i>

431
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,858
The list was just an excuse.

432
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,895
The hood, the disguise, just an excuse.

433
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,778
The idea that all of this is
some heroic crusade, is just an excuse.

434
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,533
Excuse for what?

435
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,829
- Huh? Tell me!
- You tell me, Oliver.

436
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,704
You tell me.

437
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,075
Kill him.

438
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,845
Oliver Queen.

439
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,428
Who could have imagined?

440
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,853
I know what's going on
through your mind, Oliver.

441
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,943
You're thinking that you can get
yourself free from those chains,

442
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,367
lay me to the ground and snap my neck,
just like I did to Evelyn.

443
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,487
There it is.

444
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,743
There's the look I've been waiting to see.

445
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,783
But it's not just about stopping me,
is it?

446
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,372
No, there's something else in there.

447
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,212
Confess, Oliver.

448
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,342
When you see Taiana in the afterlife...

449
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,470
Give her a kiss for me.

450
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,821
- I'm going to finish this.
- No!

451
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,453
Are you going to let your Pakhan finish it
for you, Mr. Queen?

452
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,613
You don't have to do this, Oliver.

453
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,665
We both know that I do.

454
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,325
You don't have to, Oliver.
The man will face justice, I promise.

455
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,545
You're right.
He'll face justice.

456
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,517
<i>You've told yourself you kill
because you have to.</i>

457
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,596
Confess, Oliver.

458
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,732
You don't kill because you have to.
So, why...

459
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,769
- Why do you do it?
- Because I wanted to.

460
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,312
What?

461
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,814
I wanted to.

462
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,825
I wanted to!

463
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,736
And I liked it!

464
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,294
How's it feel?

465
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,712
Knowing that I saw the one thing
you couldn't admit to yourself?

466
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,717
<i>WOMAN". I knew he'd break.</i>

467
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,350
Just like you said he would.

468
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,732
<i>It's because I know him
better than he even knows himself.</i>

469
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,731
Give us a moment alone, would you?

470
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:59,241
I told you, Oliver.
You infect every life you touch.

471
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,164
<i>Now do you realize why?</i>

472
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:07,257
It's because your crusade
was based on a lie.

473
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,671
You used your father's memory
to justify a killing spree.

474
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,135
There's a price to be paid
for that, Oliver.

475
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,433
Your mother paid it.

476
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,898
Your friend Tommy paid it. Laurel.

477
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,018
Do you really want to tell me
that John Diggle and Felicity Smoak's

478
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,608
lives are better having known you?

479
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:34,906
You promised to let me go.

480
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,321
<i>And I'm</i> a <i>man of my word.</i>

481
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,455
But first, I have a gift for you.

482
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,663
This tattoo of yours.

483
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,423
To be an American
and named a Captain in the Bratva,

484
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,805
<i>you must have done
something extraordinary.</i>

485
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,057
When you look at it, it must...

486
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,890
It must remind you of such a victory.

487
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,768
Now when you look at it,

488
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,437
you'll think about our time here together.

489
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,990
And the secret that you confessed to me.

490
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,489
Whatever pain I caused you...

491
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,332
I'm sorry.

492
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,538
I believe you, Oliver.

493
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,333
I just don't care.

494
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,851
You know, I've decided.

495
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,182
You are my favorite American.

496
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,846
How many Americans do you know?

497
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,396
You and joking are not exactly
made for each other.

498
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,689
But that looks like it does.

499
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,196
Anatoly, why make me a Captain?

500
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,735
I'm not staying in Russia.

501
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,196
Because now anywhere you go in the world,

502
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,077
any Bratva you meet will know
what kind of man you are.

503
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,364
Come, I have another gift for you.

504
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,961
Here,

505
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,465
I recovered it from the casino.

506
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,051
Thank you.

507
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,927
You remember the first time
we met on Amazo?

508
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,094
I was performing surgery on myself.

509
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,849
That's kind of difficult to forget.

510
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,889
Yeah. What was it I said to you then?

511
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,520
"Living is not for the weak."

512
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,312
I cannot believe scared boy
in cell beside me

513
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,401
would be one to kill Konstantin Kovar.

514
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,361
Well, that wasn't me.

515
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,369
- That was him.
- That is a lie you tell yourself.

516
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,280
An excuse that allows you to kill.

517
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,242
But you kill because you like it.

518
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,831
That's not true, Anatoly, I hate it.

519
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,421
And I think maybe you've had
a bit too much to drink.

520
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,753
Well, that is entirely possible.

521
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,010
But in this case, lam right.

522
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,388
This deal you've sold yourself on,

523
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:05,178
like this hood is going to keep
this monster of yours at bay?

524
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,889
Someday it's going to fall apart.

525
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,315
And when it does,

526
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,774
you're not going to like the man
you see underneath.

527
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,194
Well?

528
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,036
It will take weeks
until he's back on his feet.

529
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,044
But he'll live. He gives you his thanks.

530
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,459
Just out of morbid curiosity,

531
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,460
who did this to him?

532
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,834
That's his business.

533
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,797
Well, whoever it is,

534
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,761
I'm glad I'm not him.

535
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,762
- How much longer?
- "How much longer?"

536
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,189
We've literally had to re-route
the electro-optical digital imaging

537
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,350
from every reconnaissance satellite
I could gain access to.

538
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,565
Then we had to capture data
in a four-dimensional array

539
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,402
which could then be parsed
using a real-time algorithm.

540
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,192
Basically, solving cold fusion
would have been easier.

541
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

542
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,244
Just been at this so long
I don't know which way is up.

543
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,371
And Oliver's been gone for six days and...

544
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,032
And, and what?

545
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,623
- Oliver? Oh, my God!
- Oliver?

546
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,136
Chase had me.

547
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,387
And he let me go.

548
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,518
Go slow, man.

549
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,684
It's over.

550
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,068
Oliver, we're gonna get this
son of a bitch for whatever he did to you.

551
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,533
John, it's...

552
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,072
It's over for me.

553
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,744
I don't wanna do this anymore.

554
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,257
I'm shutting everything down.
