1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:02,318
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:03,747
After 5 years in hell,

3
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:06,028
I returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,982
to save my city,

5
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:09,650
but my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:11,519
I had to become someone else.

7
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:12,687
I had to become

8
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,689
something else.

9
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:17,391
I had to become
the Green Arrow.

10
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:18,993
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:20,495
You won't be able
to stop him.

12
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:21,929
We need to trap him.

13
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,668
Dad?

14
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,836
We are the same,
you and I.

15
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:29,904
You are wrong.

16
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,405
I am nothing
like you.

17
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:34,675
John, voice-over: I had to put him
down, Lyla.

18
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:36,878
He had reached
for my gun.

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,546
Alex,
where are we?

20
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:39,847
- Thea.
- No. I can't.

21
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:41,149
Where are you going?

22
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,318
Rubicon--
designed to prevent

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,753
any country,
even our own,

24
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,555
from firing
a nuclear missile.

25
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:49,457
Darhk ripped it out.

26
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,092
Darhk would control the world's
nuclear stockpile.

27
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,960
Andy told me that
Genesis was coming.

28
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:55,029
God wanted to give the world a do-over,
so he destroyed it.

29
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,864
He destroyed
it with a flood.

30
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:58,699
So nuclear annihilation
is Darhk's flood.

31
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:01,169
What's he planning
on building as his ark?

32
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:50,885
Rubicon security
compromised.

33
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:53,154
Russia, Markovia,
Corto Maltese, us,

34
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,889
every NATO Ally--
Rubicon has control

35
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,824
over all their
nuclear systems.

36
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,354
You mean HIVE does.

37
00:01:58,355 --> 00:01:59,687
I know it's a little
late for this,

38
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,289
but whoever created
an algorithm

39
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,791
that could override
any country's nuclear weapons

40
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,226
really screwed up.

41
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,162
That would be
Amanda Waller.

42
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:09,897
How much time
do we have?

43
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,399
We?

44
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,234
Oliver, I'm
the director of Argus,

45
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:15,503
and this goes
way over my head.

46
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:16,871
This is
executive level,

47
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:18,506
and this is
Department of Defense.

48
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,174
Right, right, right, right,
but how much time?

49
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:21,509
There's a start-up
sequence

50
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,344
before Darhk can
actually launch a nuke.

51
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:25,079
We have just
under 21 hours.

52
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,748
You're gonna have to
find a way to interrupt that sequence.

53
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,850
Rubicon is a failsafe against
nuclear Armageddon.

54
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,952
Argus designed it
to be 100% unhackable.

55
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:33,421
No. She can do it.
She's the best.

56
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:34,722
Well, actually,
that would be my father

57
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:36,157
as far as Rubicon
is concerned.

58
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,625
It uses Fourier protocols.

59
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:40,028
Noah practically wrote
the book on them.

60
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,429
The world is facing
nuclear Armageddon.

61
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,930
My pride and my
general dislike for my father

62
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:45,099
can take a backseat
for the next 20-plus hours.

63
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,567
Felicity, this isn't
about pride.

64
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,969
Your father's
a criminal.

65
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,137
He can't be trusted.

66
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,671
I'm not saying
we should trust him.

67
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:53,241
I'm saying we need to.

68
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:55,376
Ok. He got out in Darhk's jailbreak.
How do we find him?

69
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:56,744
I'm already running
a search.

70
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:57,912
Can you try to get
in touch with Thea, too?

71
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,547
Please. We need her
back here.

72
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:01,349
John, can I talk
to you for a second?

73
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:06,921
- How you doing?
- Been better.

74
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:09,290
Well, I'm not gonna pretend to understand
what you're going through.

75
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:10,725
Well, Oliver, you've
been through this with your mother,

76
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,260
which is why I can't
quite understand

77
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:13,761
why you're putting
the fate of the world

78
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:14,962
in the hands
of another evil parent.

79
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,197
I'm not trusting
Kuttler.

80
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,598
I trust Felicity,

81
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,667
and we should just
let her do her job, ok?

82
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,169
We have one
of our own.

83
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,603
Yeah, stopping Darhk.

84
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:23,771
His magic is powered
by death,

85
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:25,873
so if even one
of those nukes hits--

86
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,975
he will be unstoppable.

87
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,410
Ok. What's your play?

88
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:30,978
Well, if he is planning
on harnessing

89
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,513
all of this death,
he's gonna be in something

90
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:33,981
called a Nexus chamber.

91
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:36,084
Basically, it's
a collector magic.

92
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:38,686
And here I thought earthquake machines
were as strange as it got.

93
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,855
Esrin Fortuna told me
that one of these chambers

94
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,457
exists in Star City.

95
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,692
I'm betting it falls
on a Ley line.

96
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:46,694
What did Vixen call
them--Wi-Fi for magic?

97
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,529
- Yeah.
- It's a big city, Oliver.

98
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:49,964
We got 21 hours.

99
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,432
One step at a time.

100
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,436
We have
to help them!

101
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,405
We're gonna help
these people!

102
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,642
What are you
looking for?

103
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:03,010
Reiter's men found
a way on the island.

104
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:05,279
There has to be
a way off.

105
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,415
There's a plane
east end of the island,

106
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,483
and it's far.

107
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:10,818
We'll make it.

108
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,019
What's that?

109
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,688
This may be a way
to call for help.

110
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,022
Let's go!

111
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,169
And...

112
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:29,670
Woof.

113
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:31,205
I know.

114
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:34,208
The predictability
was a terrible flaw in the design.

115
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,011
Predictability
is your flaw, too.

116
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,714
Every time my life
starts to suck, you show up.

117
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:42,416
Heh.

118
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,851
Leave us.

119
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:50,191
Is that hand a present from your
new best friend?

120
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:53,694
I'm not doing this
for a prosthetic, Thea.

121
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:56,264
I'm doing it
to keep you safe.

122
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,532
Keep me safe.

123
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:58,699
- Yes. Keep you safe.
- Hmm. Yeah.

124
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,202
Like I said,
predictable.

125
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:04,372
Only thing I don't get
is how is brainwashing

126
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:08,109
some guy I really like
in your plan to keep me safe?

127
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,477
His conditioning
wasn't my idea.

128
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,612
Ruvé Darhk wanted
to ensure his compliance

129
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:12,880
in the final phase.

130
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:14,782
Final phase of what?

131
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:17,318
Something called
Genesis.

132
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,588
Darhk plans to burn the world
in a nuclear fire

133
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,990
while we are protected
down here.

134
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,292
Oh, God.

135
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:28,029
Then he and his followers
can rebuild.

136
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,931
Truth be told,
it's not dissimilar

137
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,633
to the plan I had for the Glades
once upon a time,

138
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:35,036
but on a much,
much larger scale.

139
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,704
Let me guess--
you don't think

140
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:39,440
that destroying the entire world
is completely insane?

141
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,842
The world is
what's insane.

142
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:44,312
It is beyond saving.

143
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:47,882
It needs a do-over,
a reset.

144
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,952
Look. Once I realized
Darhk's plan was inevitable,

145
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,286
the math was simple.

146
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:53,588
Save yourself.

147
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,257
And my daughter...

148
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,926
Even if she doesn't
want to be saved.

149
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:02,930
Look. I am way,
way past the point of telling you

150
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:06,267
that you are crazy.

151
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,570
I just want to see Alex.

152
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,339
I just want to know
he's ok,

153
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:14,442
and look, I--I get it.

154
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,978
I'm stuck here,

155
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,981
but I can be stuck
here and compliant,

156
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:23,384
or I can be a pain
in your ass,

157
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:27,655
so take me to him now.

158
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:29,056
Heh.

159
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:41,302
Hey.

160
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:46,173
- Hey, hon.
- Hi.

161
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,309
What's up?

162
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,510
Um...

163
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,214
When I was at your
place this morning, I, um...

164
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:57,451
I found this.

165
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:01,389
Ooh. What are you doing going
through my stuff?

166
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:04,125
Snooping.

167
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,927
But--but--but this isn't any of your
business, Donna.

168
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,730
No, no, babe.
It is my business actually,

169
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,032
you getting suspended.

170
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:12,199
It is kind of.

171
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,768
- Donna.
- Hey!

172
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,403
What is this?

173
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:20,975
It's--it's, um--
it's an affidavit.

174
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,410
Pike said if I put
my name to it,

175
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:25,980
then--then I get
my badge back.

176
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:28,416
It says you didn't know that Laurel was
the Black Canary.

177
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,053
I may not be
in mansa,

178
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:34,889
but I know how
to read, sweetie.

179
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,424
I think it's
Mensa actually.

180
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:41,329
You told me that you
knew what Laurel was doing.

181
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

182
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:47,001
So this is a lie.

183
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:48,602
Yeah, but it's
a complicated lie.

184
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:51,038
- Is it?
- Yeah.

185
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,341
Yeah.

186
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,076
Because according
to Pike,

187
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:56,844
IAB are willing to
look the other way

188
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:58,566
about my working with Darhk
because I was...

189
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,650
protecting Laurel.

190
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:04,752
Why would you have to
protect her if she was a superhero?

191
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:07,188
Yeah, exactly.
Now you see.

192
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,892
I see that they're
asking you to lie.

193
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:13,494
Sweetheart, come on.

194
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:16,163
All I ever wanted
was to--was to be a cop,

195
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,566
and what's a small lie if it means I can do
some good for this city?

196
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:21,035
No. No.
That's just it.

197
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:24,205
There aren't
any small lies, hon.

198
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:25,573
Take it from someone
who had a child

199
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:29,076
with a man
who was a liar.

200
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:31,045
I'm not Noah Kuttler.

201
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,581
I know, honey,
and that's why I love you.

202
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:36,917
Ok?

203
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:39,887
I love you...

204
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:43,724
And that's why
I have faith that...

205
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:47,194
You're gonna do
the right thing.

206
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:03,444
Gentlemen, I have a little errand
I need you to run,

207
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:05,446
a loose end that
needs tying up,

208
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,181
not unlike...

209
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,582
Err.

210
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:10,985
Oh. Do I detect some
obstinacy, Mr. Brick?

211
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:14,321
I'm used to giving the orders, Darhk,
not taking them.

212
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:16,991
Not even as a little thank-you
for busting you out of Iron Heights?

213
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:18,392
Whatever happened
to gratitude?

214
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:21,095
I'm here, ain't I?

215
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:24,832
And when the whole world
is sitting under a field of mushroom clouds,

216
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:27,268
you will be glad
that you are.

217
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,504
Now then, back
to the errand.

218
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:34,475
Have either of you boys
heard of the Calculator?

219
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,984
There's no one here.

220
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,319
I found a deep-trunk
fiber optic hookup

221
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:46,554
with polymorphic
encryption.

222
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:47,655
Noah is there,
trust me.

223
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:50,291
I think she's right.
Look.

224
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:52,193
Whoever rigged that up didn't want
to be surprised.

225
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,928
I'm tracing
the Bluetooth signal.

226
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,362
Head southwest.

227
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:58,599
Well, he's not here.

228
00:09:58,601 --> 00:09:59,667
He has to be.

229
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:00,835
He was.

230
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:02,603
Looks like he bolted
and in a hurry.

231
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:03,971
Bolted from whom?

232
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:16,984
This was 20 minutes ago.

233
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:26,133
Looks like Kuttler wasn't the only one
that left Iron Heights.

234
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,397
Those are Ghosts with him.

235
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,866
What does HIVE want
with my father?

236
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:35,503
Ok. Find that
scrawny son of a bitch,

237
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:38,906
and when you do,
kill him.

238
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,877
Welcome
to Tevat Noah,

239
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,279
your home in the new era.

240
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,348
Please proceed
to the registration building

241
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,416
to receive your
residence assignments.

242
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:53,954
Aah!

243
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,058
Sorry about that.

244
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,695
It wasn't easy
finding my way down here.

245
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:04,231
You Ghosts are swell
at keeping secrets

246
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,233
but less swell
resisting torture,

247
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:08,769
so why don't you
spare me the trouble

248
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:12,239
and tell me where I can find
Damien Darhk?

249
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:16,263
<b><font color="#00FF00">♪ Arrow 4x21 ♪</font></b>

Original Air Date on May 11, 2016

251
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,264
You're right.

252
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:27,920
Kuttler's the only one
that can stop Rubicon.

253
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,522
That's why Darhk
wanted him dead.

254
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,823
You all right?

255
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,858
Yeah. The word conflicted
comes to mind.

256
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,193
Well, at least we know
he got away.

257
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,961
But not much
of a head start.

258
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,830
I hacked Kuttler's server
to see if there was

259
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,565
anything in there that could point us
to where he would run to,

260
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,766
and he cleared the cache,

261
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,334
so I can't recover
any files,

262
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,803
but there is a root directory
called Ravenspur.

263
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,004
What's Ravenspur?

264
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,372
Don't know.
Does sound familiar.

265
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,540
I just don't know why.

266
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,208
We're running
out of time.

267
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,710
The whole world is,
so yeah.

268
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,846
Meantime, my Ley line
algorithm kicked back

269
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,881
a possible twenty
on a magical clubhouse for Darhk.

270
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,955
We drove some
of them off,

271
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,690
but Reiter's sending
reinforcements.

272
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,825
Reiter's dead.

273
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,694
We heard him
on the radio.

274
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,864
He's alive.

275
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,566
There's a map of the island
in the pack.

276
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,867
Get them to the plane.

277
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,035
What about you?

278
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,169
I'm gonna find Reiter,

279
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,071
and I'm gonna end this.

280
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,372
Then I'm
staying, too.

281
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,675
Do you remember
what you told me?

282
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,144
It takes a monster
to kill a monster.

283
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,213
Now get these
people home.

284
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,424
Felicity just called.

285
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,392
She needs to see me
about something.

286
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,027
Is everything
all right?

287
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,395
I don't know.
It's Felicity,

288
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,764
so, you know,
you never know.

289
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,333
Were you signing
that thing?

290
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,001
Yeah, I was
about to.

291
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,273
Hey. Uh, before you
give me that dirty look,

292
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,775
you might want to,
uh, read this thing.

293
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,043
I already read it.

294
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,546
Just read it,
please.

295
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,516
Oh.

296
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,052
It's looks a--

297
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,254
Yeah, it's a little
different, huh?

298
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,788
"Although I was
against at first,

299
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,257
"I came to see
what Laurel was doing

300
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,827
"was vital...

301
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,797
"And important
and good

302
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,535
as the Black Canary."

303
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,637
I gave it
a little rewrite.

304
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,971
Baby.

305
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:33,811
I am so proud
of you.

306
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,813
Laurel would be, too.

307
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,815
This is me signing
my badge away.

308
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,220
No. You don't
know that.

309
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,490
All you can know
for sure

310
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,458
is that you're doing
the right thing.

311
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,098
Oh, Mr. Dennis.

312
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,968
Ms. Smoak.

313
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,672
You haven't returned
my calls.

314
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,840
Yes, I am sorry.
I've been busy.

315
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,275
So have I.

316
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,177
Running your company.

317
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,646
Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities

318
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,448
to Palmer Tech?

319
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,083
No, you don't, but you're just gonna
have to believe me

320
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,384
when I tell you that
what is on my plate right now

321
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,253
is much more important.

322
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,321
Hey!

323
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,723
Hi. Um, uh, should
I come back?

324
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,826
No, no. Please stay.

325
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:22,961
Miss Smoak, the board--

326
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,295
Can wait.

327
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:34,339
Whatever's so important,
I hope it's worth it.

328
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,678
Hi. I like your tie.
It's very--awkward.

329
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,980
Hi.

330
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,781
Thank you
for meeting me.

331
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,017
Of course,
my baby girl.

332
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,952
Oh, my God.
Ha ha ha!

333
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,921
Are you kidding?
I'm always here for you

334
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,189
as long as there's
no bees around.

335
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,523
No bees.

336
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,927
What--are you ok?

337
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,464
Does the word Ravenspur mean
anything to you?

338
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,132
If this is something
to do with your father, honey--

339
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,935
So it does. I remember the two
of you talking about it.

340
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,305
Not just talk.
It's a--it's a cabin

341
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,607
in Cypress Cove
we used to like to go to.

342
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,542
We'd, you know--we'd
nurse a bottle of wine,

343
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,211
make love
to Lionel Richie.

344
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,212
I was his penny lover.

345
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,813
You know, your father

346
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,049
could go
all night long.

347
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,550
Ok. That's enough.
I don't--

348
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,386
You know what?
Actually, I think you were conceived

349
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,920
in Ravenspur.

350
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,789
Ohh, please make
it stop, please.

351
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,491
No. Seriously, honey.
I want to be serious for a minute.

352
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,528
If this is anything remotely to do
with your father--

353
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,033
Don't worry.
I have it handled.

354
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,568
I wouldn't be
a Jewish mother

355
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,237
if I didn't worry.

356
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,571
Heh.

357
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,377
Baby, what's
that for?

358
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,579
With any luck, you'll never have
to find out.

359
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,820
There's
nothing here.

360
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,221
What, you think he was
gonna put up a sign?

361
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,589
I was thinking more
along the lines

362
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,224
of Ghosts with
automatic weapons.

363
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,427
Maybe we should
have brought our work clothes.

364
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,928
Can I talk to you
about something?

365
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,264
- Yeah.
- I spoke to Lyla.

366
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,699
She's worried
about you because

367
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,701
you said that you shot Andy
in self-defense.

368
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,069
Oliver, I don't want
to talk about this.

369
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,270
You just never said
anything about

370
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,705
self-defense
to me, John.

371
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,173
Couldn't tell Lyla
the truth and have her

372
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,541
look at me
the same way anymore.

373
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,076
Come on.
You don't know that.

374
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,343
Oliver, you're
the last person on earth

375
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,645
to lecture someone
about lying

376
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,846
to the people
they love.

377
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,915
I'm not lecturing.

378
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,084
I'm worried.

379
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,219
You're better
than me at this,

380
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,556
and you're hurting
worse than I have ever seen you.

381
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,624
Don't compound that

382
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,727
by lying
to your wife.

383
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,163
The fact that I lied
to Felicity does not

384
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,998
give me less
credibility.

385
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,767
If anything, it
should tell you

386
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,635
that I know what
I'm talking about.

387
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,441
- Yeah.
- Noah's at a cabin

388
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,743
in Cypress Cove.

389
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:52,877
We got him.

390
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,245
We're on our way.

391
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,956
You're a hard man
to find, Kuttler.

392
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,525
Come out now.
We'll make it painless.

393
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,561
Make us work for it,
we'll make it last.

394
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,866
I hate it
when they run.

395
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,073
Rahh!

396
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,975
Unh! Agh!

397
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,748
You make me chase
you anymore,

398
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,016
I'm gonna put
a bullet in you.

399
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,684
Isn't that
the plan?

400
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,292
I'm willing to give
you a sporting chance.

401
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:45,113
I heard about this game while I was
in prison, Mr. Brick.

402
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,534
You let me walk
if I take you down.

403
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,069
Darhk said you was
a smart bloke.

404
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,905
So what do you say?

405
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:57,275
It's the end of the world
as I understand it.

406
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,844
Don't just
stand there. Get in!

407
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,449
I got him.

408
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,951
Spartan, fall back!

409
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:54,371
Let's make
this simple.

410
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,505
This isn't
a reconciliation,

411
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:56,907
this isn't a reunion.

412
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:59,176
This is you helping me
save the world.

413
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,510
And what makes you
think I can?

414
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:02,646
Damien Darhk
thinks you can.

415
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:04,047
That's why he sent
last year's greatest hits

416
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,983
to take you down.

417
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:08,885
You're a smart man.
I'm assuming you know what Rubicon is.

418
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:11,521
And I'm assuming it's
under Mr. Darhk's control.

419
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:13,390
We have 12 hours
to stop it.

420
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,930
That's it?

421
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,331
You seem surprised.

422
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,735
I was expecting
a quid pro quo.

423
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:26,136
Felicity, I may be
a terrible father...

424
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,704
May?

425
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:29,673
But I'm not
a monster.

426
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,108
Terrible or not,
I am your father.

427
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,576
As long as you
live in it,

428
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:33,910
I have an interest
in seeing that

429
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:36,580
this world
doesn't end.

430
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:38,415
That said, I do
need something.

431
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:41,118
Color me shocked.

432
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,387
I can't hack Rubicon
with this setup,

433
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:45,188
not in the time
we have.

434
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,391
I'm going to need
the quantum subluminal processor

435
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:48,925
you developed
at Palmer Tech.

436
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:52,195
How did you even know
that we--

437
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:53,897
God help me if you are
using the end of days

438
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:55,599
to steal from my
company again.

439
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,034
I'm an excellent
multitasker,

440
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,136
but you can trust me
this time.

441
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:08,512
Ms. Smoak.

442
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:10,247
Oh! Mr. Dennis. Wow!

443
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:12,616
You must be very desperate for me to
talk to the board

444
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:14,518
since you brought
security to dragoon me.

445
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,420
These men are not here to take you
to the conference room.

446
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,922
They're here to escort
you out of the building.

447
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:21,191
Heh.

448
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:22,392
Excuse me?

449
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:23,727
The board has
grave concerns

450
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:25,495
about your plans to
basically give away

451
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:27,464
the biostimulant implant.

452
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:28,799
- Mmm.
- They wanted to discuss

453
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:29,966
the matter with you.

454
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:31,435
And I will talk
to them.

455
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:32,969
It's too late
for that.

456
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,771
They voted to
terminate you

457
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:37,174
effective immediately.

458
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:38,408
Wow.

459
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:41,978
Ok. Well, I just need
to grab something,

460
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,980
and I will show
myself out, thank you.

461
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:45,982
Uh, I'm sorry,
but everything in this lab

462
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,417
is proprietary.

463
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,586
We cannot allow you to leave
with company property.

464
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:51,388
Excuse me? You have
to be kidding.

465
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,923
I'm very sorry.

466
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:56,293
I had hoped that this
would end differently.

467
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:05,802
All right, folks.
You're just moving right on in here.

468
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:06,970
Have a great day.

469
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,505
Alex?

470
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:13,009
Hey, you. You ran off
like a crazy person.

471
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:15,345
Are you feeling
better?

472
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:17,314
Do you know what's
going on here?

473
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:18,782
Yeah. Ruvé told me.

474
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:20,150
Sir, we have
a situation.

475
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:21,485
Isn't it fantastic?

476
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:22,652
It is not fantastic.

477
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:24,187
It's the end
of the world.

478
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,655
No. It's just
the beginning of a new one.

479
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,724
I got into politics
to make a difference, right,

480
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:29,493
to--to make the world
a better place,

481
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:32,529
and Ruvé has shown me
that the only way to do that

482
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:35,098
is to start over.

483
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,233
Just listen to me.

484
00:21:36,235 --> 00:21:38,168
You are under
the influence

485
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,669
of some type
of drug right now,

486
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:43,774
and we need to
get out of here.

487
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:45,876
You're just gonna
have to trust me, ok?

488
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:47,778
Hey. He can trust
you later.

489
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,045
Lonnie Machin is here.

490
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:50,280
He's killed 5
of Damien's men

491
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:51,815
that we know about.

492
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:52,916
There's plenty of ways I can
respond to that,

493
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:54,251
but I'm gonna go
with good.

494
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,852
He's hitting the co2
scrubbers hours

495
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:57,254
before nuclear weapons
will render

496
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:59,222
the atmosphere above us
unbreathable.

497
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:00,924
If the ark's
life support fails,

498
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:02,426
we all suffocate.

499
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:04,060
Who's Lonnie Machin?

500
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:07,898
Heh. He's kind of
an ex-boyfriend of Thea's.

501
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:13,403
Damien told me about your special
connection to him.

502
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:16,139
I need you to help me
put him back in the box,

503
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,607
or we're all dead.

504
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:25,916
You all right?
Did you get it?

505
00:22:25,918 --> 00:22:28,552
I got fired before I could
take the processor.

506
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:29,886
I can't even show
my face in there.

507
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,121
Maybe we should call
in a bomb threat,

508
00:22:31,123 --> 00:22:32,522
just empty
the place,

509
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:34,257
or maybe plant
an actual bomb.

510
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,559
Just a small one,
one that doesn't hurt anybody,

511
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:36,726
but we have to--

512
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,094
maybe we should
just go in.

513
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:39,663
It's--ehh--too risky
to wear the gear

514
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:40,897
in the daylight.

515
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:42,199
What about the elevator
at the old lair?

516
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:43,600
Uh-uh. Mr. Dennis
shut it down

517
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:44,935
after the Larvan
attack.

518
00:22:44,937 --> 00:22:46,570
So John's right.
We'll go in

519
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,638
and help you and your
father boost it from--

520
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,574
It's in Curtis' lab.

521
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:53,777
You want me to help
my father steal from me?

522
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:56,913
Well, it's not exactly
yours anymore, is it?

523
00:22:56,915 --> 00:22:59,115
Nope. Guess not.

524
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:21,571
Door's unlocked.

525
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:23,673
Give me a count of 3
and then come on in.

526
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:24,941
Copy that.

527
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,920
I love all this
subterfuge.

528
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:38,955
Might our guardian angel
be the Green Arrow?

529
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:40,857
This was a line item
on the budget list,

530
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:42,158
and it's still
not fixed,

531
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,560
and they have the gall
to fire me.

532
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:49,733
This is fun,
working together.

533
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:51,234
Let's make this clear.

534
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:54,804
This is not a father-daughter
bonding exercise.

535
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:57,607
Felicity, we have
personnel walking the floor.

536
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:59,309
You might want to just
go on my signal.

537
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:00,777
Copy that.

538
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,178
Look. I know I've
done what appears

539
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,813
to be some
terrible things.

540
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:05,015
You tried to
steal from me.

541
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:06,850
Are we not stealing
from you now?

542
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:08,451
No. "A," it's not
my company anymore,

543
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:10,987
and "B," we're
trying to save the world.

544
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,894
Hey. Didn't I say
go on my signal?

545
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:19,429
Ok.

546
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:21,565
Now.

547
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:22,999
Ahem.

548
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,539
I'm good at solving
binary problems,

549
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,007
but matters
of the heart--

550
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,842
Are not your forte,
and stealing a processor

551
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,210
to save the end
of the world

552
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:35,812
is not the right time
for this conversation.

553
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,213
On some level,
I've always told myself

554
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:38,848
I just didn't know
how to be a father

555
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,417
or a husband.

556
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,385
And for a smart guy,
you don't seem to understand

557
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:45,055
the concept
of not the right time.

558
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:47,424
I don't know why I tried to steal
your company's tech.

559
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:49,192
Habit, I suppose,
or something deeper.

560
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:50,660
Gah! That son of a bitch!

561
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,062
I've been fired
for, like, 45 minutes,

562
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:53,797
and he's already
locked me out.

563
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,899
You have an electromagnetic
wave generator

564
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:57,701
and battery tender?

565
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,035
To force the restart.

566
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:01,805
Yes.

567
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:03,573
Yes!

568
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:12,048
Open sesame.

569
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:17,887
That's it.

570
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:19,756
Guys, I've got incoming,
northeast stairwell.

571
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:22,058
On it.

572
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,693
It's under a sublock.

573
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:40,243
It won't eject.
That never happens unless...

574
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:44,147
That. We can't leave
without the processor.

575
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:46,483
- We can if we clone it.
- Your sniffer device.

576
00:25:46,485 --> 00:25:48,985
We can copy the processor's
operating code wirelessly.

577
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:50,253
More movement.

578
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:51,921
Felicity, you must have
tripped something

579
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:53,289
because I have security
coming to the lab right now.

580
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:54,491
We're running
out of time.

581
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:56,126
The device
isn't finished.

582
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,862
- Come on.
- It's almost there.

583
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:00,997
Come on.

584
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,332
Felicity, you have to
get out of there.

585
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,700
Security's inbound.

586
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:14,444
The R&D lab is secure.

587
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:21,851
I heard you needed
a lift.

588
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,620
You're the one who
arrested me.

589
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:24,788
He's not doing
that now.

590
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,989
You get it?

591
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:27,223
No.

592
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:36,023
How bad is it?

593
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:38,192
Kuttler was able to clone
90% of the processor.

594
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:40,227
He may be able to extrapolate
the remaining 10%

595
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:41,662
to build us
a workable processor.

596
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:43,431
I'm gathering parts
for him to work with,

597
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,032
but we're still gonna need to upload
the override codes

598
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,534
to every nuke silo
individually.

599
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:47,668
Can you do that?

600
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,303
Only from
a server farm.

601
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,809
Mr. Queen!

602
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:00,848
My men are searching
the woods for my property,

603
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,652
but you chose not
to die with them.

604
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:07,922
I killed a few
of the stragglers.

605
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:12,426
My power has grown
beyond your imagining.

606
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:13,894
Let me show you.

607
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:34,782
Ohh!

608
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:40,054
Valiant effort,
Mr. Queen,

609
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:41,922
but still only mortal.

610
00:27:48,764 --> 00:27:50,631
The primary
scrubber's in here.

611
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,266
I'm betting
Machin is, too.

612
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:54,201
Well, don't I get
something to fight him with?

613
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:55,269
I don't think I can
trust you with a weapon

614
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:56,437
for some reason.

615
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,738
You're just gonna
have to make do

616
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,240
with Krav Maga,
I'm afraid.

617
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:11,752
Oh, the irony.

618
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:14,054
All Darhk's parasites
living underground,

619
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:16,457
breathing the waste product
of sludge.

620
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,330
What happens if I
turn this dial?

621
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:27,067
Well, if you're not
gonna tell me,

622
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:28,435
I'm just gonna have to see
for myself.

623
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:29,803
Step away
from that.

624
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:31,138
Run along, little girl.

625
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,473
I'm a tad busy
at the moment

626
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:33,774
trying to kill
everyone here.

627
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:36,010
I'm not a little girl,
Lonnie.

628
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:38,445
Remember me?

629
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:41,348
My name is Thea Queen.

630
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,817
I'm the one that
gave you that face.

631
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:49,957
Mommy. Ha

632
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,159
I didn't recognize you
without the red leather.

633
00:28:52,161 --> 00:28:54,461
Whatever are you
doing here?

634
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:56,630
Look. I get it.
You're mad at Darhk

635
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,465
because he screwed
you over,

636
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:01,368
and now you're
trying to get payback.

637
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,937
I'm not gonna stop
you, ok?

638
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,307
If anything,
I'm gonna help you,

639
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,975
but there are innocent
people here,

640
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:09,510
people that have
been brainwashed,

641
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:12,146
and they don't
deserve to die.

642
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:18,485
Lonnie, don't do this.

643
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,988
I will help you
take down Darhk, ok?

644
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,223
We can do this together.

645
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,391
You just need to get
out of here.

646
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:35,903
What the hell did you
do that for?

647
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:37,037
I had him.

648
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,606
No, you didn't.

649
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:40,341
Explosive charges.

650
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,675
He was gonna blow
the scrubber

651
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:43,043
no matter
what you said.

652
00:29:44,513 --> 00:29:45,613
Can you disarm it?

653
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:47,247
We'll soon find out.

654
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,386
Clear!

655
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:54,355
I'm gonna need
the subnode taken offline.

656
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:55,723
Ok. I can do that.

657
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:57,024
I'll cover him.

658
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:58,926
I'll take care of him.

659
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:00,494
Get to work.

660
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:05,499
Nice to meet you.

661
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:08,736
My daughter certainly
has some very impressive friends.

662
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:10,738
How long is this
gonna take?

663
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,675
Ideally, less than it takes Mr. Darhk
to nuke the world.

664
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:16,944
I'm not the man
my daughter thinks, you know?

665
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:19,046
Don't tell me.
Tell her.

666
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:20,914
I've tried.

667
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:23,050
I tried explaining
that there are two sides to me,

668
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:26,020
the father
and the hacker.

669
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:28,522
She sees only
the criminal.

670
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:31,025
I mention this because you strike
me as someone

671
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:34,528
with experience
leading a dual life.

672
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,296
Any insights
you'd care to share?

673
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:40,200
Yeah. It doesn't work.

674
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:42,269
You leading a dual life
is why you lost her.

675
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:45,272
You sound like you're
talking from some personal experience.

676
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:47,608
What's that?

677
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,109
Felicity's taken
the subnode offline,

678
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:50,744
and we've developed
a new problem.

679
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:52,780
- What?
- Tapeworm in the Rubicon code,

680
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,715
antihack failsafe
courtesy

681
00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:56,283
of your friends
in HIVE.

682
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:58,419
- Can you override it?
- I just did

683
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,054
but not before
the tapeworm transmitted

684
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:01,955
this terminal's
location.

685
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:03,290
Figure we have
about 90 seconds.

686
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,059
- Until what?
- Till HIVE rains all manner

687
00:31:05,061 --> 00:31:07,261
of hell
down on us.

688
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:17,359
What happened?

689
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:19,261
HIVE has
our position.

690
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:20,496
We have maybe a minute
before they arrive.

691
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,497
They're working
on shutting me down,

692
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:22,998
but I know
a few tricks.

693
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,500
This will go twice as fast
with the two of us.

694
00:31:24,502 --> 00:31:25,835
We'll hold them off
as long as we can.

695
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:27,870
Establish a perimeter.

696
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:29,805
Shoot to kill.

697
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:32,074
I don't need to tell you
what's riding on this.

698
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,512
POTUS and SECDEF have
taken us to DEFCON-2.

699
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:37,847
Just two?
They're optimistic.

700
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:39,315
They don't want to
cause a panic.

701
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:40,816
The president asked me
if the fate of the world

702
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:42,318
is resting the hands
of an IT girl,

703
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,520
a criminal, and two guys
in Halloween costumes.

704
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,388
They're not
Halloween costumes.

705
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,309
Get the idol!

706
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:19,088
We got to go!

707
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,489
What about Reiter?

708
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,424
He can't do anything
without the idol.

709
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:29,365
Come on!

710
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,204
If this is the end
of the world,

711
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:36,705
I don't mind
going out like this.

712
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,440
Don't you ever stop?

713
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:40,442
Not when it comes
to my daughter, no.

714
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:46,115
Alex? Everything's fine.

715
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:47,583
We took out all
the explosives.

716
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:50,419
Al--Alex?

717
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:52,888
Alex, oh, God.
Oh, God. Are you--

718
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,560
Fine? Ok?
Hunk dory?

719
00:32:59,297 --> 00:33:01,497
Believe me,
there is nothing

720
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:03,632
hunky dory
about screwing up someone's

721
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:05,768
plan for vengeance
a second time,

722
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,104
which means I've got to wait for
Mr. Darhk to arrive

723
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:10,940
and go
with plan "B."

724
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:16,078
It's left me with some time to
kill, so to speak.

725
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,813
Ok. Alex, come one.

726
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:19,481
Relax. He's fine.

727
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:22,785
Just taking
a little nap.

728
00:33:25,957 --> 00:33:28,290
What is it
with you?

729
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,592
Why are you always
at the mercy

730
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:32,661
of some guy?

731
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:34,697
You can make your
own decisions, Thea.

732
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,398
You're not a pawn.

733
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:39,602
You're a Queen.

734
00:33:41,873 --> 00:33:43,939
Get it?

735
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,642
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

736
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:52,248
Here they come.

737
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,451
That's a lot
of firepower.

738
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:57,152
We don't need
to beat them.

739
00:33:57,154 --> 00:33:58,888
We just need to buy
Felicity and her father enough time.

740
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:37,626
Thea?

741
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:39,161
Alex, get out
of here!

742
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,534
Get away from him!

743
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:48,470
I'm liberating
you, mommy!

744
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:50,773
You don't need another man
clouding your mind.

745
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:52,474
Alex, run!

746
00:34:53,744 --> 00:34:55,377
No!

747
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,326
Alex!

748
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:22,705
I'm sorry.

749
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:14,289
I think I got
an algorithm down to 300 lines

750
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,758
for the uplink.

751
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,192
Have you tried to
break the JSI encryption ?

752
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:19,261
That way, you can
directly bypass the PAL.

753
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,596
Yeah, you're right.

754
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:36,111
3 minutes till Rubicon
launches the nukes.

755
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:38,781
Overwatch,
Amar is headed inside.

756
00:36:40,317 --> 00:36:41,984
We're running
out of time.

757
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,130
- Are you hit?
- No!

758
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,033
No, no, no, no.

759
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:59,268
Oh, no.

760
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,502
What's happening?

761
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:01,837
We got every nuke

762
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,138
except one.

763
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:06,986
_

764
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,088
_

765
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:18,454
We lost one.
It's in the air.

766
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:20,322
Headed straight
for Monument Point.

767
00:37:26,987 --> 00:37:29,606
The bullet went through,
but I need you to hold still.

768
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:31,174
I think we have
more important concerns,

769
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:32,574
such as preventing
another launch.

770
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:34,375
I thought you two
stopped Rubicon.

771
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,810
Rubicon knows the missiles
didn't launch.

772
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:37,311
It keeps trying to
send launch codes.

773
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:38,679
Which we have to
override manually one by one.

774
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:40,181
It's kind of like
whack-a-mole.

775
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,582
Except we don't get
a stuffed animal if we win.

776
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:43,150
Is it true?

777
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:44,351
There's one
in the air?

778
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:45,986
Headed straight
for Monument Point.

779
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:47,354
- Can you override?
- That is what I'm trying to do

780
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,191
while Noah keeps
the missiles in their silos.

781
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:52,159
We need to start
evacuations.

782
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:54,195
There's not enough time
to get everyone out.

783
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:58,098
This is Argus director
Lyla Michaels.

784
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,534
I'm reporting
an Endtime event.

785
00:38:00,536 --> 00:38:02,536
Target is Monument Point.

786
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,574
Felicity.

787
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,275
I'm trying to hack
their navigation systems.

788
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,710
What's that?

789
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:11,111
Another hit in the Ley line
algorithm I set up.

790
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:13,214
I cross-referenced it
with news reports and--

791
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:14,615
the mayor's office
just evacuated city hall

792
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:16,016
due to a gas leak.

793
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:17,418
Like you said, why
would Darhk's wife run

794
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,688
for mayor of a city
he wants to destroy?

795
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,257
To gain access
to city hall

796
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,292
for this exact moment.

797
00:38:25,294 --> 00:38:27,361
The Nexus chamber must
be beneath that building.

798
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:28,796
If he's hiding where
he should be hiding

799
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:30,097
to absorb the power
of a nuke attack.

800
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,899
Let's go.

801
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:33,868
You need to divert
that missile.

802
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,603
You are lucky I'm too busy to come up
with a witty response

803
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,971
to that right now.

804
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,150
Stop. Stop!
Unh!

805
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:53,287
Taiana, are you ok?
Are you hurt?

806
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,855
Something's...

807
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:06,967
Got it!
Mostly.

808
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,402
- What?
- Sent the remaining

809
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:10,204
launch algorithms
into an infinite loop.

810
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:13,007
Should buy the world 24 hours,
give or take.

811
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:14,742
What about the nuke
headed to Monument Point?

812
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:16,577
It's stubborn.
There's a reason why these things

813
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,413
were designed to be
impossible to move off course,

814
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:22,550
which is why I have to move
Monument Point instead.

815
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:23,617
GPS realignment.

816
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,085
What do you mean?

817
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:26,787
As a prank, I once
relocated a GPS satellite.

818
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:28,422
Everyone on
the eastern seaboard

819
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:31,125
thought they were 20 miles west of
their actual location.

820
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:33,694
Do that to the missile, you
avoid a direct hit.

821
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,936
That's it.

822
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,822
Direct hit
on Havenrock.

823
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,060
Maximum yield.

824
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:09,163
How many casualties?

825
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:10,831
Tens of thousands.

826
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:17,638
Monument Point would
have been a couple million, Felicity.

827
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:34,555
Damn it. We searched
everywhere.

828
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:22,436
Hello, Oliver. Nice timing.

829
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,739
I think you're gonna need
much bigger arrows.

831
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:55,354
Greg!
Move your head.
