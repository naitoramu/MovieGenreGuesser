1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,701
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,286
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,748
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,424
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment</i>

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,424
<i>and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son.</i>

6
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,597
<i>So I asked the best man I know
to help.</i>

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,218
<i>His name is John Diggle.</i>

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,097
<i>And he is the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,223
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,556
Could you tutor me some more
before the test?

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,892
- See you soon.
- She's pretty cool.

12
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,320
His life will be better
with you in it. Just like mine.

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,611
Cayden James is the most skilled
hacker the world has ever known.

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,488
Eight months ago he was scooped up
by A.R.G.U.S.,

15
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,820
and now he's being held
without cause,

16
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,371
being tortured, who knows what else.

17
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,039
Helix is about to
extract Cayden James.

18
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,115
- One...
- Two...

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,200
Three.

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,082
And Laurel,

21
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,040
<i>she wasn't dead when we found her
back on Lian Yu.</i>

22
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,453
Buy you a drink?

23
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,206
Whiskey. Neat.

24
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,876
Are you waiting for someone?

25
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,295
Is it too cheesy if I say "you"?

26
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,336
I'll let it slide this time.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,421
And what about you?

28
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,925
Let me guess.
You're a numbers guy.

29
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,131
You sit in front of
a computer all day

30
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,261
and you came here
to blow off some steam.

31
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,013
You've got me pegged.

32
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,429
I think the bartender
forgot your order.

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,354
I have a better idea.

34
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,744
Uh-oh.

35
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,656
Looks like I know
your dirty little secret.

36
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,786
Oh, it's...

37
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,252
I won't tell if you won't tell.

38
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,254
All right.

39
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,834
You know my secret. Now...

40
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,758
Tell me one of yours.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,681
Okay.

42
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,511
Only if you promise
not to tell anyone.

43
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,268
Cross my heart and hope to die.

44
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,057
Mmm...

45
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,116
William did an excellent job
picking out your tie.

46
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,200
Yeah. He was very excited.
He wanted to come to dinner.

47
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,289
I told him that Raisa was
his date tonight.

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,996
Oh. Well, she's a lucky woman.

49
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,373
Has it, um...

50
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,670
Has it been three years
since the first time we did this?

51
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,722
Yeah, let's just hope that
this date goes better than that one.

52
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,094
I think it will.

53
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,474
Don't jinx it.

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,803
Masked gunmen could
come through the door,

55
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,604
and it would've been better
than our first dinner.

56
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,857
Well, only because
we were not being blown up.

57
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,527
You know,
also because I wasn't ready.

58
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,108
Not the way I am now.

59
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,359
Well, now the time is right.

60
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,318
<i>- Mr. Mayor?</i>
- Yes?

61
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,279
I'm sorry to interrupt.

62
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,032
I just wanted to say that I'm voting

63
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,460
against that awful
anti-vigilante referendum.

64
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,878
Oh, that's very nice to hear.

65
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,707
Are you two back together?

66
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,337
Such a sweet couple.

67
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,508
- Well, enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

68
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,173
Don't forget to vote, okay?

69
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,969
You paid her to say that?

70
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,438
I had absolutely nothing
to do with that.

71
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,765
Hmm.

72
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,022
Well, I am
the mayor's girlfriend now,

73
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,822
so does that get me
a break on my taxes

74
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,990
or maybe a pass on jury duty?

75
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,536
I mean, I was gonna offer
to bring you to a fundraiser.

76
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,487
Hmm...

77
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,164
I can not tell you what it is

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,661
if you're gonna
keep making that face.

79
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,244
No. Sorry. It's just, you know...

80
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,550
With Overwatch and the
start-up with Curtis, and, you know...

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,339
It's our old, but new, relationship.

82
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,889
Maybe we could

83
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,969
ease in to some of the things.

84
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,061
Of course, of course.

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,523
I love rolling to those things solo.

86
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,562
Yeah, you're lying.

87
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,642
I'm kidding.

88
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,109
I'm really happy that you're busy,

89
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,317
and I'm especially excited
for this thing with Curtis,

90
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,322
because, truth be told,

91
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,576
it is important you have something
in your life that is not just...

92
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,826
The team.

93
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:52,998
Yes.

94
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,790
No, I mean... The team.

95
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,459
This is how it felt to be you,
isn't it?

96
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,964
Oh, yeah.

97
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,250
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:04,919
Go.

99
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,182
What's going on?

100
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,765
Body dropped outside of a bar.
Dinah's on the scene with SCPD.

101
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,939
<i>The vic was dead on arrival.</i>

102
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,323
Paramedics are calling it
internal hemorrhaging,

103
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,776
but I'd recognize this kill
from a mile away.

104
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,862
Sonic Scream did this.
An inch from his ear.

105
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,868
- Ouch.
- Laurel.

106
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,371
Witnesses saw the vic leaving
with a woman, a brunette.

107
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,285
Maybe Laurel got a wig?

108
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,415
According to witnesses,

109
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,292
they were very handsy with each other
on the way out.

110
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,045
What do you guys think?
Black Siren turned Black Widow?

111
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,301
You know, 'cause she mates
and then kills?

112
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,088
Dinah, thanks.
We'll take it from here.

113
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,969
Victim was an accountant
named Jackson Klimavich.

114
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:58,390
No criminal record, boring job,
really boring Upswipz profile.

115
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,021
Well, he was married,
so maybe not so boring.

116
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,601
Boring and scummy.

117
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,814
Sorry. Had to help Lance finish up
the polling analysis.

118
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,072
Star City stands at 70% against
the anti-vigilante legislation.

119
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,030
That's 70% for us accounting for
the double negative you just used.

120
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,161
Yeah, but after everything
this team has done for the city...

121
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,708
You'd think it'd be higher.

122
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,160
What'd I miss?

123
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,587
Evil Laurel seduced a guy
and then killed him.

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,298
- Why?
- That's what we have to figure out.

125
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,546
First, we've got to find her.
Laurel's been in the wind too long.

126
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,172
Yeah, we're on it.

127
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,712
Speaking of being on it,

128
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,513
did you mail out
our articles of incorporation?

129
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,224
For our start-up? The documents
required to, you know, start it up?

130
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,102
Oh, my God. They are in
a manila envelope on my countertop,

131
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,227
with every intention of mailing them.

132
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,731
I was just telling Oliver
how I'm being stretched too thin.

133
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,152
Wait a minute,
What do you mean by "just"?

134
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,604
We were at dinner
when I got your text.

135
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,984
Felicity...

136
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,360
No, it's the job. It's okay.

137
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,862
No, this is all on me.

138
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,568
I 911'd you over one dead body.

139
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,904
- Can you make it back for dessert?
- Well, no.

140
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,330
- We have to find Evil Laurel.
- No, no, no.

141
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,657
I will find Evil Laurel.

142
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,617
You go out there and take your
ass back and get your man.

143
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,373
- Are you sure?
- Are you kidding me?

144
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,544
I was your guys' biggest shipper.

145
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,668
I feel like the reconciliation
taking effect is kind of on me.

146
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,216
- No. You're amazing.
- I'm "terrific."

147
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,343
- Well...
- Is that getting old?

148
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,419
- I kinda like it.
- You like?

149
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,095
- Yeah. Anyways...
- Cool. All right. Go, go.

150
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,031
Finally. I thought you were gonna
keep me waiting here all night.

151
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,027
Patience is how
wars are won, Ms. Lance.

152
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,070
Well, the first battle's
already over.

153
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,830
Look, I don't know if this is
your first clandestine meeting,

154
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,037
but at this point,
most people would say "thank you."

155
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,163
For the item?

156
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,792
Or for leaving a body
for the police to find?

157
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,797
Better than a witness to question.

158
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,311
Any reservations?
Concerns about what comes next?

159
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,895
Of course not.

160
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,644
This one shouldn't be a problem.

161
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,733
Glad to hear it.

162
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,823
Until we meet again.

163
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,041
I'm so sorry
that I had to bail on dinner,

164
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:28,749
but I'm home now, if you want to
come by for some dessert.

165
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,380
Yes. Yes, that was
intentionally suggestive.

166
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,258
Okay, well, good. I'll see you soon.

167
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,434
Nice try, but I wasn't born...

168
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,015
Alena?

169
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,645
Do you always
announce your attacks like that?

170
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,272
What're you doing in my apartment?

171
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,274
You'd think a computer hacker
would know better

172
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,105
than to install a smart-lock
on her door.

173
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,316
I mean, what are you doing here?

174
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,068
I need your help.

175
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,575
You-you? Or Helix-you?

176
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,654
Does it matter?

177
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,206
Let's pretend for a second it does.

178
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,952
Who gave you that?

179
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,088
Cayden James.

180
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,337
He's working on something terrible,

181
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,135
something that will
hurt the entire world.

182
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,597
And I need your help to stop him.

183
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,643
I helped you break Cayden James
out of A.R.G.U.S. custody.

184
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,066
I went against my friends.
I went against my team,

185
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,816
because you told me
that Cayden James was a good man.

186
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,569
No, you did it because Cayden could
help you find Adrian Chase.

187
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,648
And he delivered.

188
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,030
So, at what point did he become
a criminal mastermind?

189
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,236
I don't know, at some point during

190
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,447
his eight months
in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

191
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,866
They held him in a glorified
shipping container, Felicity.

192
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,123
Nutrition-withholding,
sensory deprivation.

193
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,001
They broke him.

194
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,923
In that case, he should be
in a funny farm somewhere.

195
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,591
He shouldn't be
planning the end of the world.

196
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,886
Actually, how do I know that you
being here isn't part of his plan?

197
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,213
Because I could never go along with

198
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,843
what I suspect
he's planning, Felicity.

199
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,472
I'm a hacktivist, not a monster.

200
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,180
You say he has plans
to hurt the world?

201
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,141
How?

202
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,943
I don't know exactly
what he's planning.

203
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,736
But I saw a casualty estimate,

204
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,691
and the most conservative estimate
is 4% collateral damage.

205
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,366
4% of what?

206
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,781
The world population.

207
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,080
That's almost 300 million people.

208
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,162
If we try and hack his servers,

209
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,664
we might be able to figure out
what he's planning.

210
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,957
- Okay, where is he now?
- Corto Maltese.

211
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,418
But I came here because I didn't know
who else to reach out to.

212
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,465
Will you help me?

213
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,936
We set Cayden James loose, Alena.
Of course I'm helping.

214
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,566
Looks like the same M.O.

215
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,490
Did Laurel also make out
with this one first?

216
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,118
It's a legitimate
investigatory question.

217
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,366
Cause of death is the same.
This was definitely Laurel.

218
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,788
Yeah, victimology was similar, too,

219
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,492
insofar as this woman is
just as boring as the first guy.

220
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,543
College librarian.
May even be more boring.

221
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,915
Maybe Laurel's killing for sport.

222
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,167
Doesn't sound like her.

223
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,958
Black Siren isn't the Laurel
you remember, remember?

224
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,634
Any word on tracking her down?

225
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,713
Nothing usable from the CCTV cams
we found on either crime scene.

226
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,553
- Forensics is a dead end as well.
- And Felicity?

227
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,178
I tried texting her,
but she hasn't hit me back.

228
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,555
Fine. Let's hit the streets.

229
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,352
Someone has to be able to
help us find Laurel.

230
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,764
What about me? Uh...

231
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,475
I want to hit streets, too,
and maybe a couple of bad guys.

232
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,652
Curtis, with Felicity AWOL,
we need tech.

233
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,819
Keep working that angle.

234
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,072
But I've been
working that angle.

235
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,288
- Another dead end.
- Did you try spoofing the sub-array?

236
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,740
- Yeah.
- What about the...

237
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,496
Yeah, but these firewalls
are crafty.

238
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,293
I mean, the protection protocols
are just...

239
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,086
- Art.
- I was going to say "impenetrable."

240
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,459
But, yeah, that too.

241
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,170
Cayden would be the only one
who can get into Cayden's system.

242
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,044
Oh, my God, you're a genius.

243
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,630
You're a genius.

244
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,095
We need to convince Cayden's system
that we're him.

245
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,060
That's like saying,
"All we need is a trillion dollars."

246
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,603
No, we have to work off
Cayden's system.

247
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,102
- I told you. He's in Corto Maltese.
- Yeah, but Helix is right here.

248
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,229
We cleared the place out, Felicity.
It's sanitized.

249
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,026
What about the wiring?
The digital infrastructure?

250
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,193
That's proprietary.

251
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,572
Cayden's own design.
We left that in place.

252
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,194
That'll work. Let's get the gear.

253
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,367
Does that include a ghost drive?

254
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,410
Because we're gonna need that
to get into Cayden's system.

255
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,704
I know a guy.

256
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,702
Whoa. What's all this?

257
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,375
Um, just some stuff for a start-up that
Curtis and I are trying to start up.

258
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,497
Oh, good for you.

259
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,829
- You guys are funded?
- Well, seed money

260
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,710
from our reputation of being
the geniuses of Palmer Tech.

261
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,917
Though I'd feel more like a genius
if I knew what we were starting up.

262
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,627
We're thinking something
in the smart-home area.

263
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,711
You're joking.

264
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,843
You left Helix...

265
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,595
I was kicked out of Helix. By you.

266
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,766
To make home appliances?

267
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,138
I thought you wanted
to change the world.

268
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,345
I thought you wanted to
change the world,

269
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,770
and look where you ended up.

270
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,057
- Sorry, that's... I didn't...
- No.

271
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,521
- We should go.
- We should go.

272
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,362
- Okay. We good?
- Mmm-hmm.

273
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:05,983
Oliver.

274
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,657
Hey. Hi. What are you doing here?

275
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,405
You invited me.

276
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,448
That's right.

277
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,703
What is she doing here?

278
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,747
Hi.

279
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,454
I'm just gonna go over there.

280
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,915
Okay, come in.

281
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,677
I know how much you love to say
"I told you so."

282
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,843
No, that's you.

283
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,466
So consider this
an early Christmas gift.

284
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,095
Cayden James is a bad person, and
he's planning on doing a bad thing.

285
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,643
Are you sure that you can trust her?

286
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,014
I wouldn't exactly
use the word "trust."

287
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,144
Then wherever you're going,
I'm going, too.

288
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,896
No. This isn't your life anymore. No.

289
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,903
At least tell the team
what you're doing.

290
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,609
I will tell them.
I'll call them on my way.

291
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,990
And then, when I'm done,
we can finish dinner.

292
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,616
Starting with dessert. Alena.

293
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,997
<i>Mmm.</i>

294
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,502
I didn't know
you guys were back together.

295
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,578
We sure are.

296
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,552
Excuse me.

297
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,393
- Here you go.
- Oh. Thanks.

298
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,690
I'm such a klutz.

299
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,355
Don't worry, me too.

300
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,609
I love your shoes. They're so cute.

301
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,068
Custom designed.

302
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,030
Girls can rock limited-edition kicks,
too, right?

303
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,746
Absolutely.

304
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,874
I'm Dinah, by the way.

305
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,202
Jenny.

306
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,086
It's really nice to meet you.

307
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,800
I don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

308
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,718
Laurel's cry resonates
in the terahertz range,

309
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,762
which can be triangulated,
according to geography.

310
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,970
Was I supposed to understand
a single word of that,

311
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,346
or were you talking to yourself?

312
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,562
Sorry.
The short version is

313
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,140
I think I've figured out a way
to find Evil Laurel

314
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,520
by tracking her sonic cry.

315
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,192
Meaning if she uses it,
we can find her.

316
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,811
Yeah. Only problem being it means

317
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,362
someone's probably in trouble...

318
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,901
Whoa!

319
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,737
Talk about timing.

320
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,989
Yes, so that means
she just used it, right?

321
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,695
- Mmm-hmm.
- Where?

322
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,160
A parking garage
between Marleau and Hainesly.

323
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,492
- I'll tell John and Rene.
- Mmm-hmm.

324
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,506
Nothing on Level C.

325
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,504
<i>- D is clear.
- A is empty.</i>

326
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,756
<i>Except for a sweet-ass Corvette
someone left overnight.</i>

327
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,170
Guys.

328
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,016
- We're too late.
- Actually, you're right on time.

329
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,610
My mistake for dawdling, I guess.

330
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,029
It's just...

331
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,607
It's just she was so, so pretty.

332
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,245
<i>I really wanted to hold her hand
until the end came.</i>

333
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,160
You are one twisted bitch.

334
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,667
That really hurts my feelings.

335
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,217
- She's gone.
- Good work tracking her down.

336
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,344
- Don't give me points for being late.
- Call it in.

337
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,580
Okay. You couldn't have
told me to change?

338
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,997
You look great.

339
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,493
Are we here for a GMD
or an acid-trip techno freak-show?

340
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,873
<i>Both, if you want.</i>

341
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,004
Okay, so the dealer's name
is Amnesiac.

342
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,377
But I have no idea how to find him.

343
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,791
Well...

344
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,548
Whoa! Okay!

345
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,628
Rude.

346
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,089
Maybe that door guarded by the three
scary dudes with chains for brains?

347
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,173
Eh.

348
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,552
They look friendly.

349
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,187
Hello.

350
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,562
You lost?

351
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,694
No. We're here to see...

352
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,901
- Amnesiac.
- Hmm, yup.

353
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,573
Now.

354
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,461
- Okay, that time...
- I don't think we should go in here.

355
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,620
- Hey!
- Hands off!

356
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,330
Hey, easy, chrome dome!

357
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,626
<i>Forgive my thuggish compatriots.</i>

358
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,761
I pay them
to uphold a certain aesthetic.

359
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,137
You're Amnesiac?

360
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,720
Your shock is exactly what
this establishment aims to cultivate.

361
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,149
Now, what brings you here?

362
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,976
We need a ghost mirror drive.

363
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,319
- What for?
- That's our business.

364
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,113
<i>And selling
illegal tech is mine.</i>

365
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,613
And I only get to stay in business
by avoiding legal entanglements.

366
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,486
Everything about you two
screams narc.

367
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,904
Well...

368
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,392
Whoa, whoa! No!
Don't shoot! It's me!

369
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,802
Oliver?

370
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,646
- Are you okay?
- No!

371
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,690
What the hell are you doing here?

372
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,189
Trying to keep you safe.
I saw the guys take you.

373
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,737
Yeah. Those guys were taking me
to this guy,

374
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,780
who's gonna give us what we needed
to stop Cayden James.

375
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,984
But now he won't because
you kicked the crap out of him.

376
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,119
God.

377
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,122
You screwed up everything.

378
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,209
He said he thought you were police.

379
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,211
You know,
me not wanting your help tonight

380
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,509
doesn't have to do with me
just needing to do this alone.

381
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,177
It has to do with me
wanting to protect you.

382
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,505
I was trying to protect you.

383
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,057
You are under 24/7 surveillance
from the FBI right now.

384
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,260
- What if somebody saw you?
- I can handle it.

385
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,182
What I cannot handle
and will not stand for

386
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,810
is you going off after a criminal
without backup.

387
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,859
I get that.
But I don't need that right now.

388
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,727
What I need...

389
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,774
What I need is a ghost mirror drive.

390
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,234
And I need to get Alena out of here
before they all come to.

391
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,445
- Felicity...
- We will talk about this later.

392
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,957
Another boring person.

393
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,125
Disrespect the dead much?

394
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,661
He's right.

395
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,538
No connections, no money to speak of,

396
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,170
no apparent benefit to killing
three different people at random.

397
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,667
They weren't random.

398
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,753
Autopsies finally came back
on all three victims.

399
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,712
Apart from all three being
thoroughly unremarkable,

400
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,218
they had one other thing in common.

401
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,425
All three had traces of Dimotex 75
on their hands.

402
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,976
Dimotex is an adhesive polymer.

403
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,099
It's used on the streets
to rip off fingerprints.

404
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,850
Laurel was stealing fingerprints.

405
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,734
Why would somebody wanna collect
the fingerprints of three nobodies?

406
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,519
And I disrespect the dead?

407
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:00,940
They're not nobodies.

408
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,612
They're invisible.

409
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,535
<i>Boring jobs,
no connection to community.</i>

410
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,954
What makes them remarkable
is just how unremarkable they are.

411
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,747
What're you saying, hoss?
I mean, boss.

412
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,628
What if these peoples' backgrounds
are just a cover?

413
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,299
They're boring by design.
To be invisible.

414
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,251
So you're saying they're all
some sort of covert operatives?

415
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,381
They could be anything.

416
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,587
But whatever they're dealing with,

417
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,889
it's big enough
that they needed a cover.

418
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,056
Be nice to know.

419
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,809
That way, we could figure out
who Laurel's going after next.

420
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,056
Anybody got a crystal ball?

421
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,390
I might not be able to figure out
where she's headed,

422
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,233
but I might be able to figure out
where she was.

423
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,402
Now, sonic cries
leave ripples in the air.

424
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,445
I might be able to backtrace
where Laurel's been

425
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,898
and maybe even find out a pattern.

426
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,733
Maybe even determine
where she's operating out of.

427
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,194
I heard two "mights"
and two "maybes," but I'll take it.

428
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,447
In the meantime,
I'll try to raise Felicity.

429
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,076
If anyone can
hack through these covers

430
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,284
to these people's real identities,
it's her.

431
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,210
Wow, love what you haven't done
with the place.

432
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,133
Cat-5 hookups are there
and back there.

433
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,209
Yeah.

434
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,258
One sec.
Hey, John.

435
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,883
Hey. Did you decide
to take a vacation?

436
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,220
Uh, no, sorry.
I just have a situation here.

437
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,054
Yeah, Curtis told me
about the start-up.

438
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,387
No. This isn't about the company.
This is about Cayden James.

439
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,222
And I don't have time
to talk to you about it right now,

440
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,399
but you were right and I was wrong
about breaking him out of A.R.G.U.S.

441
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,226
- Felicity, listen...
- I'm at Helix right now.

442
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,686
I'm just gonna clear up
this situation real quick.

443
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,988
I will be back to the bunker
before you know it. I promise.

444
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,065
All right. But get back here soon.
We need you.

445
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,149
I'm on it.

446
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:28,902
Got it!

447
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,904
The "mights" and "maybes"
have paid off.

448
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,083
Backtracing Laurel's soundwaves

449
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,582
produced a probabilistic curve
of geolocations,

450
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,414
which I canvassed
by means of cameras of various sorts.

451
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,256
Curtis, less how, more what.

452
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,924
I've got a probable location
for Laurel's base of operation.

453
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,054
Tasking a keyhole satellite.

454
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,758
When was this?

455
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,343
Ten seconds ago.

456
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,262
Anybody know that guy?

457
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,475
How about that one?

458
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,151
- Never seen him before.
- I have.

459
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,271
We should go. Felicity's in trouble.

460
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,483
A file in here
is labeled "Arclight."

461
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,534
Must be a code name
for whatever James is planning.

462
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,663
Now the question is,
what is the plan?

463
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,716
You're supposed to be
in Corto Maltese.

464
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,920
- This is Cayden James?
<i>- No, Ms. Smoak.</i>

465
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,767
I'm Cayden James.

466
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,556
Very nice to finally
make your acquaintance.

467
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,902
In case you're curious
about why I'm here,

468
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,570
it's not nostalgia.

469
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,491
It's you.

470
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,203
We never finished our conversation
in Corto Maltese.

471
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,660
<i>Which is where you thought I was.</i>

472
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,291
Because you've been pinging my cell.

473
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,829
I was hurt. Truly.

474
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,295
Not by the betrayal
so much as the naiveté

475
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,506
of someone I thought had potential.

476
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,797
Sorry, Ms. Smoak.

477
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm afraid you're what's known
as collateral damage.

478
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,722
Horrible waste of talent.

479
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,939
Make it as humane as possible.

480
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,896
One shot.

481
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,355
You won't even know.

482
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,400
Get down!

483
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,579
How'd you guys know we needed you?
Not that I'm complaining.

484
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,663
Felicity.

485
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,047
Alena. Alena!

486
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,218
Call an ambulance.

487
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,966
<i>Stay with me.</i>

488
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,840
Stay with me. Alena.

489
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,137
It's bad. It's really bad.

490
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,474
Alena?

491
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,392
How is she?

492
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,189
Stabilized.

493
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,734
The next couple of hours
will tell her story.

494
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,900
I air-gapped her ICU room
just in case if Cayden tried

495
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,236
to kill her by hacking
her hospital equipment. He can't.

496
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,867
- Hey. You all right?
- Am I all right?

497
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,832
That I broke a genius madman
out of prison,

498
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,251
who's apparently working with
the psychopath version of Laurel?

499
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,171
Am I okay that I didn't see
what was right in front of my face

500
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,589
and now Alena might die?

501
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,916
What the hell do you think?

502
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,043
Sorry.

503
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,554
- It's not you I'm mad at.
- I know that.

504
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,924
But right now we need you.

505
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,134
Yeah, I know. Curtis?

506
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,388
All set. Did everything
just like you told me.

507
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,145
I softened the beach so now
you can, you know, do your thing.

508
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,942
Well, I couldn't do that before
because of Cayden.

509
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,855
All right. I'm in.

510
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:36,733
John was right.

511
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,865
They're hiding their identities
because they are really important.

512
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,038
John thought they were
some kind of spies or something.

513
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,535
More like "something."

514
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,661
<i>All three are access managers</i>

515
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,119
for the IDND, the International
Domain Name Directory.

516
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,086
Let's just pretend for a second

517
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,459
only you and Felicity
know what that is.

518
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,087
The Internet is run on domain names.
You start messing with them

519
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,294
and you start collapsing
whole parts of the Internet.

520
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,594
So Laurel was stealing fingerprints.

521
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,012
To gain access, I guess.

522
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,055
Well, why steal
three sets of fingerprints?

523
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,132
Wouldn't one do the job?

524
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,512
No, the Internet is
divided into sections,

525
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,060
so no one person can take it down
all at once.

526
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,103
Each manager controls a section.

527
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,102
And all three would be needed
to access the master vault,

528
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,058
which oversees all sections.

529
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,144
Right, so Cayden James wants to
take down the Internet?

530
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,227
Can he actually do that?

531
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,065
If you destroy the vault, yes.

532
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,699
And then what? I can't send an email?
I mean, so what?

533
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,402
The Internet controls everything now.

534
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,704
Electricity, water supply,
hospital equipment.

535
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,406
Also planes, trains and automobiles.

536
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,618
Alena said Cayden's casualty estimate
was 300 million people.

537
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,288
- Actually, that sounds low.
- I don't disagree.

538
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,207
This is all my fault.

539
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,587
All right,
let's keep our focus here.

540
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,213
So James and his people
wanna hit this vault.

541
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,420
Do we have a location on it?

542
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,797
The location is so classified,

543
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,304
they don't even a word
for how classified it is.

544
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,554
Be that as it may,
I have a hack running.

545
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,635
That'll give us a location soon.

546
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,563
Good. Which means you can get home,
take a shower, clear your head...

547
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,685
I'm fine.

548
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,482
It's not a request, Felicity.

549
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,111
Hey.

550
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,325
John told me what happened.

551
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:06,952
Hmm.

552
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,704
So I'm guessing this little visit is
his idea of therapy.

553
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,248
Actually, I'm thinking that
he probably wanted you

554
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,711
to speak to one of the world's
leading experts in guilt and regrets.

555
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,720
Hmm.

556
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,757
What's happening now
is not your fault.

557
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,347
Is that what I sounded like
all these years?

558
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,262
You sounded smarter.

559
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,185
How'd you do it?

560
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,982
How did you balance
being the Green Arrow,

561
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,981
the mayor, a boyfriend, a brother?

562
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,061
How did...

563
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,324
How did you do it all by yourself?

564
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,616
I didn't do it all by myself.

565
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:47,947
I had you.

566
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,163
Yeah, well, I know you're just
saying that to get boyfriend points,

567
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,710
and it's working.

568
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,788
I'm being serious, Felicity.

569
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,089
Even if we weren't together,

570
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,175
you were always there with me.

571
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,591
Always there to talk me out of stuff,

572
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,468
to help me being the Green Arrow.

573
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,892
You were literally in my ear

574
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,144
every second that I was in the field.

575
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,064
And that's why I followed you
to the club tonight.

576
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,767
Because I wanted the chance

577
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,978
to be there for you
the way that you've been there for me.

578
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,446
So then what would I say to you

579
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,494
in this situation?

580
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,196
You would

581
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,041
tell me that when I, you,

582
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,123
freed Cayden James,

583
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,625
I did it because,

584
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,048
at that moment, at that time,

585
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,000
in your heart,
you thought it was right.

586
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,294
Yeah.

587
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,463
You'd tell me
not to live in the past.

588
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,924
You'd tell me
to make it right in the present.

589
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,973
You'd tell me to trust myself.

590
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,349
Well, I am very smart, apparently.

591
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,355
So smart.

592
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,565
Sorry.

593
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,527
- This is becoming a habit.
- It is.

594
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,951
And I am incredibly proud.

595
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,171
Please.

596
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:32,140
I have a wife and two little girls.

597
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,221
I know.

598
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,394
I had a family once.

599
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,020
I appreciate your zeal, Ms. Lance,

600
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,697
but we just need people down,
not dead.

601
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,820
Do I question your methods?

602
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,822
Oh, a little gratitude, please.

603
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,324
Were it not for me,

604
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,579
you would've either starved
or bled to death on Lian Yu.

605
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,046
The Pre-Socratic philosopher
Thales of Miletus,

606
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,469
known as the Father of Science,

607
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,761
believed that for any event
there was a natural cause,

608
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,262
even if we couldn't see it.

609
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,017
And he thought that
with perfect knowledge,

610
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,478
man could control anything.

611
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,613
Everything.

612
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,955
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you?

613
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,461
Oh, I'm just beginning.

614
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,509
Welcome to the inner sanctum.

615
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,656
He's gone.

616
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,286
Biometric hand scanners.

617
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,457
So cool.
Except for the dead body part.

618
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,167
Stay sharp.

619
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,090
This place is huge.

620
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,669
Yeah, well, it has to be big to
hold, you know, the whole Internet.

621
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,095
This way.

622
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,476
- Cayden's overclocking the vault CPU.
- English, Felicity.

623
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,645
He put a virus in the system that's
gonna make the whole thing explode.

624
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,017
That's a bit too much English.

625
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,225
How much time do we have
before the vault goes boom?

626
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,938
Six minutes.
I think I can stop the virus.

627
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,815
I just need one minute.

628
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,895
There's no way
Cayden James and Laurel

629
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,400
are gonna let you just stand there
and do that.

630
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,107
Get down!

631
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,906
You weren't wrong.

632
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,584
Your men have engaged the targets.

633
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,081
Our men, Ms. Lance.

634
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,789
This partnership is a democracy,
after all.

635
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,041
Oh.

636
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,048
Ms. Smoak just appeared
on the server.

637
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,922
Clever girl.

638
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,389
Her ingenuity never disappoints.

639
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,730
I'm coding a little something
to occupy her

640
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,059
while I take my leave.

641
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,066
Do the same for her friends,
would you?

642
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,825
No, no, no, no, no!

643
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,278
"No" is not what we wanna
hear right now!

644
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,329
Cayden just used the processor's
firewall to block me out.

645
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,532
I can't shut down the virus
remotely now.

646
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,615
I'm gonna have to do it onsite

647
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,700
before he turns this whole place
into an ashtray.

648
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,035
Not to mention,
you know, the Internet.

649
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,166
- Where's the processor?
- Northwest quadrant.

650
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,748
Fine. We'll cover you.
Delta formation!

651
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,306
Fall back!

652
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,480
We're outgunned here.

653
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,682
We've got you covered.
Can you handle this?

654
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,859
I can handle it. Just keep them
off of me for four minutes.

655
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,311
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

656
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,661
Maybe doing this solo
wasn't such a good idea.

657
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,118
- Good thing you're not alone.
- Oliver?

658
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,545
Technically if I'm in this chair
that makes me Overwatch.

659
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,839
- You're in the bunker?
- I am. You okay with that?

660
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,086
I'm all right with that.
I'm so all right with that.

661
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,212
I'm epically all right with that.

662
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,759
Especially if you have eyes
on this complex.

663
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,552
I think I do.

664
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,755
You've automated this system
to the point

665
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,180
that William could
basically operate it.

666
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,225
Do you see the room
in the far northwest quadrant?

667
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,849
I do. But I also see 10 hostiles
between you and it.

668
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,396
So let me put on the safest path.

669
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,317
Take the corridor to your left.

670
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,942
Are you sure about that?

671
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,698
Sorry, right.
My left. Your right.

672
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,234
Just a little bit
of a learning curve here.

673
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:01,704
Overwatch. Sitrep.

674
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,118
<i>Overwatch, what's your situation?</i>

675
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,290
She's fine.

676
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,372
<i>Stop.</i>

677
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,545
<i>Go right.</i>

678
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,665
Under the door.

679
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,092
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

680
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,047
- Coast is clear.
- Good.

681
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,684
I'm in.

682
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,305
Cayden's not here.

683
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,233
Time to get to work.

684
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,905
Company, nine o'clock.

685
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,916
I knew you'd be
around here somewhere.

686
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,411
Well, I couldn't stay away from you.

687
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,542
Except for you've changed
something about yourself.

688
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,420
I just can't quite
put my finger on it.

689
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,009
Let me help you with that.

690
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,976
So it's the crossbow?

691
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,816
That's cute.

692
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,018
Two more hostiles inbound.

693
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,896
There! There!

694
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,573
Oh, thank you for that.

695
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,192
Just wanted to give you
a little time.

696
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,652
Yeah, well, I'm gonna need it.

697
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,453
I have to break through
the processor's protective firewall

698
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,121
to stop Cayden's virus.

699
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,824
Add the fact that the processor
is exponentially overclocking,

700
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,409
and he's disabled the cooling system.

701
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,838
Did not understand a single word
that you just said.

702
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,340
Well, you understand blaring noises

703
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,962
and really scary lights, right?

704
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,297
I know this.

705
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,175
You can do it.

706
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,632
I believe in you.

707
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,100
Time to go.

708
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,908
- Thanks.
- No problem.

709
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,071
If this place is going to go boom,
let's not be here when it does.

710
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,497
Overwatch, how're we doing?

711
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,032
<i>Overwatch?</i>

712
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,337
Good job.

713
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,087
And we're not dead.

714
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,258
Told you.

715
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,433
Yeah. You know, if this whole
role-reversal thing sticks around,

716
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,976
you're really gonna
have to adopt my saying,

717
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,644
"I'm not saying I told you so."

718
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,513
You tell me you told me so.

719
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,062
Yeah. But not all the time.

720
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,817
Thank you.

721
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,104
I'm just glad I found a way to help.

722
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,691
You always do.

723
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,116
Thank God we saved the Internet.

724
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,365
My fantasy football team
was killing it this year.

725
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,789
So this new partnership,

726
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,797
- is it permanent?
- I certainly hope not.

727
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,298
I think Mayor Queen's
probably too busy

728
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,875
to be moonlighting as tech support.

729
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,594
Besides, after all those years
in the field,

730
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,797
it'd be a shame if you went down
for carpal tunnel.

731
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,509
All kidding aside,

732
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,762
we need to focus on why Laurel has
aligned herself with Cayden James.

733
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,304
Those operatives,

734
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,231
they were the same ones
that we took out last month.

735
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,522
Sorry. Old habits.

736
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,773
I will leave you to it.

737
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,239
I'll come with you.
I'm gonna go tell Alena the good news.

738
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,454
Thank you.

739
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,161
No need to thank me.
Saving the world is kinda what we do.

740
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,921
- Mmm.
- That, and fixing our mistakes.

741
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,375
None of this is on you, Felicity.

742
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,130
I vouched for Cayden.

743
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,711
You were just backing my play.

744
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,387
Yeah, well, like you said,
he changed.

745
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,140
Yeah.

746
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,894
Now that you're no longer working
for an evil über-hacker...

747
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,305
- I'm just assuming.
- Hmm...

748
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,315
Do you know what you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

749
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,190
I'm gonna take some time.

750
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,616
And gain some
much-needed perspective.

751
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,120
And then, maybe, if you'll have me,

752
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,455
come work for you at your start-up?

753
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,873
Yeah, that'd be great.

754
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,495
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you should.

755
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,750
I mean, maybe in a year or two,

756
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,874
Curtis and I'll actually have an idea
of what to develop.

757
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,081
Oh, actually, I have a pitch for you
on that.

758
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,708
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

759
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,460
Why did you get fired
from Palmer Tech?

760
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,092
Well, besides me being lousy
at balancing my time

761
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,556
and working with the team?

762
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,680
The board actually violently
resisted my...

763
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,682
Efforts to replicate
your spinal implant.

764
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,725
Yeah.

765
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,016
You've been looking
for something to work on,

766
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,901
something that would
change the world,

767
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,856
and you've literally been sitting
on the right idea this whole time.

768
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,940
I couldn't figure out a way

769
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,026
to affordably mass-produce
the implant at Palmer Tech...

770
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,076
But now you have Curtis
and no board oversight.

771
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,207
You know, Curtis and I
have actually had a really hard time

772
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,579
coming up with
a name for the company,

773
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,878
almost as hard a time
as we have for a concept...

774
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,956
So, I was wondering
how you would feel about me

775
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,666
appropriating the name Helix?

776
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,087
Well, I think you don't generally
need to worry about criminal hackers

777
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,013
coming after you
for trademark infringement.

778
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,886
- That's true.
<i>- And I think</i>

779
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,509
it would be really nice

780
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,102
to see something good
come of the name.

781
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,349
- "Helix Dynamics."
- That rolls off the tongue nicely.

782
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,104
Cool logo possibilities,

783
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,651
easily engravable on a Nobel medal...

784
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,649
Funny, those are
Curtis's criteria, too.

785
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,772
I think it's possible.

786
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,200
A reward for a job only half done?

787
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,907
A means of preventing them
from tracking you

788
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,287
by way of your sonic scream.

789
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,369
And the job was done to perfection.

790
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,205
I thought the objective
was to take down the Internet.

791
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,258
Oh, no, the objective was to take down
the firewall protecting the vault.

792
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,721
And Ms. Smoak
was most adept in complying.

793
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,092
Why couldn't you
find a way to do it yourself?

794
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,428
I've been doing this too long
to leave trails, Ms. Lance.

795
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,184
Much safer to have Ms. Smoak's

796
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,891
digital fingerprints
on the processor, not mine.

797
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,018
And once she helped taken down
the firewall,

798
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,648
I was able to upload

799
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,945
a critical piece of code to Arclight.

800
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,951
What happens now?

801
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,945
We take the next step.

802
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,711
Dinner went better than expected.

803
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,172
I can't believe we got through
the whole thing. No interruptions,

804
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,724
no armed assassins...

805
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,606
And I still have room for dessert.

806
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,399
So do I.

807
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,940
- Wait.
- That's okay.

808
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,491
Oh, sorry.

809
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,159
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

810
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,406
- Sorry.
- Oh!

811
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,333
Sorry. Not mine.

812
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,995
- Thank you.
- Oh.

813
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:07,996
- One sec.
- Yeah.

814
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,006
Hello.

815
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,005
Hi.

816
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,139
Okay.

817
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,643
I'll be there.

818
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,775
Mmm-mmm. All right.

819
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,571
That didn't sound like John
or the team.

820
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:33,940
It wasn't.

821
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,737
What's going on?

822
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,236
That was Slade Wilson.

823
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,363
He needs my help.
