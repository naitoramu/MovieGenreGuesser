1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,891
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,242
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,128
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,567
To save my city.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,764
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,921
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,006
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,091
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,970
- Ivo killed Shado.
- Because I chose to save you.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,970
The man who killed Shado
is still out there.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,811
But not for long,
because we're gonna take the freighter.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,527
Merlyn is Thea's father. But I thought
you deserved to tell Oliver yourself.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,848
I'm not going to tell my son anything.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,169
Thea can never find out about Merlyn.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,882
As of right now we have no relationship.
You and I are done.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,809
Sweetheart, you okay?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,004
Every single thing that's gone wrong
in our lives is your fault.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,890
- Now get out.
- I'm sorry.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,565
I said, get out!

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,842
In six seconds,
lobby security will undergo a shift change.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,246
When that happens,
make for the elevator bay.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,844
Copy.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,481
Remember what I told you:
Timing is everything.

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,363
Maintain a pace of 1.3 meters per second.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,723
Six seconds to target, five, four...

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,641
Now is the time, gentlemen.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,285
It's a fingerprint reader.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,204
- I can't crack it.
- I can.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,049
You have 5.3 seconds
to get down the east stairwell.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,446
Stop.

31
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,564
What the hell are we doing?

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,603
We got what we came for.

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,285
He said to wait.

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,967
Out in the open? Forget this.

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,965
Don't do it. Don't do...

36
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,651
Security clocked us.

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,164
S.C.P.D., you gotta
send some officers here.

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,805
Third floor, third floor.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,929
They've alerted the S.C.P.D.

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,041
Exit the east lobby in 22 seconds.

41
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,451
S.C.P.D.! Put your weapons down!

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,126
Walczak.

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,324
Delta-Charlie 52 to Central.
Shots fired. Need backup. Downtown.

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,484
Get out of here! Get out! Move!

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,966
Power to the people.

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,009
- Dig!
- Sara, I'm so sorry.

47
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,208
- It's okay. I'm fine.
- Let me see.

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,847
Let me see.

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,170
She's bleeding.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,290
But it's not deep.

51
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,369
Good, I can't take any more scars.
Speaking of, mortar round?

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,246
Yeah, IED, Paktika Province,
Afghanistan. Good eye.

53
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,171
I know my wounds. Grenade, Algiers.

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,511
I've never been
hit by a grenade.

55
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,510
All those scars, you've
never been hit by a grenade?

56
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,330
Arrow, knife, knife.
Lot of bullets, no grenades.

57
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,364
I got myself a new bullet.
9mm right there.

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,961
Thirty-eight. I'm mostly swords.
And a spear.

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,889
I have a scar.

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,127
It's in my mouth.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,243
Had my wisdom teeth removed
when I was 16.

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,728
Three stitches.
They were really badly impacted.

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,410
You're still cute.

64
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,323
We should get going. You don't wanna be
late for your own welcome-home party.

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,131
You didn't have to throw me a party, Ollie.

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,710
Sara, when you come back from the dead, you
get a party. It's a Queen family tradition.

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
I don't know how well
that's gonna work with the

68
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,988
Lance family tradition of
holding grudges forever.

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,680
- She'll come around.
- Maybe.

70
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,407
And maybe we should keep what's going on
between you and me between us.

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,647
For Laurel's sake.

72
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,566
I get that.

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,009
I survived Lian Yu and Nanda Parbat.
I guess I can handle a cocktail party.

74
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,321
I wouldn't be so sure.

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,765
We're never gonna make it. Ivo has eight
guards on deck at all times, all armed.

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,769
The second they see us, we're dead.

77
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,925
Assuming we can deal
with Ivo's defenses,

78
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,194
how will we get close
enough to board the ship?

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,768
- Maybe we build a raft.
- It'll take us weeks to find the timber.

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,810
- We don't have weeks.
- I have been on this island for 264 days.

81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,840
- All I have is weeks.
- Shut up.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,447
- You don't have to stick up for me, Ollie.
- What? No, both of you shut up.

83
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,201
Listen. Do you hear that?

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,121
- Hey!
- Hey!

85
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,608
- Hey!
- Hey!

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,131
Hey!

87
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,123
- Hey, down here!
- Help!

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,929
- Hey!
- Hey!

89
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,803
You left us
sitting in front of the security camera.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,321
Guards could've killed us.

91
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,483
Are you listening?

92
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,001
If you had simply waited
for five more seconds...

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,641
like you were told,
no one would've died.

94
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,006
Sorry, I wasn't gonna bet 10 to 20 up in Iron
Heights on your skills with a stopwatch.

95
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,931
"The strongest of all
warriors are these two:

96
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,526
- Time and patience."
- What?

97
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,802
It's from War and Peace, 1440 pages.
It takes a while, but it's worth the read.

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,166
Tolstoy knew that patience
was the epitome of strength.

99
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,527
It takes fortitude to stand still.

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,011
Just as it is a sign of weakness or
cowardice to move when you should not!

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,363
Look, we did the job. You owe me.

102
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,325
The dead are owed nothing.

103
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,129
- Uh, come in. Come in, come in.
- Heh.

104
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,726
Welcome home, Sara.

105
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,251
I'm so happy you're here. Come on.

106
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,084
- Oh.
- Uh, Sara, this is Sin.

107
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,361
- Wait, do you two know each other?
- No, uh, we don't.

108
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,364
Right. I just...

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,086
I love when people come back
from the dead. You know?

110
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,248
Juices my zombie fetish.

111
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,731
- Hmm.
- Oh.

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,281
- Uh, Roy.
- Sara.

113
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,970
Come on.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,126
Sorry.

115
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,167
Laurel, it's Ollie.

116
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,741
I hope you're coming
to the party.

117
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:31,307
I heard that you maybe were a
little mad at Sara, and I...

118
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,283
She's your sister and...

119
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,762
I mean, you only get one.

120
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,282
Yeah... Bye.

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,885
Hey.

122
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,645
Laurel is not coming.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,205
Maybe she just needs time.

124
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,006
Yeah. Yeah, I needed time too.

125
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,801
When you got back, I...

126
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,805
Well, I was pretty harsh on you.

127
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,806
- Mr. Lance, you don't have to...
- Oh, I do.

128
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,846
When you and Sara went off on your dad's
boat, you were just a kid, both of you were.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,122
And whether she came back or...

130
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,689
I was out of line.

131
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,966
You're not a killer, Oliver.

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,480
- Yeah.
- Come on.

133
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,246
There is something

134
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,243
I'm so happy for you, Dinah.

135
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,644
Those five years that Oliver was gone
was like a piece of me was missing.

136
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,325
I know just what you mean.

137
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,722
- Oh, excuse me.
- Of course.

138
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,328
I didn't think you'd be here.

139
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,481
This is my house.

140
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,366
And if you don't wanna pretend
to be mother and son...

141
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,126
then don't throw parties in my home.

142
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,367
Mom, is everything okay with you and Ollie?

143
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,607
Yes, of course.

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,746
Because Detective Lance
just got the same call.

160
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,641
So, you guys just show up
to every crime scene now?

161
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,046
We saw you leave.

162
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,444
CSU just pulled this out of a skel
I know named Eddie Walczak.

163
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,563
I've never seen a knife like this.

164
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,001
It's not a knife. It's a minute hand.

165
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,571
Like from a clock.

166
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,811
I popped Walczak for B and E
a few years back.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,561
This morning, he and an accomplice
were involved in a robbery-homicide.

168
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,842
- What'd they steal?
- Some high-tech gizmo.

169
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,560
Kord rep called it a, um, skeleton key.

170
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,290
- What? Know what it is?
- It was intended as a military tool...

171
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,960
to aid in code-breaking
on foreign intelligence targets.

172
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,642
Felicity Smoak works
at Queen Consolidated.

173
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,047
She said they were working
on something similar.

174
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,409
But Oliver Queen shut it down
once he realized what it could be used for.

175
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,271
What?

176
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,309
It could be modified
to open a bank vault.

177
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,804
Any bank vault.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,811
Ok, listen, Walczak's
small-time on a good day.

179
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:00,981
I mean, I doubt he'd even
know how to use this thing...

180
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,520
let alone break into a place like Kord
and steal it on his own.

181
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,250
Walczak was just the muscle.

182
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,361
We need to find the brain.

183
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,323
Plant your feet.

184
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,164
Strong foundation equals stronger punch.

185
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,450
Nice. If this is for self-defense,
I'd recommend Wing Chun.

186
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,677
It uses your opponent's
strength against him,

187
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,671
so it's ideal for smaller people...
like us.

188
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,366
You seem like you can take care
of yourself just fine.

189
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,650
- You okay?
- Where are we with the skeleton key?

190
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,527
And what are you wearing?

191
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,920
I just thought I'd...

192
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,765
I'm cross-referencing
Walczak's known associates

193
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,828
with decryption experts
on the NSA watch list.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,048
- But it's taking some time.
- Which we don't have.

195
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,528
Ok, the key is not just a code-breaker.
In the wrong hands, it's a weapon.

196
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,281
Whoever killed Walczak, in addition
to finding creepy uses for clock parts...

197
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,283
is very good at covering his tracks.

198
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,087
Lucky for us, uncovering tracks
is what you're very good at.

199
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,644
Right.

200
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,724
Of course.

201
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,202
He's barely alive. Do you have
medical supplies in the fuselage?

202
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,121
- We have some, but...
- Just go. I'll be fine.

203
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,086
Hey.

204
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,722
I'm really starting to
regret giving you a key.

205
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,186
I'm sorry I bailed on the party.

206
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,470
I figured you wouldn't
make an appearance.

207
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,007
Finally, someone understands.

208
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,288
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

209
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,724
But I understand how Sara keeping it a
secret that she was still alive could hurt.

210
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,121
Because it hurt me too.

211
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,051
- I sense a "but" coming in my future.
- But... Yes.

212
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,049
But I need you to move past it.

213
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,684
Laurel.

214
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,363
A family dinner. It's a
chance to reconcile.

215
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,770
I don't wanna reconcile with Sara.

216
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,170
I'm not talking about you and Sara.
I'm talking about...

217
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,767
me and your mom.

218
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,567
What do you mean?

219
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,402
I don't know how to describe it.
It was like there was, um, signals...

220
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,810
and feelings.

221
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,257
And I'm not exactly
sure what's going on,

222
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:57,633
but I figured if we're all
together as a family...

223
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,888
maybe it'll remind her
of how happy we were.

224
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,684
You know? I mean, I don't know, maybe...

225
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,290
- Is this stupid?
- No, it...

226
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,048
Ahem. Go for Delta-Charlie 52.

227
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,483
415 in progress. Widmeer
Bank. Lieutenant requesting all units.

228
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,007
Delta-Charlie 52 responding.

229
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,690
I gotta go.

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,525
Tonight.

231
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,682
Eight-thirty.

232
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,365
- Tell everyone to be here.
- What?

233
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,801
Well, your place is too small and...

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,446
No offense, it's kind of a mess, so...

235
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,410
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Okay.

236
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,204
I love you.

237
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,201
Okay.

238
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,568
- Device is hot.
- Three-point-two seconds.

239
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,807
Extract as much money as you can
in 90 seconds.

240
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,611
Stop. Get out of there.

241
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,882
- We still got 20 seconds.
- No, you don't.

242
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,647
Go.

243
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,367
- They're already gone.
- I think I have an idea where.

244
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,801
The skeleton key operates
on an OFDM wireless signal.

245
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,030
I'm picking up a transmission signal
in the alley next to the bank.

246
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,566
But you won't be heading there.

247
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,920
- What was that?
- He's hacked our transmission.

248
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,048
My associates may be headed to the alley,
but the 940 bus from Crescent Circle...

249
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,608
is about to collide
with the Starling freight express.

250
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh my God, he's right, the 910
is headed for the track at Amherst.

251
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,811
By my calculations,
you can't be in two places at once.

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,923
He doesn't know there's two of us.

253
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,286
Come on! Come on!

254
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,883
He's in the Transit Department network.

255
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,849
He's hacked the signaling system.

256
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,923
I can't get the crossing barriers down.

257
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,731
Those buses have radios.
Can you break in, wave them off?

258
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,405
No, he's keeping me out.

259
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,257
According to authorities
at the S.C.P.D...

260
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:56,151
It's not real until the media
comes up with a nickname.

261
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,248
How can I run a bar without any bartenders?

262
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,410
For that matter, how can you quit
without giving me notice?

263
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,042
One hour before opening
is not notice, Mandy.

264
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,084
Can I talk to you for a second?

265
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,450
I'm gonna go use the little blonds' room.

266
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,367
- Everything okay?
- You tell me.

267
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,881
Other than the party,
I haven't seen you all week.

268
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,644
Uh, I've been busy.

269
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,167
Being a CEO
doesn't leave me a lot of free time.

270
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,046
It looks to me a whole lot
like you're avoiding Mom.

271
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,651
I'm not avoiding Mom.

272
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,328
You're lucky your life
does not revolve around lying.

273
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,921
Thea, everything's fine.

274
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,470
You know, it's secrets that pushed this
family apart in the first place, Ollie.

275
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,324
Speedy, Speedy, really.

276
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,643
Everything's fine.

277
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,651
- What do we know?
- He hacked into our frequency.

278
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,844
Somehow gained remote access.
But I upgraded our firewall.

279
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,362
Now he won't be able to tap into our comms
even if he had a bazooka.

280
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,246
- You know, computer science-wise.
- Good.

281
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,761
I think I have something that might
help us track him down.

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,049
- I can run that to the lab.
- I spent a year on the freighter...

283
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,642
studying genetic blood anomalies.
I kinda know my way around a microscope.

284
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,370
There's some significant cell damage,
and the platelet count is extremely low.

285
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,122
Felicity, can I use your computer?

286
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,041
MacGregor's syndrome.

287
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,210
It's a genetic defect that creates
fluid buildup in the lungs...

288
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,047
which leads to oxygen deprivation
and multisystem organ failure.

289
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,611
It's terminal.

290
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,681
But the syndrome may gives
us a way to ID him.

291
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:43,465
People with MacGregor's
are extremely rare.

292
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,888
People with MacGregor's and a degree
in computer science are even more rare.

293
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,127
William Tockman.

294
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,006
Former encryption engineer at...
Wait for it... Kord Enterprises.

295
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,602
What's the point? He'll be dead
before he can spend all the money.

296
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,080
He's not stealing the money for himself.

297
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,771
He's using it for his family.
His sister, specifically.

298
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,161
She's got cystic fibrosis
and needs a lung transplant.

299
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,203
Give me an address, please.

300
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,209
52 Nelson Way.

301
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,923
This area doesn't look very residential.

302
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,806
There. That's Tockman's ride.

303
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,881
- Tockman's not here. Just some device.
- I'm on it. Whatever's in the truck...

304
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,850
is transmitting the same OFDM signal
Tockman used at the bank.

305
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,281
- Can you trace it?
- As we speak.

306
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,681
It's leading...

307
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,729
back to our network.

308
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,287
Tockman's piggybacking off my hack.
It's a trap.

309
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,246
- He's trying to break into our network.
- I'm not trying.

310
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,930
I am.

311
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,650
Where are you?

312
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,047
Are you home?

313
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,761
Are you safe?
Somewhere you think you're safe?

314
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,009
Somewhere without windows
for anyone to creep through?

315
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,601
Underground, perhaps?

316
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,210
You think no one can get to you?

317
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,562
You think no one can touch you
in the safety of your hidey hole?

318
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,285
Felicity.

319
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,448
But I can.

320
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,124
How bad?

321
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,491
Tockman used the skeleton key
to penetrate our firewall...

322
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,451
and recode our security.

323
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
Basically he told our system
to commit suicide.

324
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,810
And it did.

325
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,445
Bravo, Clock King.

326
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,889
Sara stopped Tockman's men
before they could get away with the cash.

327
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,880
So Tockman is gonna be looking
for another score.

328
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,008
Maybe we should give him one.

329
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,969
Call Walter and have him liquidate
500,000 shares of QC stock.

330
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,250
Put it in cash in my vault
at Starling National.

331
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,771
And ask him to do it tonight.

332
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,889
If Tockman wants to make another score...

333
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,442
Who better to rob
than a suddenly cash-flush Oliver Queen.

334
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,644
- And what if he doesn't take the bait?
- It's a good point.

335
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,928
- Make it 800,000 shares.
- Okay.

336
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,929
- What can I do?
- Go to your dinner.

337
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,849
Family's probably waiting for you.

338
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,205
Right.

339
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,002
Dinner at Laurel's.

340
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,766
This is more important.

341
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,406
Can't do anything here, Sara.

342
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,485
Your family's important too.

343
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,401
- Yeah.
- Hey.

344
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,849
- You should go.
- Will you go with me?

345
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,007
What?

346
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,766
I know I wanted us all
to get together for a while now.

347
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,327
It's just now that it's actually here,
I'm nervous.

348
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,560
I mean, last time I saw Laurel,
it didn't go very well...

349
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,567
and it'd be helpful
to not have to go alone.

350
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,603
I should probably stay here.

351
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,525
What is it exactly
you think you can do here to help?

352
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,683
- Hmm?
- Call if you need us.

353
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,565
Yep.

354
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,606
- You know, it's not your fault, Felicity.
- Really?

355
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,963
Which one of the rest of you
put up the security safeguards?

356
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,563
Maybe if it had been Sara,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

357
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,213
Now, I know we haven't
talked about this.

358
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,310
But it must be difficult for
you seeing them together.

359
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,163
This isn't about them being together.

360
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,364
This is about me, okay?

361
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,487
Sara can analyze blood, she can kick ass,
she can do anything.

362
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,251
And the one thing I'm supposed to be
good at, I'm failing at miserably.

363
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,606
I mean, why do you even need me
now that you have her?

364
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,684
Because you're irreplaceable, Felicity.

365
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,889
I have a lot of work to do.

366
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,011
Laurel, Sara's here.

367
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,404
Oh. Heh.

368
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,006
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

369
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,123
Oliver, uh, thank you. These are lovely.

370
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,810
Thank you.

371
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,365
Hey.

372
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,287
I don't remember your
last name being Lance.

373
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,114
Well, yeah...

374
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,925
I certainly didn't wanna crash
your family dinner.

375
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,726
But Sara and I ran into each other,
and she mentioned it.

376
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,208
And I told him how Dad is making
his famous chicken cacciatore.

377
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,602
- Actually... Excuse me.
- Oh!

378
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,848
We're, uh... We're... Oliver?

379
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,485
Hey, Mr. Lance.

380
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,249
Yeah, uh, we're having pizza. I'm sorry,
I had a little incident in the kitchen.

381
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,762
I guess that's what happens when you
haven't used an oven in six years. Ha, ha.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,047
Wanna grab a slice?

383
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,441
Yeah, well,
that was kitchen towel cacciatore.

384
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,244
- Cacciatore towel, yeah.
- Ha, ha.

385
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,602
Are you still teaching, Mrs. Lance?

386
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,765
Yes, I am. Greek and medieval history
at Central City University.

387
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,890
- Wow.
- You could probably give them notice.

388
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,206
Why would I do that?

389
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,006
Well, I mean, you're gonna come back
to Starling, right?

390
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,727
No, I'm not moving back
to Starling, Quentin.

391
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,206
Well, Sara's back.

392
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,048
I have a new life in Central City,
and I have a wonderful job.

393
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,805
Well, there's jobs here.

394
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,890
More than a job, um...

395
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,926
I have someone.

396
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,521
Oh. Congratulations.

397
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,802
You know, it's great, Mom.

398
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,442
You deserve to be happy.

399
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,682
- Everybody does.
- Yep.

400
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,008
You've gotta be kidding me.

401
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,565
What?

402
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,730
You've been back like, what, a week?

403
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,490
And you're not even denying it.

404
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,687
It's... It's complicated.

405
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,803
Of course it is. It's you.

406
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,725
- Laurel, please.
- Dad, you are no better than they are.

407
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,029
I mean, what did you think Mom
was just gonna sit around

408
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,990
and wait for you for six
years to bake her chicken?

409
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,401
- Laurel, enough.
- And sweep her back off her feet?

410
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,562
- Enough, okay?
- You know what? It is enough.

411
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,127
You let yourselves out when you're done.

412
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,291
- My wallet.
- Okay.

413
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,291
She's my daughter.

414
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,649
She's 12.

415
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,131
I need to talk to her.

416
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,163
Your radio is broken.

417
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,089
Her mother died
just after she got out of diapers.

418
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,362
Cancer.

419
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,930
And without me, she's not gonna have
anybody to look after her.

420
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,924
I know I don't know you,
and I know you don't know me.

421
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,725
Please, make sure my daughter's okay.

422
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,570
Please.

423
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,202
- Hey.
- You are unbelievable.

424
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,405
You lecture me on how I need
to repair my relationship with Sara...

425
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,321
when you're the one who messed it up
in the first place by screwing her.

426
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,164
And now you're doing it again.

427
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,684
- You're right, this is all my fault.
- Yeah, yeah, yes, it is.

428
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,927
And is you losing your job...

429
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,010
doing drugs and being a drunk,
is that my fault?

430
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,969
Is that your family's fault?
Or are you gonna blame Tommy for dying?

431
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,366
Screw you, Oliver.

432
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,849
I have stood by you through everything.
The DUI, losing your job.

433
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,258
I was concerned about
your well-being when you

434
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,507
were trying to get my
mother the death penalty.

435
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,001
Yeah, and you've been
a real stand-up kind of guy.

436
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,050
Do you think you're the only one
that is having a hard time?

437
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,005
Do you think you're the only one
with family issues?

438
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,410
You have no idea what is going on
with my family right now.

439
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,648
But I am still standing here.

440
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,684
And you are still blaming
everybody but yourself.

441
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,085
Are you done?

442
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,605
Yeah.

443
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,123
Yeah, I'm done.

444
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,086
I'm done taking the blame.

445
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,208
And I'm done caring.

446
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,125
Why don't you go have a drink?

447
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,482
Get wasted. Go...

448
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,084
Go to Verdant.

449
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,929
I'll pay for it.

450
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,328
I have loved you for half my life.

451
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,687
But I'm done running after you.

452
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,730
- Have you seen Felicity?
- No.

453
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,804
- Wait, why?
- I went to Big Belly to get some takeout.

454
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,401
When I came back, she was gone.
I haven't seen her for hours.

455
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,770
- Hey.
- Tockman took the bait.

456
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,644
The money you had Walter deposit.

457
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,631
I'm reading his signal
at Starling National.

458
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:42,656
Wait.

459
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,206
- How do you know that?
- Because I'm here.

460
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,041
What?

461
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,687
- What are you doing here?
- Tracking Tockman.

462
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,248
He fried our computer, so I'm using the
bank's to trace the skeleton key signature.

463
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,961
- And the jacket?
- I was cold.

464
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,726
- Mm.
- Diggle, get her out of here.

465
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,361
Tockman disabled the bank's
security system. I re-abled it.

466
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,642
They're blocking our way out.

467
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,280
I'll deal with them.

468
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,174
Tockman's signal is strong.
He's here, he's close.

469
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:39,899
Find him.

470
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,491
No need.

471
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,047
I'll tell you exactly where I am.

472
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,651
I'm everywhere.

473
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,168
At the moment, I'm particularly focused
on the sublevel.

474
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,402
The gas mains, specifically.

475
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,882
Oh, my God,
he shut down the gas main release.

476
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,526
- Why's that bad?
- Buildup could cause an explosion.

477
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,674
It will. It'll blow
up three square blocks.

478
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:02,699
No, it won't.

479
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,481
Wait. Tockman overplayed his hand.
The gas main's in the city's network.

480
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,451
- That's where I live.
- Am I supposed to understand that?

481
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,204
Um... In trying to blow us up,
he gave me a way to track him down.

482
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,124
That I understood.

483
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,645
What's happening?

484
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,921
Watch out!

485
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,603
You don't even know why I'm doing this.

486
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,926
The money's not for me.

487
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,646
- I'm doing this all for her.
- Doesn't make it right.

488
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,440
- Tempus fugit.
- "Time flies."

489
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,081
- What the hell was that?
- His cell phone.

490
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,807
I uploaded the same virus
he used on my gear in the foundry.

491
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,126
- I didn't just kill him, did I?
- Just knocked him out.

492
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,688
- We did it.
- You did it.

493
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,605
Are you sure
you don't wanna go to the hospital?

494
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,969
Mm-mm. You guys never go to the hospital.

495
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,807
Besides, Dig gave me
some of those aspirins.

496
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,804
Are you spinning?

497
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,720
- Aspirin?
- Oxycodone.

498
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,171
I wouldn't be here
if you hadn't been so brave.

499
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,010
Thank you.

500
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,369
It was nothing.

501
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,446
I've always wanted to say I've taken
a bullet for someone, and now I can.

502
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,047
So really I should be thanking you.

503
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,886
- All done.
- Mm.

504
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,845
Not bad, but you're still
gonna have a scar.

505
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,528
My own scar. Yay.

506
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,487
Are you all right?

507
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,005
Diggle had mentioned that maybe you
were feeling a little left out.

508
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,571
What?

509
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,530
No.

510
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,841
I was just used to being your girl.

511
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,886
I mean, not your "girl" girl. Heh.

512
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,883
Your girl.

513
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,526
I know it sounds like the same word, but
it means something different in my head.

514
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,820
Mm.

515
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:34,505
Hey, you will always
be my girl, Felicity.

516
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,360
Can I have another one
of those aspirins, please?

517
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,130
- Hi.
- Try this.

518
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,246
Good, huh?

519
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,125
- It's really good.
- Mm.

520
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,921
And what are you doing back here
mixing drinks?

521
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,489
Thea hired me.

522
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,047
I am the new bartender.

523
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,929
Uh-huh.

524
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,721
I bartended in college, and, uh, well,
it's kind of hard to get a job...

525
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,811
when "international assassin"
is the highlight of your résumé.

526
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,128
- You're gonna do great.
- Heh.

527
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,169
- I have to go home.
- Is everything okay?

528
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,324
I hope so.

529
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,364
You can go.

530
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,163
I'm not here to kill her or anything.

531
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,684
I remember you used to bartend
at that skeevy bar...

532
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,602
with the peanut shells
all over the floor.

533
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,685
The Bolivian.

534
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,045
Right.

535
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,641
I'm not here for a drink or anything.

536
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,088
Then why are you here?

537
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,881
Because I realized that...

538
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,209
That I went on that boat with you too.

539
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,650
And...

540
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,128
I've been slowly drowning
for all of these years.

541
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,167
And after every...

542
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,321
heartbreak or...

543
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,605
setback or loss...

544
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,286
I sank deeper into the dark water.

545
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,727
And so when I saw you...

546
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,204
so beautiful and so alive...

547
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,570
I realized that I'm not those things.

548
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,889
Not anymore.

549
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,642
So please...

550
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,520
please don't hate me, Sara.

551
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,007
Please.

552
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,768
God, I missed you.

553
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,323
Didn't think anything could make you cry.

554
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,643
Guess I'm not as tough as you thought.

555
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,331
So why the running mascara?

556
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,606
I had...

557
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,610
I just had a moment with my sister.

558
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,442
It was a good one.

559
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,486
That's good.

560
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,009
Hey, Laurel is my big sister.
I still have room for a little one.

561
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,690
Good.

562
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,649
Don't know what I'd do without you.

563
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,124
Well, you won't have to find out.

564
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,328
I'm gonna go find Roy.

565
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,362
- Got it.
- It's too late.

566
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,171
He's gone.

567
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,883
We're all gonna die here, just like him.

568
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,641
No, we're not.

569
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,481
I think I found our way onto the freighter.

570
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,927
Parachute.

571
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,487
- Thea?
- Oliver.

572
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,486
- What's wrong? ls everything all right?
- Thea texted me...

573
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,206
- there was an emergency at the house.
- No emergency.

574
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm in the middle of a meeting,
and Thea's not even here.

575
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:09,150
Well, then why would she...?

576
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,768
- I can't believe she would do this.
- Do what?

577
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,830
She's trying to force us to talk. Because
she's sensing the tension between us.

578
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,683
- And what did you tell her?
- Nothing.

579
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,889
To protect her.

580
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,567
Not you.

581
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,807
Mrs. Queen, is everything okay?

582
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,530
Yes, thank you.

583
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,242
Uh, my son just dropped by.

584
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,011
Oliver, I'd like you to meet Slade Wilson.

585
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,605
It's a pleasure to meet you...

586
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,211
Mr. Queen.
