1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,397
<i>Previously on "Arrow"...</i>

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,857
- I need your help, Roy.
- You really think

3
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:06,721
<i>an energy weapon's
gonna stop this Monitor guy?</i>

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,677
<i>We got the plutonium
with an assist from Roy.</i>

5
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,084
You're working
with the Monitor.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,556
Mar Novu is trying to save worlds,
not destroy them.

7
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:14,849
I didn't want to
believe it.

8
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:18,853
<i>The only way to win
is to accept the inevitable.</i>

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,100
<i>Where the hell are we?</i>

10
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:21,856
We're on Lian Yu.

11
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:28,029
<i>The name of the island
they found me on is Lian Yu.</i>

12
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,449
<i>It's Mandarin
for "purgatory."</i>

13
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,660
<i>Now I understand why.</i>

14
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:38,706
<i>The memories, the pain,
I've never escaped them.</i>

15
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>They're always with me,</i>

16
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,711
<i>a reminder of what I had
to endure</i>

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,090
<i>with only one thought,
one goal...</i>

18
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,175
<i>survive.</i>

19
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:54,389
<i>To save the multiverse,
I must become something else.</i>

20
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,644
<i>To do that, I have to return
to where my journey began...</i>

21
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,438
<i>purgatory.</i>

22
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,822
So this is the famous
Lian Yu.

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,366
I did not
want a return ticket to this place.

24
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,744
The three of you were supposed
to be safe and sound in Star City.

25
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,329
How'd you get here?

26
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,015
A bunch of guys
in tac gear came

27
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,082
and stormed the bunker.

28
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,500
A.R.G.U.S. agents.

29
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,711
Sounds just as fun
as tranq darts.

30
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,629
I'm sorry about that.
I needed you here,

31
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,316
and I didn't have time
to convince you.

32
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:29,567
What the hell's
going on, Lyla?

33
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,151
Mar Novu needs us
to build a weapon,

34
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,615
and it has to be done
on this island.

35
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:34,357
I'm not doing
anything for that guy.

36
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,347
No, we have to.

37
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,329
Since when do
we take orders from the enemy?

38
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,480
We were wrong
about Novu, John.

39
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:45,732
He's not our enemy.

40
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:46,899
Since when?

41
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,610
He dropped me in an alternate reality

42
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,838
in order to teach me the lesson that

43
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:51,988
to fix the multiverse

44
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,073
we need to work
with him.

45
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,783
This is crazy.

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,230
I know it's hard
to hear, Johnny,

47
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,494
but it's the truth.

48
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,038
John...

49
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,374
Um...

50
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,583
how do we build
the weapon?

51
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,379
The materials we need
are already here

52
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:09,714
in the crates outside.

53
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,215
Dr. Wong has been
experimenting

54
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,502
with the dwarf star particles
since leaving Hong Kong.

55
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,219
He's designed schematics
for the build.

56
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,347
Schematics?
Why does that make me think

57
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,673
that this Dr. Wong guy
won't actually build this thing?

58
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,966
We're counting on you
for that.

59
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,810
- Say again?
- The device is powered

60
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:23,978
by plutonium.

61
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,980
Dinah, Roy, and Rene
are on their way here

62
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,315
with samples
from Star City.

63
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,667
So my mission
was part of this?

64
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,401
All of our missions
are a part of this.

65
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,448
With all due respect,

66
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:39,035
what am I doing
back on Lian Yu?

67
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,579
In the past few days,
the island has seen

68
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,872
a rash
of energy spikes.

69
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,208
Is that your reason
for it being green?

70
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,168
Because the last time
that I was here,

71
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,753
Adrian Chase blew it up.

72
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,922
Yes. Harnessing
that energy is the key,

73
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,609
and we need to do it
right away because

74
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,009
we have no idea how long
the energy spikes will last.

75
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,596
Okay. Wait. So we build this
magic weapon for the space god

76
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,515
and we stop Crisis?

77
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,891
There is no stopping Crisis.

78
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,518
Well, then what's
the weapon for?

79
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,852
I don't know,

80
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,272
but Novu said this
is how we survive it,

81
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,440
and I believe him.

82
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,651
If we can't stop Crisis...

83
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,156
Sorry.

84
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,409
What is he
talking about?

85
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,412
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:25,832
Would the group mind
if I had a moment with my kids?

87
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,126
Of course.

88
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,720
There's no easy way
to say this.

89
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,640
Mar Novu has seen my fate.

90
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,393
I don't survive Crisis.

91
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,521
- What do you mean?
- I mean that he told me

92
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,982
what would happen to me
the day that he walked in

93
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,358
and asked for my help.

94
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,527
And when exactly
were you planning on telling us?

95
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,157
I've been fighting my fate
because of the two of you,

96
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,826
and I can't fight it,
I can't change it.

97
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,079
So you're just giving up?

98
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,166
I am attempting to
save the multiverse,

99
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,044
and I'm trying to keep
the two of you safe.

100
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,213
We gotta build the weapon,

101
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,007
and finish this mission,

102
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:19,218
and that's the way
that it has to be.

103
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,972
Well, then I guess
we better get to it.

104
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,776
Lyla, what happened to
no more secrets between us?

105
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,322
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you.

106
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,329
So you thought tranqing me
and bringing me here

107
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,451
of all places was somehow
a better explanation?

108
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,661
Mar Novu made it clear
that silence was

109
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,288
a requirement
of the mission.

110
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:48,992
We couldn't risk interfering

111
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,434
with the journeys
of the other players.

112
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,628
As in Oliver's journey
ending in a death sentence?

113
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,088
What did Novu ask you
to do, Lyla?

114
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,715
He didn't give me
details.

115
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,968
He just told me that
when the time comes

116
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:02,678
I would know
what to do.

117
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,306
You're just fine
with that? Why?

118
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,350
Faith.

119
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,150
You remember that IED
that took out my unit in Afghanistan?

120
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,902
I remember that.
Of course I do.

121
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,029
You were
the only survivor.

122
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,658
Took you years to stop
having nightmares about that blast.

123
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,451
Mar Novu when he
first came to me,

124
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,370
he told me he
rescued me that day

125
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,289
because I have
a greater purpose.

126
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,917
- And you believed him?
- A grown man in costume

127
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,460
prophesizing
the apocalypse?

128
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:35,670
I thought it was
a joke,

129
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,214
but then he came
to me again,

130
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:44,136
and he showed me... us,
our future

131
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:49,684
just wiped away,
gone as if it never existed.

132
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,478
So you made a deal
with him?

133
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,313
We would work together
to find heroes

134
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,023
strong enough
to face this Crisis.

135
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,821
He told me it was the only way
I could protect our family.

136
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,169
Lyla, you may have accepted that this
was the only way to move forward,

137
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,584
but I have not.

138
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,045
I won't.

139
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,475
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
the Black Canary knows how to fly.

140
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,353
Flying's easy.
Landing's the hard part.

141
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,064
Kidding.

142
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,443
There it is...

143
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,653
purgatory.

144
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,031
Looks a little less
bombed out than I remember.

145
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,658
Wow. After everything
I've heard about this place,

146
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,160
I didn't imagine
it to be so...

147
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:50,328
Terrifying?

148
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,787
Beautiful.

149
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,414
Makes sense you'd think so

150
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,917
since apparently
you're moving here.

151
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,084
Maybe not.

152
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,004
This time around,
you are part of a team.

153
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,299
Island team,
do you copy?

154
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,968
We are five miles south
and inbound for landing. Over.

155
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,470
We copy. Island team
will meet you

156
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,221
at the airstrip
to unload. Over.

157
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,349
No wind to speak of.
Looks like we're in

158
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,100
for a relatively
smooth landing.

159
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,147
Hang on. Hang on.
What the hell is that?

160
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:19,857
Something's wrong.

161
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,587
Hey. Is everything
all right up there?

162
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:23,962
<i>We're picking up...</i>

163
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:24,987
<i>something's incoming.</i>

164
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,364
Did she say, "incoming"?

165
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,284
Dinah, are you there?
Can you read me?

166
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,494
Can you read me?

167
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:32,787
Oh, my God.

168
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,831
Brace for
emergency landing.

169
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:36,999
Hold on!

170
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,006
They're not gonna
make it.

171
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,179
- We need to find the crash site.
- I'm working as fast as I can.

172
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,199
I can't get in contact
with Roy, Rene, or Dinah.

173
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,583
Something keeps
blocking my signal.

174
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,851
Not something, someone.
Whoever shot down that plane.

175
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,412
You should have
told us we weren't alone.

176
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,521
I thought we were.

177
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,663
I had A.R.G.U.S. sweep
the entire island.

178
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,525
Okay. I just
got the coordinates,

179
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:05,444
but the plutonium landed
in a different spot.

180
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,988
There's a tracker
in the case,

181
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,794
but it's nowhere
near Rene, Dinah, or Roy.

182
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,092
The people
are the priority.

183
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,836
Well, obviously, but we still need
the plutonium to build the weapon.

184
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,246
All right.
John, let's split up.

185
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,616
I'll run point
on the rescue.

186
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,790
Connor, you're with me.

187
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,250
I'm coming, too.

188
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,918
I called them here.
This is on me.

189
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,021
Whatever
the three of you do, just be careful.

190
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,940
We don't know who these people are
or what they want.

191
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,007
Copy that.

192
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,094
And I guess that
means, what, the three of us,

193
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,430
we are on
nuclear weapon duty?

194
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,681
I'm staying here.

195
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,684
Are you okay
with that?

196
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,520
Someone needs to
protect William.

197
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,688
Gee. Thanks.

198
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:42,982
It's fair.

199
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:45,735
Thank you.

200
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,577
William synced this map
to the plutonium's location.

201
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,245
Gonna get us
close to the case,

202
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:57,913
but the coordinates
won't be exact,

203
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,166
so we're gonna have to
sweep the area.

204
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,585
Well, the sooner
we find it, the better

205
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,254
because I am not
a fan of this island.

206
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:08,424
Yeah? Well, it has
that effect on people.

207
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,011
You know, I, uh...
I never expected

208
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:15,306
to be on a mission
with you like this, you know.

209
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:17,141
I'm glad you're here.

210
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,187
No offense, but shouldn't
this Kodak moment

211
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,230
be with you
and someone else?

212
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,441
- What?
- You and Mia.

213
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,735
Oh. Trying to
give her a little space.

214
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,755
Sure you're not trying
to avoid a difficult conversation?

215
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,423
I'm pretty sure she doesn't
want to talk to me, Laurel.

216
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,949
Oliver, don't be
an idiot, okay?

217
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,203
All that girl wants
to do is live up to her father.

218
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,956
Fine. All this father
wants is to complete this mission

219
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,335
so that my kids actually have
a world to live in.

220
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,838
- We are almost there. Come on.
- Oliver.

221
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,091
Piece of advice.

222
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,134
Don't leave this island
with more regrets

223
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,621
than you already have
buried here.

224
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:02,269
Oh. Building this weapon with
2019 tech may actually kill me.

225
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,771
I miss the future.

226
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,611
What's this?

227
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,281
Those are very volatile
dwarf star particles

228
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,743
that could level
an entire city or island.

229
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,372
All right. What can I do
to help, huh?

230
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,916
Well, do you know how to calculate
the volume of a sphere?

231
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,168
4/3 pi times
radius cubed.

232
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,338
I was raised
by Felicity, too, remember?

233
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,341
Right. Well, do you know what
the Pauli exclusion principle

234
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,509
of quantum physics is?

235
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,094
Didn't pay
that much attention.

236
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,405
Well, then that pretty much
takes you out of the running

237
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,431
of helping me
in any meaningful way.

238
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,351
Damn. I'm gonna need
a wire stripper.

239
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,520
These are the most
complicated coding

240
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,272
and design sequences
I have ever seen,

241
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,315
and I'm including 2040
when I say, "ever."

242
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,991
It's not like you
to hide out in the bunker

243
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,826
and miss out
on all the action.

244
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,871
Still mad at Dad?

245
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,749
It's his life.

246
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,004
He can do whatever
he wants with it, right?

247
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,755
Always has.

248
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,900
You're being a bit
harsh, don't you think?

249
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,760
And you are being a bit chill,
don't you think?

250
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,430
I was right all along.

251
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,767
Yeah. He has always
been a hero first

252
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,269
and a dad second.

253
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,897
We never should have
trusted him.

254
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,192
- Mia.
- I'm getting your wire stripper.

255
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,821
I'm sorry our
first meeting had to be this.

256
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,241
I envisioned getting to know
my future son over a meal,

257
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,202
not en route
to a plane crash.

258
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,080
This... this feels about
right for our family.

259
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,291
Most of our milestones
got interrupted

260
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,458
by some sort of international
emergency or another.

261
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,521
Yeah. I guess your dad and I
weren't really there

262
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,796
for you and JJ.

263
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,341
You were there
when it counted.

264
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,552
Besides, I was
beyond proud to be the son

265
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,013
of the two superspies
that co-founded Knightwatch.

266
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,556
You never mentioned that.

267
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,434
I think maybe
I wasn't supposed to.

268
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,561
Time travel rules
and all.

269
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,730
Have to assume that
the timelines are different now

270
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,233
unless you remember
your mother being in league

271
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,984
with a evil deity.

272
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,403
Mar Novu is not evil.

273
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,949
Our friends' plane got
shot out of the sky, Lyla.

274
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,239
How do you know that
wasn't part of his cosmic plan?

275
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:23,452
And don't say faith.

276
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,247
Because I'm fresh out.

277
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,376
Okay, okay.

278
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,742
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

279
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,504
You guys okay?

280
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:34,672
I think so.

281
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,066
We have no idea
where Roy is.

282
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,591
Okay. You are
definitely not okay.

283
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,218
We cannot let this
get infected.

284
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,946
You guys keep searching.
I'll take Rene back

285
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,930
- and get him fixed up.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

286
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,974
- We need to find Roy.
- Where? Where?

287
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,308
This way.

288
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,438
Laurel, I found it!

289
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,485
Laurel!

290
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,787
- Let her go.
- I'm afraid he can't do that.

291
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,168
Hello, Oliver.

292
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,170
Fyers.

293
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,274
- You're dead.
- What?

294
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,676
Seems I've been given
a new lease on life,

295
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,429
though this time I'll
be sure to finish the job.

296
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,358
Drop your weapon.

297
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,363
Drop... your weapon!

298
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,422
Friends of yours?

299
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,549
Edward Fyers
and Billy Wintergreen.

300
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,718
They were on the island
when I first got here,

301
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,803
and they're both dead.

302
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,222
So now we're fighting ghosts?
How is that even possible?

303
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,516
- Get this to William.
- Where are you going?

304
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,684
I have to go
after Fyers.

305
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,102
Or you come with me,

306
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,395
and we finish
this weapon

307
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,606
and get the hell
off this nightmare island.

308
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:16,899
Fyers is my mess.

309
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,901
He's a mercenary
that I fought and I killed.

310
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,152
He clearly wants revenge,

311
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,780
and ma... makes him
my responsibility.

312
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,172
All right. I'll be
back as soon as I can.

313
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,059
Yao Fei?

314
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,112
- Are you real?
- As real as the men you hunt.

315
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,613
Why'd you try to shoot me?

316
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,948
Like the first time.

317
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,699
To keep you from danger.

318
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,035
No one can keep me from danger,
okay, not even you.

319
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,453
Because you are
fated to die?

320
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,747
There are forces at play

321
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,457
that want you to not succeed.

322
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,019
Fyers and his men know
about the weapon,

323
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,563
and they want to use
it for themselves.

324
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,424
All right. Well, who else
has, um, returned?

325
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,717
Only those who were
with you from the beginning,

326
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,762
but you must not let the evil
that tempted you at the start

327
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,848
distract you
at the end.

328
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,767
He's coming after more than my mission,
Yao Fei, you understand?

329
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,094
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

330
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:38,564
Last time you tried
to do alone did not end well.

331
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,441
I'm not that person
anymore.

332
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,193
I will hope.

333
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,612
- Roy!
- Roy!

334
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,282
Roy!

335
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,287
There!

336
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,165
Roy!

337
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,917
I can't...
I can't move!

338
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,271
Roy, we're gonna
get you out of here.

339
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,296
His arm is pinned.

340
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,548
- Can you feel anything?
- No, no.

341
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,429
We got a problem.
Fuel.

342
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,490
- Okay.
- We got to get him out of here

343
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,765
before this
whole thing blows.

344
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,410
Let's get this off
of him, okay?

345
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,186
- Yeah.
- One, two, three, lift!

346
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,858
How bad is it?

347
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:24,902
Tell me!

348
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,528
Your arm
is crushed.

349
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,156
If you can't feel it,
then that means pretty badly.

350
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,408
If we can't move
what is pinning you,

351
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,857
then we need to start
thinking about other contingencies.

352
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,472
What are we
talking about here?

353
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,663
We don't have
much time.

354
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,749
The best way to get
Roy out

355
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,168
might be amputation.

356
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,920
- What?
- Can you do that?

357
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,314
I have a med kit
in my pack back there.

358
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,339
It'll have what I need.

359
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,341
If we can just move
this off of him, okay,

360
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,718
we have a chance
at saving his arm.

361
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,205
I mean, the odds
aren't very good.

362
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,501
We owe it to him
to keep trying!

363
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,324
So let's move this
thing, all right?

364
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,349
Let's go!

365
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,172
- Dinah.
- I'm gonna check it out.

366
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,856
Yeah. All right. Look.
Let's try to find a lever

367
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,442
to help get this
off of him, okay?

368
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,237
Roy, just hang tight.
We'll be right back.

369
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,119
Oh, good.
You're not dead.

370
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,249
Or maybe I spoke
too soon.

371
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,751
Rene is injured
but okay.

372
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,045
Roy's in a bad spot.

373
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,439
Well, we're all gonna be
there with him

374
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,623
if... if we don't
keep moving.

375
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,884
Sounds like you found the guys
who shot down our plane.

376
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,553
Oliver's old island enemies.

377
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,363
They've been dead
for the last 12 years.

378
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,682
Of course they have.

379
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,642
Where is Oliver?

380
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,394
He went after them,

381
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,647
made me the radioactive
material mule.

382
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,898
Let's go.

383
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,819
1, 2, 3!

384
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:56,678
It's got to be
caught on something,

385
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:59,182
- a root system or something.
- All right. Then we dig him out.

386
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,515
- We dig him out.
- We have to hurry.

387
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,082
Guys, we're about
to have company

388
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,935
- and not the good kind.
- We can hold them off!

389
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,687
The fuel's about to spark, John.
We don't have time.

390
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:06,837
We can trench
it, Dinah!

391
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,190
- Dad, we are out of options!
- We are not out of options!

392
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,067
- I don't accept that!
- We don't have a choice!

393
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,384
We always have
a choice, Connor.

394
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,802
Then I'll make it.

395
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,889
Do it.
Just cut me free.

396
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,018
No. No, Roy.

397
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,104
John, it's better
my arm than our lives.

398
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,111
Get the kit.
Get the kit.

399
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,073
Laurel and I will
distract them.

400
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,783
Here. You apply
the tourniquet.

401
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,951
I'll get ready.

402
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,748
Just hold on, okay?
Just hold on.

403
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,297
Okay.

404
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,303
- This will be over fast.
- Am I gonna feel it?

405
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,388
Probably.

406
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,099
I'm with you, Roy.
I'm with you, okay?

407
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,726
You ready?

408
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:04,770
Do it!

409
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,356
Hyah!

410
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,445
Fyers' camp is just up ahead.

411
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:14,780
We should not
be back here.

412
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,406
You don't have to
help, Yao Fei.

413
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,824
I help for Shado.

414
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,286
I'm sorry
I couldn't save her.

415
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,289
You know the bond now
between a father and child.

416
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,625
I do. It's exactly why
I have to put Fyers down.

417
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,293
Should be right
up here.

418
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,129
They're gone.

419
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,440
Okay. That doesn't
make any sense.

420
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,507
He should be here.

421
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,019
Fyers knew
you'd come here.

422
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,788
Well, now he's free and clear
to attack my friends and my family.

423
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,232
We need to get
out of here.

424
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,650
How?

425
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,361
Use your bow?

426
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,239
It's pinned.

427
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,660
All right. Well, we will
have to cut our way out.

428
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,829
The net is made
of braided steel.

429
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,956
- That blade won't cut.
- It'll cut.

430
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,292
- Ohh!
- Gotchu, gotchu, easy. Shh.

431
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:12,713
What the hell happened?

432
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,607
His arm got pinned
underneath the landing gear.

433
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:15,632
We had to amputate.

434
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,319
I'm sure you did
what you needed to do.

435
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,052
- Roy?
- William.

436
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,364
Not sure it's really
a good time for a meet and greet.

437
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,389
Is Oliver back yet?

438
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,117
We thought
he was with you.

439
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,781
No. He went after
the bad guys on his own.

440
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,978
- Why would you let him do that?
- Seriously?

441
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,396
Okay. We have to
go after him.

442
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,898
No. No. William
has to finish the weapon.

443
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,265
I don't care
about your weapon!

444
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,712
Oliver knows this island
better than anyone, Mia. He'll be fine.

445
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,612
Plus it's smarter
for us to stick together.

446
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,656
No. We are not leaving
him out there.

447
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,158
Mia!

448
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,577
Fine. I'll go on my own!

449
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,807
- This is a bad idea.
- Then don't come with me.

450
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,791
You heard Laurel.
We should stick together.

451
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,853
- It's smarter tactically.
- Are you really gonna lecture me

452
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,003
on tactics right now?

453
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,213
Well... no, but...

454
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,799
Dig is right.

455
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,135
I mean, Dad and this island,
they go way back,

456
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,782
and he knows every
inch of this place.

457
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,648
You going out there
could make things worse.

458
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:04,890
I'll take my chances.

459
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,017
Get out of my way.

460
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:09,686
William.

461
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,524
Look. It is okay for you
to be afraid of losing him

462
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,985
especially after the way
that you left things.

463
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,752
You don't know what
you're talking about.

464
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,572
This is exactly what
happened with Felicity.

465
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,384
You were angry with her,
but you still wanted to save her.

466
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,911
I'm not just gonna
sit here and do nothing, okay?

467
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,747
I will not leave him
alone out there. I...

468
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,001
I will not... let him die.

469
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,214
I let myself believe for just...

470
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,717
just a minute that
I could actually have my dad.

471
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,097
Look. When I was a kid,
I spent a lot of time pushing him away

472
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,684
because I never thought
that I could lose him,

473
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:51,895
and then he disappeared.

474
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,647
Yeah. Now we might
lose him again.

475
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,899
How are you so
calm about this?

476
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,235
I'm not,
but when I was little,

477
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,945
Felicity had me down
in that bunker

478
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,613
watching Dad
out in the field,

479
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,907
and I saw that he could
cheat death more than anyone,

480
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,743
but if this really is the end,

481
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:12,040
I don't want to waste the time
that I have left with him being angry.

482
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,751
Do you?

483
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,759
I was wrong.
You haven't changed.

484
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,636
Still that impatient
boy I found.

485
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,322
You realize that
insulting me is not gonna

486
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,722
make this go
any faster, right?

487
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:31,184
Breathe. Remember
in everything, breathe.

488
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:35,355
I'm trying to cut my way out of a net,
Yao Fei, not shoot an arrow.

489
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,899
We wouldn't be
in this net if you had breathed.

490
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,360
You know what Fyers
is capable of, right?

491
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,070
I need to get back
to my family,

492
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,530
and I'm running
out of time.

493
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,156
You could be
with your family,

494
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,658
but you chose here
instead.

495
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,910
I chose to protect them.

496
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,746
You avoid them
because you're fated to die.

497
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,791
I've been fighting
that fate for a long time.

498
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,211
I've accepted it.

499
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,630
That hasn't made things
any easier.

500
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,883
What am I supposed to say
to my kids?

501
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,384
What I could not
to Shado.

502
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,345
You say good-bye.

503
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,140
I don't think
that I can.

504
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:16,021
My kids have spent
basically

505
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,898
their entire lives
without me.

506
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,612
And they're about to
have to do it all over again.

507
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,280
You think you
have failed.

508
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:29,284
The first thing that you
taught me<i>... shengcun</i>, survive.

509
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,996
Well, I can't do
that anymore.

510
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,915
<i>Shengcun</i> is more
than body.

511
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,752
It is spirit,
what lives on,

512
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,295
like I did in Shado,

513
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,297
like she does in you.

514
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,716
That is survive.

515
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,093
How do I do that?

516
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,553
You live now

517
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,014
with your children

518
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,767
with the time
you have left.

519
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,272
I need to get out
of this net first.

520
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,775
Always have patience.

521
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,075
Like I said,
patience.

522
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,378
Just came by to check on you.
How you feeling?

523
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,588
I... I've been better.

524
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,553
I'm so sorry, Roy.

525
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,020
I should have found
another way to get you out.

526
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,267
This wasn't your fault.

527
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,479
Yeah. Well, that's
where you're wrong.

528
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,585
I mean, you wouldn't even
be in this situation

529
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,444
if I hadn't come to
find you in Hub City.

530
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,911
Roy... I can't protect
the people I care about.

531
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,998
You know I worked with you
and Oliver for a really long time,

532
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,502
and if I've learned anything,
it's that this team

533
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,879
has each other's backs
no matter the cost.

534
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,174
Things just didn't exactly
go as planned.

535
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:09,843
That's an understatement.

536
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,636
No, but I would
rather be here.

537
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,848
I would rather be here
with you

538
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,017
and with the team
than back in Hub City,

539
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,309
living a life all alone.

540
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,732
Heroes make
sacrifices, John,

541
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,401
and for better
or for worse,

542
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,486
this just had to be mine.

543
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,956
John... we got
a problem.

544
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,803
Fyers and his men
have surrounded the camp.

545
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,209
We can expect an attack
any minute.

546
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,776
How long before
the weapon is ready?

547
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,480
I'm done building it.
Once the plutonium finishes

548
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,214
transferring the energy,
I can turn it on.

549
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:51,134
- How long will that take?
- I'm not sure.

550
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,195
Can we take this
to a safer part of the island

551
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,947
- and finish it there?
- No, no. It has to be here.

552
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,574
I've tapped into the center of
the island's energy.

553
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,349
- We can't move.
- And it has to be tonight.

554
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,161
We don't know when
the next energy spike will be,

555
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,305
and we can't afford to wait.

556
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,188
We need to
buy William more time.

557
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,025
Dad, you're okay.

558
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,070
Yeah. An old friend
steered me back.

559
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,362
I'm sorry that
I took off.

560
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,541
I should have been here
with the two of you.

561
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,657
You're here now.

562
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,702
How are we
supposed to beat an army of ghosts?

563
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,038
Power up the device.

564
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,877
The sphere's absorbing
the energy of the island,

565
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:26,077
and if that's what brought these dead
people back to life in the first place...

566
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,630
Activating the device
will destroy them.

567
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,590
We're talking
about plutonium here.

568
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,133
That's nasty stuff.
It can take out

569
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,885
this entire island,
us included!

570
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,905
If this is our best chance
of surviving the Crisis,

571
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,089
then we need to
take the risk.

572
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,390
Lyla's right.
She's right.

573
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,643
This is it.

574
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,436
This is our best shot.

575
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,315
Suit up.

576
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,536
You are as foolish
as ever, Queen.

577
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,246
Surrender!

578
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,166
I suppose that means
you're not here to surrender to me.

579
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,001
I'm the one who
killed you, Fyers.

580
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,337
I'm very pleased
to return the favor,

581
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,132
a task you've made
much easier by coming alone.

582
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:13,758
I'm not alone.

583
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,503
Now that the plutonium
has transferred the energy,

584
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:35,321
all I have to do is
power it on,

585
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:36,906
and voila!

586
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,661
It doesn't look on.

587
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,955
- Why isn't it working?
- I have no idea.

588
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,250
It doesn't matter
how many people you have.

589
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,085
The outcome
is the same.

590
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,087
Kill them!

591
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:57,903
William, we're running
out of time.

592
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,220
Okay. I think
I have something.

593
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:00,987
There was a double helix
genetic sequence

594
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,223
in Dr. Wong's formula.

595
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,435
I thought it was an error, but now
I think the device can only be powered on

596
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,312
using a specific DNA code.

597
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,777
Oliver. Oliver,
we need you back here

598
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,237
to activate the device.

599
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,032
Oliver,
you got to go!

600
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,287
Yao Fei, if this works...

601
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,082
We will part again,
but the dead are never really gone.

602
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,127
I've got your six.

603
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,481
They're not gonna be
able to hold them off much longer.

604
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,274
- We need to hurry.
- The sphere is touch-activated.

605
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,098
It'll turn on the moment you
pick it up and...

606
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,699
I don't know what
happens after that.

607
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,720
Okay.

608
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:32,021
Wow. That was anticlimactic.

609
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,315
- What the hell?
- What? What is it?

610
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,110
Dad's DNA doesn't match
the algorithm's specified sequence.

611
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,421
- Does that mean we can't turn it on?
<i>- Sequence match.</i>

612
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,697
You can't...

613
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,241
but she can.

614
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:46,244
What are you talking about?

615
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,246
The DNA sequence isn't Dad's.

616
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,081
It's yours.

617
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,753
Is it me,
or is this not going well?

618
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,173
We gotta buy
them some time.

619
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,512
God, I hate this island!

620
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:05,972
Might as well go out
with a bang.

621
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:12,061
I thought this weapon was
supposed to help us survive Crisis.

622
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,813
That's what Novu
told me.

623
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,553
Does this mean
you're the weapon?

624
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,736
Johnny...

625
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,740
I understand why
you have to do this.

626
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,948
Lyla, are you all right?

627
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:07,742
I have to go.

628
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,186
Hey, guys.
I just, uh...

629
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,538
I just connected
with A.R.G.U.S.,

630
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,481
and Lyla organized
a rescue boat

631
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,233
before everything
happened.

632
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,901
Should be here
any minute, so...

633
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:44,654
so we're all
going home.

634
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,826
Did Mom... did she know
what was gonna happen to her?

635
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,537
No. No. She was
just as surprised as the rest of us.

636
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,539
Novu just loves
surprises, doesn't he?

637
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,916
Whatever Mar Novu
has planned for Lyla,

638
00:31:58,668 --> 00:31:59,669
she can handle it.

639
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,629
How much time
do we have

640
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,090
before the Crisis?

641
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,801
Not long.

642
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,722
Should, um, probably
finish packing

643
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,142
before the boat
arrives.

644
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,853
Agreed. No more
island vacations.

645
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,940
Uh, hey, guys.

646
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,986
Listen. I just wanted to...

647
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,698
I wanted to thank
both of you

648
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,742
for just being there for me
no matter what.

649
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,745
Why does this sound
like a good-bye speech?

650
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,373
Pass. Do not accept.

651
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,585
This ain't over
till it's over, Oliver.

652
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,336
All right.

653
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,088
Come on.

654
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:02,648
Hey.

655
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,403
I don't really know
what to say.

656
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,064
I'm really happy
that you're back with the team, and...

657
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:12,450
I'm really sorry.

658
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,952
I'll be okay.

659
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,747
Plus Dig's gonna
set me up with

660
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,634
one of those fancy
A.R.G.U.S. doctors, so...

661
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,145
Uh, the boat's
almost ready.

662
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,919
Uh, we good down here?

663
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,128
Yeah. We should go.

664
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,173
Oh. Uh, almost forgot.

665
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,511
This is what led me here
in the future

666
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,890
to you and, uh,
to the team.

667
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:37,882
Thought you might
like it back.

668
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:41,187
I don't need it.

669
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,732
Plus I think it should
stay in the family.

670
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,007
You know, when Felicity
gave this to me,

671
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,950
she told me it was
a symbol of reconnection.

672
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,036
- She was right.
- She normally is.

673
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,541
No. You keep it.

674
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,585
William, what you
were able to do,

675
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,629
you're a hero.

676
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,716
Well, I had
a pretty good example.

677
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,219
It means a lot to me

678
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,429
that I've had a chance to...

679
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,683
to see the type of man
you've become.

680
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,018
I hope you'll forgive me

681
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:24,522
for lots of things
eventually.

682
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:26,691
Dad, I already have.

683
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,569
I mean, I know for you
I only left a year ago.

684
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,487
For me, it's been
20 years,

685
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,355
and back then
when I was a kid,

686
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,867
I didn't understand
what it meant

687
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,495
to fight for something
bigger than yourself,

688
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:40,997
but now I do.

689
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,292
I'm really proud of you, Dad.

690
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,335
Not as proud
as I am of you.

691
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,465
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- You better.

692
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:52,633
Okay.

693
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,650
Thinking about
where Lyla went?

694
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,153
Can't think
about anything else.

695
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,950
I know this is a sacrifice
she has to make

696
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,410
for the multiverse.

697
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:22,663
I feel like I'm always
asking you favors.

698
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,498
Anything you need,
Oliver, always.

699
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,419
I need those kids
back in 2040

700
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:33,424
somehow, some way before
whatever's gonna happen happens.

701
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,231
Yeah. I was thinking
about the same thing.

702
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,927
I'll make sure they
get home safe.

703
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,014
One more thing.

704
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:41,641
When this is over,

705
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,226
track down Felicity and...

706
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,480
just tell her that
I don't want...

707
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:53,194
Mia and William
kept separated.

708
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,490
I think that they deserve
to grow up with each other.

709
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:00,618
I'll tell her.

710
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:01,952
Yeah.

711
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,956
You know, Oliver,
I once told you a long time ago

712
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,752
that uh, a soldier never lets
a brother go into battle alone.

713
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,675
I think that's why it was so hard
for me to accept the idea that...

714
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,094
you weren't gonna
make it out of this.

715
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,389
I felt like I'd be
failing you.

716
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:24,934
You could never
fail me, John.

717
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,689
I'm gonna stick
by your side

718
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:30,898
for as long
as I can,

719
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,609
but I know you
have to do this alone.

720
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,279
Every mission
has an end.

721
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:39,573
I wish this one didn't.

722
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,829
I couldn't have done
any of this,

723
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,375
any of it
without you.

724
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,461
You've always been
my rock.

725
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,231
Don't mean the best man
you've ever known?

726
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,548
I also mean that.

727
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,061
Hey, let's get out of here, man.

728
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,497
Don't want to keep
the boat waiting.

729
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:11,731
I'll be right behind you.

730
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:13,274
One more thing
I got to do.

731
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:34,628
Hey.

732
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,005
Hey.

733
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,007
Um, William said I might
find you here.

734
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,593
Figured you'd be
the first one on the boat.

735
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:44,930
You okay?

736
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:52,188
My whole life I heard nothing
but stories about you.

737
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,275
You know, this legendary
Green Arrow and his team.

738
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,112
I should have been
proud of you

739
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,575
because you were
a hero, and...

740
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:08,245
all I could see
is that that is

741
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:09,812
the reason that
you weren't with me,

742
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:14,543
and it's... it's kind of
hard to let that go.

743
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:19,423
I never meant to cause
you any pain.

744
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,345
Your mom and me just
wanted to protect you.

745
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:25,763
I know.

746
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,766
I, uh... I understand
that now.

747
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,772
For a very long time,

748
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,358
I have hated this place.

749
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,361
Just, I'd think about all the people
that it took from me.

750
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:44,323
It would just... it would just
make me so angry.

751
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:47,993
But you're not now?

752
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,328
I'm still a little bit angry.

753
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,999
This island taught me
to survive.

754
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,961
It turned me
into someone else,

755
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,631
somebody better than
the person I was before.

756
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,595
So despite my feelings...

757
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,976
there are no stories
about the Green Arrow to tell

758
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,729
if I don't make my way
to Lian Yu,

759
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,983
and I'm also not standing
at this moment

760
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,027
looking at my daughter.

761
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,573
Thank you for letting me
be a part of your story

762
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,827
even if it was only
for a little while.

763
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,999
Mia, something tells me
you're gonna create your own stories.

764
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,221
So what now?

765
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:50,848
We need to get back home

766
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,476
and just be prepared

767
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,562
for whatever's
coming next.

768
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:57,897
Okay.

769
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,991
Dad.

770
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,252
- Lyla?
- Not anymore.

771
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:24,131
I'm now a harbinger
of things to come.

772
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,966
- And that's...
- Yes.

773
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,761
The Crisis has begun.

774
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,441
For so many years,

775
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,194
I've traveled across worlds,

776
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,949
across the multiverse
to do one thing...

777
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:51,700
kill you,

778
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:57,414
and now here,
you save my life.

779
00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:01,502
<i>Submit and
begin your life anew.</i>

780
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:03,921
Show me.

781
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:07,257
<i>The knowledge is within you.</i>

782
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,085
Greg, move your head!
