1
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:03,296
<i>Previously on "Arrow"...</i>

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,923
H-how is this real?

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,342
- This is Novu?
- How do we stop a god?

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:08,551
I'm working on it.

5
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:11,930
Hello, bunker!
So why'd you call in the big guns?

6
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,682
Earth-2 was destroyed
by a wave of energy.

7
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,519
So it's probably powerful
enough to stop a god.

8
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,562
- Yes, Curtis?
- Whatever it is, it is

9
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,439
possible to replicate,
but there's a catch.

10
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:24,067
It is super illegal
because it requires plutonium.

11
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,794
<i>Luckily, there's a guy,
a military general.</i>

12
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,320
- Ok. Where is he?
- Russia.

13
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:28,655
You can bring back
my Earth?

14
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,240
The recovery
of your universe

15
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,575
will require
a single task.

16
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:35,078
You must betray
Oliver Queen.

17
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:44,462
So that's the secret?
A tennis ball.

18
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,214
You know how you use
a honing steel

19
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,007
to keep the edge
on a chef's knife?

20
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,175
I don't really cook.

21
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,802
That makes sense.

22
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,220
All right.

23
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,805
This keeps you sharp.

24
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:58,226
Only a direct, precise
hit will pin the ball.

25
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,270
If you are off just
a little bit...

26
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,150
it deflects.

27
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:08,695
Ready?

28
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:09,862
Toss it.

29
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,805
Thought this was
supposed to be hard.

30
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,080
This is the warm-up.

31
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,459
Ready.

32
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,298
So specialty arrows,

33
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,198
and each one has
a specific purpose.

34
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,467
What does this one do?

35
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,595
Explosive arrow,
lighter payload,

36
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,305
meant to divert and disable.

37
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,819
<i>Acidic arrow,
meant to breach covertly</i>

38
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,279
<i>or weaken structurally.</i>

39
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,457
<i>Bolo arrow...
to secure and subdue.</i>

40
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,125
<i>These are just tools.</i>

41
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,545
<i>If you rely on them too
much, they become crutches.</i>

42
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:09,714
Then why have them?

43
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,133
To get out of a fight

44
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,345
or to end one before
it begins.

45
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:32,779
Not bad.

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,781
So what's next?

47
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,669
Hyah!

48
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,504
Nyssa taught you well.

49
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,963
Mom made sure of it.

50
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,179
How did you do that?

51
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,347
Variable acceleration.

52
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,349
All right?
It's all about timing.

53
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:03,476
You keep practicing,
you keep flowing,

54
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,803
it just becomes
second nature.

55
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,688
All right. Again.

56
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,314
You don't want
a break maybe?

57
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,234
She's a machine, Dad.
They don't need breaks.

58
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,212
And speaking of machines,
I have something to show you guys.

59
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,237
I created

60
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:15,988
a facial recognition
algorithm

61
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,995
to find that general
that Curtis told us about,

62
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,201
which was a lot harder
than it sounds,

63
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,036
because no offense to
Felicity,

64
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,203
but these computers are,
like, a million years old.

65
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,748
And Russia is
a very big country.

66
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,500
- William.
- Right. Sorry.

67
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,044
His name is
General Alexi Burov,

68
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,337
and he's in Moscow.

69
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,880
Curtis said that

70
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,674
the energy wave
that destroyed Earth-2

71
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,968
can be replicated, which
means we can weaponize it.

72
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,740
And right before he went
off the grid,

73
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,805
Burov was working on plans
for a weapon called

74
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,182
the pulse wave generator.

75
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,726
All right.
We need those plans.

76
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,519
We also need plutonium.

77
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,539
It's the only thing that
can power Burov's machine.

78
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,065
Wait. Plutonium as in
a nuclear bomb?

79
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,025
- Mm-hmm.
- Where are we gonna get that?

80
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,653
Bialya. There's
a facility near the border

81
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,448
where all kinds of
radioactive material is stored.

82
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,176
I'm thinking a two-man fire team
can get the job done.

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,994
- Okay. Want to take Connor?
- No, no.

84
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,954
Actually, he wanted to check in on Sandra.

85
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,598
And he promised to stay out of sight.

86
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:07,933
I have someone else in mind to help.

87
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,709
Okay. I'd like the two of you

88
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,753
to accompany me
and Laurel to Russia.

89
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,297
Okay?

90
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,506
Yeah.

91
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,216
Okay. We'll wheels up
at dawn.

92
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:18,885
Well, better go buy a parka.

93
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,387
Is it really that cold in Russia?

94
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,639
Oh, oh! You are so
not ready for this.

95
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,895
Things seem to be going
pretty well with the kids.

96
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,339
Never thought I'd
get to know them.

97
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:32,607
Not like this.

98
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:34,209
Is that why you invited
them to go with you?

99
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,777
Well, I mean, I promised Mia

100
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,653
that I would keep training her.

101
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,740
And I think it's very valuable
for them to keep seeing

102
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,700
how we operate in the field.

103
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,012
And you're sure Russia's
a good place for a tutorial, Oliver?

104
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,954
That was a very dark time for you.

105
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,706
It was a long time ago, though.

106
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,543
I'm a better man.
I'm a different man.

107
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,688
I think that I can teach them good

108
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,130
without showing them the bad.

109
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,760
Hope so.

110
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,687
What the hell are you
doing here?

111
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,481
Our mutual friend
sent me.

112
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,611
You're working with
the Monitor. Why?

113
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,154
- It's complicated.
- Really?

114
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,948
Because he destroyed my entire Earth.

115
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,714
That seems pretty straightforward to me.

116
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,784
He didn't.

117
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:26,688
Mar Novu is trying
to save worlds,

118
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,870
not destroy them.

119
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,456
All that stuff
about grief,

120
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,626
you pretending like you
were trying to help me.

121
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:34,877
I should've known better.

122
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,212
I wasn't pretending.

123
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,037
It's a little hard to believe,
Lyla, after all the lying.

124
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,718
It doesn't matter
what you believe.

125
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,930
You're here just
the same as I am.

126
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,308
Now, do you want to get
your Earth back or not?

127
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,182
What does he want me to do?

128
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,729
Oliver's going to Russia

129
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,023
to retrieve plans
to build a weapon.

130
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,898
You need to get
them first.

131
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,735
I thought Oliver was
your friend.

132
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,280
He is, but this is
bigger than him,

133
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,489
bigger than any of us.

134
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,409
Well, whatever the Monitor
offered you must be

135
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,336
really something for you
to be able to betray

136
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,912
everyone that you
care about.

137
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,457
I am doing this for
them, to protect them.

138
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,086
Are you going
to help me?

139
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,881
Yeah.

140
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,048
I will.

141
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,592
Contact me when
it's done.

142
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,970
And here I thought I was
supposed to be the bad guy.

143
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:36,606
Help you?

144
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,149
Yeah. I was looking
for Jason.

145
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,277
Yo, Jason!
You got a visitor.

146
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,240
How you doing, Jason?

147
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,160
<i>How'd you find me?</i>

148
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,579
Oliver's son...
William. He found you.

149
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,207
Oliver's son.
Isn't he, like, 13?

150
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,004
Heh! Yeah, well,
it's a long story.

151
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,815
I have a feeling you
didn't come all this way

152
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,257
just to catch me
up to speed.

153
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,052
I didn't. I need
your help, Roy.

154
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,013
Whatever you're about
to ask me to do, I can't. I'm sorry.

155
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,699
You haven't even heard
what I have to say, man.

156
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:13,643
'Cause I don't need to.
You know what I did.

157
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,437
I'm not a hero
anymore, John,

158
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,148
not with my condition.

159
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,715
So you're just gonna
walk out on me,

160
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,526
same way you did Thea?

161
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,694
No.

162
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,423
Thea told Oliver that you left, man,
without even saying good-bye.

163
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:29,241
It was for the best
for the both of us.

164
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,702
I needed a fresh start,
which is what I'm doing now.

165
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,246
Ok, it was...

166
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:36,457
it was good to see
you, John.

167
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,793
Roy...

168
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,711
look, man,

169
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,175
I know earlier this year
was a struggle for you,

170
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,549
but this crisis is
a threat that's bigger

171
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,343
than anything we've
ever faced.

172
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,765
I wouldn't be here, man,
if we did not need you.

173
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:58,396
If I decide to help you,
it'll be a one-time thing.

174
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,647
That's all I'm asking.

175
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,596
I hope you don't mind,
but, uh...

176
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,697
I brought you
a change of clothes.

177
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,289
So this is
Russia.

178
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,125
Not what you
were expecting?

179
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,877
I just thought
there'd be a lot less dirt.

180
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:25,214
Is very rude to insult
man's homeland.

181
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,341
Hello, Anatoly.

182
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,305
Oliver Queen...

183
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,267
my brother.

184
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,519
Oh, you think maybe
I punch you again?

185
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,979
Never even
crossed my mind.

186
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:44,734
Welcome to Russia,
my favorite American.

187
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,659
Now, I have seen some
very crazy things in my life,

188
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:57,496
but adult children of
Oliver Queen sitting in my bar.

189
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,124
I hope you do not
think badly of me.

190
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,293
Last time we met,
you were little,

191
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,379
and I was on wrong
side of history.

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,966
I like this one already.

193
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,093
I was surprised to learn
that you were in Russia.

194
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,280
I thought the Maldives
would be permanent.

195
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,723
Oh, with Diaz dead,
so reason to stay away.

196
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,016
You got bored.

197
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:18,768
I miss borscht.

198
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,271
So I reinvent myself.
Bar owner. Hm.

199
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,439
But I got inspired, too.

200
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:25,691
I got really good
recipe for piña colada.

201
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,058
You should try.
It's delicious.

202
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,712
Who wouldn't want to be
reminded of the tropics

203
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,821
in these cold
Russian winters?

204
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,698
Well, apparently,
his customers.

205
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,056
Nice to see this one's
still charmer.

206
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,620
How's the search
going for General Burov?

207
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,038
Well, it's not
very easy.

208
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:41,957
But I do have
friends I can call.

209
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,794
I know, but I... I don't
want them involved in this.

210
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,504
Why not?

211
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,356
If he has friends that
can help, it...

212
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,715
Because, Mia,
with due respect,

213
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,009
the people that Anatoly
is describing...

214
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,429
aren't really friends.

215
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,526
Let's just keep this one
in the family, ok?

216
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:58,974
All right.

217
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,144
I work to find Burov
hard way.

218
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,629
You really think
an energy weapon's

219
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,113
gonna stop this
Monitor guy?

220
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:13,739
Yeah well, that's the hope.

221
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,909
Why this place?

222
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,204
The military stores all
its excess plutonium here.

223
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,124
The problem is it's
impenetrable.

224
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,669
Which is why you
asked me to come.

225
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,964
You need a B and E expert
to get inside?

226
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,259
Yeah. Well, actually, it's
more of a smash and grab.

227
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,053
There's a shipment
coming in tonight.

228
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,431
We are gonna steal
the plutonium

229
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,892
before it gets inside.

230
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,060
Go. Go. Go.

231
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,022
Why not bring
Dinah or Rene?

232
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,066
They have their hands full
in Star City.

233
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,946
Must be weird, right?

234
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,115
Oliver meeting
his future son.

235
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,869
Yeah. Well, he's not
the only one.

236
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,332
In the future, I adopt
Ben Turner's son, Connor.

237
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:09,503
He's an agent in
Knightwatch,

238
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:11,839
future version of
A.R.G.U.S.

239
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,401
Well, it sounds like he would've
been a great candidate

240
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,467
for this mission.

241
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,888
You didn't need me
for this, John.

242
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,432
So what are we really
doing here?

243
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,483
You said you wanted
to atone.

244
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,986
Well, you can't do that
by fixing cars.

245
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,197
You do that by
rejoining the team.

246
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,366
I know you think you can't
control your bloodlust.

247
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,928
That's only because you haven't
figured out a way that works.

248
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,495
Because there is no way.

249
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,153
So whatever you're
about to say,

250
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,457
I don't want to hear it.

251
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,127
Look, we're already here,
so I'm gonna help you.

252
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,340
But once we're done,
I'm going to disappear

253
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,426
to a place where even
William can't find me.

254
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,227
I have classic
bad news/good news.

255
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,437
I find general Burov.

256
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,732
Is that the bad news?
I'm confused about the order.

257
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,859
Bad news is, is
he is man who likes betting

258
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:17,238
and blood, which means
only place to find him,

259
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,323
<i>Krovavaya Banya.</i>

260
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,866
"The Bloodbath."

261
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,952
Oh. Heh. Doesn't
that sound lovely?

262
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,537
It's not lovely.
It's a fight club.

263
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,499
Oh. That sounds
like where I met her.

264
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,919
He met you where?

265
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,206
Well, when I
first left home,

266
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,574
I had to find a way
to make money.

267
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,132
So I fought, and I won.

268
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,344
Like father, like daughter,
eh, <i>tovarisch</i>?

269
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,931
You, me, and Laurel

270
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:45,641
will go to the club
to find Burov.

271
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,644
You two are gonna
stay here.

272
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,479
Did you not hear
what I just said?

273
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,064
I grew up in fight clubs.

274
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,565
You did not grow up
in fight clubs

275
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,812
that were run
by the Bratva.

276
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,461
Then why did you bring
us on this mission

277
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,725
if you're not
gonna let us help?

278
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,281
This is not a regular mission.
This is the Bratva.

279
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,492
They are terrible people,
and you guys are my kids.

280
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,779
Yes, but we're not children.

281
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,537
Well, you are when
I look at you.

282
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,920
And I'm sorry, but this is
how it's gonna be.

283
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,548
Okay.

284
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,647
So this is what
the Russians do for fun.

285
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,082
I assume that we want to have
our chat with the general

286
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,607
without crossing
the Bratva.

287
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,152
We want to move quickly
and keep our heads low.

288
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,320
There is General.

289
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,164
Damn it. So boring.

290
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,707
General Burov...

291
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,212
I am Anatoly Knyazev,
Danik's friend.

292
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,922
Danik has
big mouth.

293
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,507
What do you want?

294
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:01,759
Your expertise...

295
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,219
with something sensitive.

296
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,307
Lucky for you,
this fight is boring.

297
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,100
Let us go talk.

298
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,700
I abandoned this
pulse wave generator project.

299
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,578
Too unpredictable,
bad business.

300
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:30,954
So...

301
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,707
why should I give
to you,

302
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,959
Kapiushon?

303
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:41,090
Maybe you should've kept
your secret identity secret?

304
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,004
So this means that

305
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:46,261
you won't be giving
us the plans willingly.

306
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,306
No need for unpleasantness.
I am willing to make deal.

307
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,974
Good. What do you want?

308
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:52,810
A fighter,

309
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,771
someone to upset
the favorite

310
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,606
so I cannot
be bored.

311
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,567
Should be easy for you,
Kapiushon, no?

312
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,694
So I win, and then you
give us the plans.

313
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,697
Done deal.

314
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,700
Excellent.
I will go make it so.

315
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,331
You saw that goliath, right?

316
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,874
He is twice your size.

317
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,543
So I give him
half a chance.

318
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,324
You got a problem?

319
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,368
<i>Nyet.</i>

320
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,538
Oliver seems to think
you are hero now.

321
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:56,874
I'm not so sure.

322
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,002
I think you may be
like snow leopard

323
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,879
who cannot change spots.

324
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,256
You changed yours.

325
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,872
Worry less about me and
more about your friend over there.

326
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,138
I'll sweep the perimeter.

327
00:16:58,894 --> 00:16:59,895
Wow.

328
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,356
Impressive, no?

329
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,780
Anatoly, let's
get the car ready.

330
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,505
Very good! I don't think you have
many fans here, though.

331
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,259
But I am man of my word.

332
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:31,927
Not so fast.

333
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,472
This one needs to learn
not to put nose

334
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,558
in other people's business.

335
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,726
Oleg, wha... what a pleasure.

336
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,853
Did you really think
you could conduct business

337
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,730
on Bratva territory
without me knowing?

338
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,525
Of course not. This simply fighter
collecting his winnings.

339
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,111
He's no mere fighter,
are you, Oliver Queen?

340
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,614
How does he know
who you are?

341
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,117
Everyone in Russia
knows Kapiushon.

342
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,244
We have no fight
with you or the Bratva.

343
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,329
That is what we came for.

344
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,373
When we have it, we're gone.

345
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,418
The general only operates
here because we say he can.

346
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,503
And we did not say.

347
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,755
No!

348
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,387
Mia.

349
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,154
You okay?

350
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,989
Yeah, I'm fine.

351
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,284
- Where are we?
- Um.

352
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,622
Yeah, probably some
Bratva hideout.

353
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,126
I told you to stay put, Mia.
What were you thinking?

354
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,437
That we needed
to finish the mission.

355
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,261
You understand that I had
it handled, correct?

356
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,881
Uh, apparently not,
considering

357
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,841
we are tied up in
a creepy basement.

358
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,805
Why did he call you
"Kapiushon"?

359
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,104
Kapiushon is a nickname
that the Bratva gave me.

360
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,649
It means "hood."

361
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,069
You were a member
of the Bratva.

362
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,657
You should've told me.

363
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,742
I didn't want you or
William involved in this.

364
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,495
- I can handle myself.
- That is not what this is about.

365
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,704
Then what is it about?

366
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,539
Ugh. Damn it.

367
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,291
We tied your thumbs.

368
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,545
You went to a lot of
trouble to get this.

369
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,716
Even we couldn't crack
its security encryptions.

370
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,968
Must be worth
a great deal.

371
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,262
Tell me what it is.

372
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,430
No.

373
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,809
I will only ask once more.

374
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,940
You have 5 seconds.

375
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,584
- 5...
- Don't tell him anything.

376
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,196
4... 3...

377
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,448
2...

378
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,242
They're plans...

379
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,121
For a weapon that
Burov's building.

380
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,957
Was that so hard?

381
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,168
Now we can move on
to next phase.

382
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,073
Ok, what are the chances
that my father and sister

383
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:25,058
are in the clutches of the
Russian mob but aren't already dead?

384
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,687
Slim and getting slimmer
every second we do not find them.

385
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,499
Ok, their phones aren't online.
Why aren't their phones online?

386
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,609
Will have been destroyed
so as not to trace them.

387
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,797
Aren't the people
in your family

388
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,991
constantly injecting each other
with tracking devices?

389
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,243
Normally, I would say,
"God, I hope not,"

390
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,662
but now I guess I can
see the advantages.

391
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,914
Have you ever hacked
a CCTV camera?

392
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,499
- No.
- Well, congratulations.

393
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,810
You're about to learn
the only upside

394
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,252
of a Russian
surveillance state.

395
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,670
Okay.

396
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,259
The shipment
should be here soon.

397
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,923
What made you wait
till now to give me your big pitch?

398
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,976
I'm guessing Connor told you
something bad about me in the future.

399
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,021
Not just about you.

400
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,066
Tell me.

401
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,989
William finds you
on Lian Yu

402
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,949
after being there for years,

403
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,701
apparently, in some
self-imposed exile.

404
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,287
I never get rid of
my bloodlust?

405
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,808
You knew all that, and you still
thought you could come save me?

406
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,292
Because there's more
to your story.

407
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,816
You may have started
on Lian Yu, Roy,

408
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,213
but that's not
where you ended.

409
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,674
Felicity sent William to
that island to find you

410
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,009
because she believed in you.

411
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,488
You go back to Star City,
man. You work with the kids.

412
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:44,971
You help them
save the city, Roy.

413
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,431
How is that possible?

414
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,309
Because you found the way
to control your bloodlust.

415
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,605
You found that it was
by being part of a team.

416
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,876
You kept your distance because
you believed that you were a danger

417
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,194
to everyone around you,
but the real danger

418
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,614
was believing that you can deal
with your past alone.

419
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,411
It's pretty ballsy

420
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,432
thinking you can give me
the answer 20 years earlier.

421
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,096
Yeah, well, hopefully, this time,
you don't have to wait that long.

422
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,011
Don't touch her.

423
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,097
I told you everything
that I know!

424
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,265
We will see.

425
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,106
On the line.

426
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,400
No.

427
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,445
Mia, no.

428
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,908
Mi... Mi... Mia!

429
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,460
Ring the bell.

430
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,339
You have 60 seconds.

431
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,635
Begin.

432
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,219
Time is up.

433
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,615
I needed to make sure

434
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,076
you weren't lying
about the drive.

435
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,667
Got it. CCTV footage of
Mia and Dad being taken

436
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,710
into a warehouse on
the east side of town.

437
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,672
Thank you, illegal
Russian satellites.

438
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,715
Great. Well,
let's go save day.

439
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,054
Are you ok?

440
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,472
I should've been
able to do it.

441
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,016
Oh, I should have
enough slack now.

442
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,434
To do what?

443
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,312
Aah! Uh!

444
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,563
What the hell?

445
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,816
I can dislocate
my thumbs.

446
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,319
It's a useful technique
if getting tied to a chair

447
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,612
is gonna become
a habit.

448
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,614
You have got to teach me
how to do that.

449
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,259
So you not ring bell.

450
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,388
Still, very impressive
to, uh, not die.

451
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,265
You shouldn't have told
them what was on the drive.

452
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,291
They would've
killed you if I didn't.

453
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,355
Or we would've been able
to escape without you

454
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,882
- giving up the information.
- Mia.

455
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,735
Okay, can we please
just save the family squabble

456
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,153
until after we have
the plans?

457
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,279
Oleg's bound to figure out how
much they're worth.

458
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,481
Well, he's smart businessman.

459
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,491
He will figure out
way to sell it.

460
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,344
We need to
figure out when and where

461
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,346
the sale is happening,
and then we go recover the drive.

462
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,663
Let me guess.

463
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,416
Me and William get to
stay at the bar, right?

464
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,377
You're going home,
both of you.

465
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,921
No.

466
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,516
I have a feeling there's
less drama out here.

467
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,592
Yeah.

468
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,766
What do you mean, "no"?

469
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,851
I'm sorry, Dad, but we
just saved you

470
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,738
from being murdered by
a bunch of gangsters.

471
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,021
I'm on team Mia here.

472
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,607
Yeah, but Mia just got
kidnapped by the Bratva.

473
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,943
- So did you.
- I'm your father, all right?

474
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,697
It is my primary
job in the world

475
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,865
to protect you.

476
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,408
We don't need that.

477
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,827
In the future, we're the ones
that are saving the city.

478
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,287
Well, this isn't
the future!

479
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,166
This is months after

480
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,251
I was heartbroken
right before I left...

481
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,003
that I couldn't get you
on the phone

482
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,463
at your grandparents'.

483
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,384
So I walked into your room
to look at you one last time,

484
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,012
and you looked back
at me from your crib.

485
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,104
And because you made
the choice to protect us,

486
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,016
I had to spend
my whole life alone.

487
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,310
I didn't have a chance
to get to know my brother,

488
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,520
to get to know you.

489
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,271
I'm sorry that
it worked out that way.

490
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:50,944
And both of you can decide
on your own how much...

491
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,397
how much you want to hate me

492
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,322
and how much blame
you want to assign.

493
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,826
But I made a promise
to your mother to keep you safe.

494
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,869
And there... there is
no world,

495
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,788
there is no universe,
there's no past,

496
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,374
present, or future
where I break it.

497
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,293
Fine.

498
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,101
You ready?

499
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,686
As I'll ever be.

500
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,108
Let's go!

501
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,642
Must be some kind of
tamper alarm.

502
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,826
- I'll get the payload.
- I'll keep watch.

503
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,300
Hey, hey! Hey.

504
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,136
Hey, Roy.
Roy, look at me, man.

505
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,345
Look at me!

506
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,182
Roy, you're all right.

507
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,101
Y... you got it?

508
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,686
I do. It's right here.

509
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,105
Let's get
the hell out of here.

510
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,737
- Any word from your contact?
<i>- Nyet.</i>

511
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,780
Oh, these things
take time.

512
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,241
I don't know about you, but

513
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,202
I could handle drink
without umbrella.

514
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,370
I'm good, thank you.

515
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,916
If by good, you mean...
how you say... moody,

516
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,001
yes, you are.

517
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,921
Is this because you
ruin family vacation?

518
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:35,173
I have to send them home
for their protection.

519
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,824
Do you not think
they can handle it?

520
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,637
They can handle it.
I just...

521
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,431
I want to keep them
away from the Bratva.

522
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,267
You mean keep them away
from your Bratva past.

523
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,144
Dark time for me.

524
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,939
That is understandable.

525
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,524
You are ashamed.

526
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,319
You have truly done
some terrible things.

527
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,279
Thank you for
the reminder.

528
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,990
But you also have done
some good things.

529
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,493
It's important that
the kids see both.

530
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Right, but why would I
want to share some of the...

531
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:09,624
worst mistakes of my entire life
with my children?

532
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,377
That is the thing
about teaching.

533
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,630
It's not about what
you want to say.

534
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,216
It's about what they
need to hear.

535
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,678
Remember first thing
I taught you?

536
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,638
Living is not for the weak.

537
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,391
Your children are not
weak, Oliver.

538
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,060
They're also not children.

539
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,354
Whatever it is
you have to say,

540
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,398
they can handle it.

541
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:38,361
If you do not,
they will never learn to be heroes.

542
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,963
Oof. It would suck
to be that door.

543
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,985
If you're here to give me
a pep talk or whatever,

544
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,051
just don't.

545
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,344
Don't flatter yourself.

546
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,472
I just couldn't stand
the smell of that stale bar anymore.

547
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,850
It smells like cabbage.

548
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,186
That's one more thing I
won't miss about this place.

549
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,188
So you're actually
going home.

550
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,650
Why wouldn't I?
Dad doesn't want me here.

551
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,986
Oh, God. I can't stand
pity parties.

552
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,738
Easy for you to say.

553
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,282
And why is that?

554
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,535
You're the Black Canary.

555
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,955
All I've ever heard are stories
about how great you are.

556
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,750
In the future, you even
save me once

557
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,585
like it was nothing.

558
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,249
Are you sure that's actually
me you're talking about?

559
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,923
Okay, you can cut
the false modesty.

560
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,843
Some people are
cut out to be heroes,

561
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,679
others not so much.

562
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,350
Is this really all because
you didn't ring some stupid bell?

563
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,435
Well, I couldn't save
Zoe either.

564
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:01,277
Every time I try
and live up to my dad

565
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,282
or to prove that I can
do what it is you all do,

566
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,993
I... I fail.

567
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,456
Do you think your
father is any better?

568
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,587
If you're trying to
live up to us, don't.

569
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,924
We are just as flawed
as anyone,

570
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:24,926
especially me.

571
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,680
All you can do is
live up to yourself.

572
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:31,682
What does that even mean?

573
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,352
Are you really the
type of person that just gives up?

574
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:40,858
Oh, good.

575
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,025
Do we have time for
one more fight before we leave?

576
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:44,904
I'm not looking
for a fight.

577
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,351
Then stop trying to
send us home.

578
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,407
We're not leaving.

579
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:50,493
Good because I need
your help.

580
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,581
Oleg is selling drive
during bloodbath tonight.

581
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,208
And how are we
supposed to get in?

582
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,127
They know our faces.

583
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,962
Right. We use that
to our advantage.

584
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,759
You and I are going in
the ring together as a team.

585
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,012
You would be
helping us get in.

586
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,333
Sorry. I did not have
time to get it dry cleaned.

587
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,977
I'm really more of
a behind the screen kind of guy,

588
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,895
but wow. That is
a nice suit. Huh.

589
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,940
What exactly will
Anatoly and I be doing

590
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:24,026
while you two are playing
father/daughter fight club moment?

591
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:27,029
When Oleg realizes that it's
the two of us in the ring,

592
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,698
that'll cause a distraction.

593
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,105
You guys go and steal
the drive.

594
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:32,618
What do you say?

595
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,328
Well, I'm in.

596
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,873
Fancy rich guy is the role
I was born to play.

597
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,584
You?

598
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,044
Why the hell not?

599
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:45,965
Suit up.

600
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,321
Now I see why they
call it the bloodbath.

601
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,530
You sure about this?

602
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,741
Just get us in,
please.

603
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,209
Not from you, American.

604
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:23,503
Well, if it's not
about money,

605
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,214
then how about stakes?

606
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,175
Has anyone survived
6 men before?

607
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:31,469
<i>Nyet.</i>

608
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,262
My guys will fight 6.

609
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,600
You fight next.

610
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,896
Do we really need to be
setting records tonight?

611
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:45,399
You like a challenge, right?
Just please don't die.

612
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,799
Anatoly, you guys set?

613
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,823
<i>Da.</i> But no sign of
high rollers.

614
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:55,322
Now is good time to strike.

615
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,994
How much time do we have?

616
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,412
Five minutes give or take.

617
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,375
Well, this is gonna be fun.

618
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:03,685
I've seen what you
can do in there,

619
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,755
so just trust your
instincts, okay? I do.

620
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,221
<i>Nyet...</i>

621
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:12,862
That's our cue.

622
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,406
Pakhan will still be
protected.

623
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,533
I'll deal with the muscle.

624
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,493
You just watch my back.

625
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,084
Tick-tock. You guys
have the plans yet?

626
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:16,258
Don't move
or I'll shoot.

627
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,183
You said watch back.

628
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:32,274
I got it. Let's move.

629
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,137
I could actually
get used to this.

630
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,985
Congratulations. Now
you my favorite American.

631
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:19,075
Hey, don't get too excited.
He has a lot of favorite Americans.

632
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:20,716
Did you talk to John?

633
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,618
I did. He got the plutonium
with an assist from Roy.

634
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,555
All we have to do
is whip up an energy wave

635
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,206
to destroy an all-knowing
space being. Easy.

636
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,250
Before that, I would like
to propose a toast

637
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:34,044
to Mia and William.

638
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,279
Couldn't have done this
without you.

639
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:38,257
<i>Vashe zdorovie.</i>

640
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,301
Actually, here we say
<i>prochnost.</i>

641
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,011
<i>Prochnost</i>?

642
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:45,014
<i>Prochnost.</i>
It means strength.

643
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,557
It means a lot more
than that.

644
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,227
Um, would you mind
giving me a minute

645
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,395
with these two, please?

646
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,831
- Yes.
- Sure.

647
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,023
Ah. Leave the bottle.

648
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,614
I know that I haven't really
spoken to the two of you

649
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:04,533
about my time in Russia.

650
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,579
And that is because there
are some things that I did here

651
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:10,664
that I'm not
very proud of.

652
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:15,419
As I'm coming to grips with the fact
that the two of you are grown up,

653
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:16,921
I'm realizing that

654
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,216
shielding you from the bad

655
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:25,429
isn't going to do
our relationships any good.

656
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,766
From this point forward,
whatever you want to know,

657
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:33,646
whatever you might want
to ask me is fair game, okay?

658
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,582
Like dislocating
your thumbs?

659
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:36,917
'Cause I can't believe
I missed that.

660
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,692
Maybe something
a little less painful.

661
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,321
What about that island
you were on?

662
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:45,491
It's Lian Yu.

663
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:48,452
It's Mandarin
for "purgatory."

664
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,400
<i>You think
that'll be enough?</i>

665
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,542
Yeah, well, this
should do the trick.

666
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:58,838
Roy, thanks for
your help, man.

667
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,809
It was good having you back,
even if it was

668
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,591
just for one last
mission.

669
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,940
I think I'm gonna
stick around for a while.

670
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,070
If you're gonna be
taking on a space god,

671
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,100
I figure you might need
all the help you can get.

672
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,809
I'm glad you changed
your mind.

673
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,436
You know, when I
first met Oliver,

674
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,314
he gave me a purpose,

675
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,441
but he also gave me
all of you.

676
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,694
It makes sense that
having a team is

677
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,238
what helps me in
the future, so why wait?

678
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,076
Besides, you know,
I kind of miss this place.

679
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,289
Welcome back, Roy.

680
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,171
Don't forget to send me that picture
of my dad with that haircut.

681
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:43,549
Don't forget to ask
about Bratva tattoo.

682
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:44,884
We have matching.

683
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,510
Used to.
Used to, actually.

684
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:49,722
Oh, ho. I'm gonna need to
hear that story immediately.

685
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,392
Thank you.

686
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,019
I always seem to end up
in your debt.

687
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:56,645
We are beyond
keeping score.

688
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,190
We have been friends,
we have been enemies.

689
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,443
From now on, let us
just be brothers.

690
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,611
Not the Bratva kind.

691
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:07,823
No! Real family, like
the one you have now.

692
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,618
I can be the fun uncle.

693
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,997
Being father really
suits you.

694
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,542
Good-bye, brother.

695
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,669
Thank you.
Good-bye, Oliver.

696
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,463
All right. Let's go.

697
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,884
Oh, Laurel, uh...

698
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:28,677
there's something
I want to say.

699
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:32,473
What? One last hilarious
Russian joke for the road?

700
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:34,892
Sorry to doubt you.

701
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,811
I guess leopards really
can change spots.

702
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,981
Or in your case,
bird, feather.

703
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,121
I thought you said you
weren't sentimental.

704
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:46,987
Maybe I change, too,
like you.

705
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,583
Did you bring the plans?

706
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,294
About that.

707
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,546
I have decided not
to join you

708
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,465
and your cosmic
fashion tragedy

709
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,008
that you're
in cahoots with.

710
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,843
Then you won't get
your Earth back.

711
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,513
If saving it means going back
to the person that I used to be,

712
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,431
then what the hell
is the point?

713
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,559
You really have changed.

714
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:21,647
Look, I'm new to this whole
doing the right thing game,

715
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,942
but you should really tell
your family the truth.

716
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:26,610
Not yet.

717
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,904
Then this is gonna be
a little awkward.

718
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,247
I didn't want to
believe it.

719
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm sorry.

720
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:48,841
Lyla, what have you...
what have you done?

721
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,791
Greg, move your head.
