1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,110
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,976
- And you want my help.
- Yeah. I never thought this day

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,176
would come either,
but here we are.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,157
- Time to go, inmate.
- Where are you taking me?

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,680
You're going back
to level one.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,031
- Where did you get this?
- Felicity.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,799
She's the one who
sent us to Star City.

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,758
I'm so sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,673
but Felicity Smoak
is dead.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,799
Just making good
on an old promise.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,960
Isn't that right, Anatoly?

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,394
You, uh...

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,669
You remember the last time
we saw each other?

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,591
You killed my brothers,
all of them.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,640
Let me, um... let me
jog your memory.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,478
You betrayed me...

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,556
After I trusted you...

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,473
<i>I gave you
my friendship.</i>

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,429
Man like you
has no friends.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,711
Where are
your friends now?

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Huh?

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,470
Oliver Queen!

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,758
No!

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,039
The Arrow team...

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,238
They're all gone,
brother.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,597
You picked
the losing side.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,150
What are you
waiting for?

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,515
Kill me!

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,072
Not yet. I got
a little job for you.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,236
You're gonna help me

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,191
destroy Oliver Queen.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,478
I thought that mind control
stuff only happened in movies.

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,711
It wasn't exactly
mind control.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,637
This place seems like
it's gotten a lot worse.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
They came in after you stabbed that guard.

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,153
These guys are
professional jerks.

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,313
Less yard time,
cell checks every half-hour.

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,400
Have they been
rough on you?

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,630
Me? No way.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,393
I'm glad they're here.

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,475
Brick's been pissed ever since
you shut down his fight club,

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,472
and I'm the only one
he can take it out on.

43
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,394
If they weren't here,
he'd have come after me.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,632
You totally saved me.
Typical Green Arrow move.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,114
Pick it up.

46
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,391
I thought dunbar was
on brick's payroll.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,870
Not anymore. Ever since
that fight club fiasco,

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,793
dunbar's got a slap
on the wrist.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,839
Now he treats brick
like, well, you.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,033
On your feet, 4587.

51
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,032
- Speaking of.
- Time to go.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,351
Have my meal privileges
been revoked?

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,239
I said, let's go, inmate.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm not telling you again.

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,275
That's what I thought.
You have a visitor.

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,960
I thought I didn't
have any visitation.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,753
Well, it must be
your lucky day.

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,034
- What do you want?
- Try sounding a little bit more grateful, Ollie.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,793
I had to file
an emergency motion

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,354
just to get in here
to see you,

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,176
and it's a good thing
that I did because you

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,271
look like crap.

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,079
Just need to document...

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,675
- Hey.
- Your injuries really fast.

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,840
What are you doing?

66
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,161
We got the level two
psych records

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,318
from wherever or whoever you
had sneak them out of slabside.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,199
How did you do that,
by the way? No, no.

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,320
Never mind.
Don't tell me.

70
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,232
It's better for your case
if I don't know.

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,629
What do you mean,
my case?

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,953
- Your case.
- What... what are you working

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,270
with Jean loring?

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,635
No. I'm working
with your wife.

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,234
Felicity would have told me
if she was working with you,

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,511
and the only reason that
you would ever help me

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,435
or anyone is if there was
something in it for you.

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,557
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,592
You're the reason that Diaz
got away in the first place.

80
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Do you remember?

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,756
You know, the Ollie
I knew,

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,351
he had a hard time taking
responsibility for his failures, too.

83
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,151
You know what's
amazing?

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,279
You're nothing
like her.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,552
<i>So go ahead and pretend
to be Laurel,</i>

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,916
<i>my Laurel,
for as long as you want.</i>

87
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,873
You never will be,
ever.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,670
Stay away
from my wife.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,156
I can't believe
she's dead.

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,630
Here.

91
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,709
I don't really drink.

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,155
<i>Well, I do.</i>

93
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,954
So what happened?

94
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
How did she die?

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,117
It was a couple
weeks ago,

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,913
give or take.

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
She was murdered.

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
Murdered?

99
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,395
Who would hurt
Felicity?

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,552
Roy, the Felicity you knew
was very different

101
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,030
than what she became.

102
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,554
We wanted her to join us,

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,995
<i>but she cut ties.</i>

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,320
Instead, she went
underground.

105
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,597
She started calling
herself the calculator.

106
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,400
- Like her father?
<i>- She ran in some dangerous Circles.</i>

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,789
You walk that path
long enough,

108
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,872
sooner or later,
it catches up to you.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,319
I'm sorry, William.

110
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,638
However Felicity died,

111
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,677
whatever the circumstances,

112
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,796
she still sent me
this signal,

113
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,390
and I need to know why.

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,318
You don't owe her
anything, William.

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,153
Yeah? Well, maybe
she owed me.

116
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,439
OK. I noticed
this earlier.

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,273
You see
the color variation?

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,256
I think Felicity was
trying to lead us there.

119
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,478
This is kind of crazy.
You know that, right?

120
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,109
All I know is
I've come this far.

121
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,033
I'm not stopping now.

122
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,936
Has the silencer's flight
touched down from Moscow yet?

123
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,917
An hour ago in Star City
just like we thought.

124
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,256
My facial recognition algorithm
indicates she hasn't had a rendezvous

125
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
yet with Diaz,
but I did get an update

126
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,037
on why Diaz sent
the silencer to Russia.

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Anatoly Knyazev?

128
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,936
I can't get
specific confirmation,

129
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,235
but the rumor
on the dark web is

130
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
that the entire Bratva
was massacred

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,270
two nights ago
in Moscow,

132
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,440
which doesn't bode well
for our frenemy Anatoly.

133
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,696
How'd things go with Oliver?
Is he OK?

134
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,155
He's fine. He hates me,
he thinks I'm a monster,

135
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
and he doesn't want my help,
but he's fine.

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,078
Oh. OK. Listen. I mean, prison's
obviously been rough on Oliver.

137
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,816
I mean, that's the whole point of prison.
Duh!

138
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,275
But he doesn't know
the new you.

139
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,912
I mean, he just knows the old,
scarier, murdery version of you.

140
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,576
I don't really care what
Oliver thinks of me,

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,353
but he doesn't want me
representing him,

142
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,280
and I don't know how quickly you're
gonna find substitute counsel.

143
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,416
No way. We are not changing
our strategy, not now.

144
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,200
Oliver's constitutional
rights were violated.

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,736
A prosecutor stepping over to the
opposite side of the line to defend him

146
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,160
is the best leverage
that we have.

147
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I just got a hit.

148
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,200
<i>Diaz and the 3 Longbow Hunters
were spotted</i>

149
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
outside a munitions plant
in orchid bay.

150
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,472
He's probably looking
for some kind of weapon.

151
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,956
Too bad he's not gonna live
long enough to get it.

152
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,959
We have to move
before they change locations.

153
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,759
Why do bad guys always
pick the creepiest places?

154
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,559
Oh, wait. Was that
a serious question?

155
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,216
Well, I mean, you used to be a bad guy...
well, gal,

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,160
so I figured you'd know.

157
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,880
This doesn't look like
official D.A. business.

158
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,918
Did we have to
invite him?

159
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,515
- Are you two, like, friends now?
- It's a long story,

160
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,115
but the punch line is that the
silencer and Diaz are inside,

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,176
which means we're finally gonna
get a chance to bring them down.

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,999
And you know this how?
Oh, wait.

163
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,469
Let me guess.
Long story.

164
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,869
Can we just
leave it at that?

165
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,800
- So are you in?
- You really got to ask?

166
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,176
Where the hell
is she?

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,554
According
to my tracker,

168
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,234
she's... she's in there.

169
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,913
- Bomb!
<i>- Go, go, move, move,</i>

170
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,275
move, move, move!

171
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,600
A.R.G.U.S. has been
tracking Diaz ever since

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,160
he slaughtered
the Bratva in Russia.

173
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,273
The SCPD was responding to
a munitions plant break-In,

174
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,520
so please tell me,
Felicity,

175
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,995
how the hell do you end up in
the middle of my op again?

176
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,277
Why don't I just say
exponential search algorithm,

177
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,960
and we'll just leave
it at that?

178
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,555
We planted a tracker
on the silencer's belt.

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,120
<i>Obviously, Diaz must
have found it</i>

180
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,676
and is using it
as bait against us.

181
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,753
How did you manage that? You were
nowhere near the silencer at the CDC.

182
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,236
That thing at
the CDC was you guys?

183
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,274
Uh, Felicity
wasn't near her. I was.

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,113
We snuck her
out together.

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,158
So you two
captured the silencer?

186
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,630
But Felicity and Laurel were
the ones that tortured her.

187
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,435
Actually, I convinced her not to.
You're welcome.

188
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,736
So now you're
working with Laurel?

189
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,736
- I'm standing right here.
<i>- To be fair, she did help</i>

190
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,229
shut down that illegal
psychiatric program at slabside.

191
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Wait. Hold on a sec.
You're gonna give me

192
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,833
crap about working with
the new Green Arrow,

193
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,280
and meanwhile,
you're siding with the black frickin' siren?

194
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,720
Again, still here.

195
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,416
You're working
with the new Green Arrow?

196
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,750
Guys, I think
that the whole point of this

197
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,680
is that maybe we could all pick
up our phones a little more, huh,

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
<i>shoot a text.</i>

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,639
Yeah. I am totally
talking about the fact

200
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,598
that everyone forgot
my birthday last week.

201
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,399
Your party is next week.
Act surprised!

202
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,536
- OK, now that all
- really?

203
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
<i>Of our deep,
dark secrets are out,</i>

204
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,176
do you think that we could switch
our focus back to the psycho

205
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,554
who just tried
to blow us up?

206
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,234
Sounds like good idea.

207
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,596
First, ground rules.
No new Green Arrow.

208
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,275
Secondly, no one who
isn't from this Earth.

209
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
You're kicking me out?

210
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,473
Well, you are the D.A.

211
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,976
<i>You could have been
exposed tonight,</i>

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,071
and I think there's
no need to risk that again.

213
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,870
So an international
mob boss gets to stay

214
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,394
and I have to leave,
is that it?

215
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,074
Huh! Unbelievable.

216
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,356
Laurel, wait.

217
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,874
Laurel, please wait.

218
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,560
It looks like you and your husband
don't need my help after all.

219
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,672
He does, we do, I do,
but, more importantly,

220
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,672
I need the D.A.
to help Oliver.

221
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,911
Well,
I was happy to help your little charity case

222
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,079
when I had some downtime,
but now that Diaz is back in, I don't.

223
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
Laurel, Laurel, please!

224
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,376
If I could trade
places with you

225
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,393
so that you could
go get Diaz, I would,

226
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,836
but this is my only chance
to get Oliver out of prison.

227
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,509
This is it! This...

228
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,715
This is my only chance
to get my husband back.

229
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,758
Laurel, please.

230
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
You know, sometimes,
I really hate being your Laurel.

231
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,838
I promise you that when we catch Diaz,
I will call you

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,515
and we will finish this
just like we planned.

233
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,875
Fine.

234
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,477
We're close. Should be
just up here.

235
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,016
All these years,
and you're still that boy who hates

236
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,269
not knowing stuff.

237
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,995
Are you still that girl who
loves getting into trouble?

238
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,554
You know it.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,639
It's good
seeing you.

240
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,837
I tried to keep in
touch after everything.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,710
Yeah, I know.
Guess it was just easier

242
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,678
for me to move on
than to hold on, you know?

243
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,480
Wish I could do
the same sometimes.

244
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,112
I cannot believe that
they're full-grown adults.

245
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,999
Which means
we're old.

246
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,799
I never thought I'd
see you again.

247
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,316
This is the last place I ever
thought I'd come back to.

248
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,153
I wanted William
to leave me on Lian Yu.

249
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,636
How did he
convince you?

250
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,432
I found a message
inside of Oliver's bow,

251
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,836
the mark of four.

252
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,430
That's impossible.
Who could've put it there?

253
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,831
I don't know,
but I think it's best

254
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,679
that we keep this
between us.

255
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,031
None of us have seen
William for years.

256
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
You sure we can
trust him?

257
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,589
He's Oliver's son.

258
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,997
That is exactly
what worries me.

259
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,272
Hey. According
to the map, it's only

260
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,318
a few hundred more
feet this way.

261
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,633
- Let's go, inmate.
- What? Where?

262
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,355
<i>Oh, you're going
to the hole permanently.</i>

263
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,715
Hey.
What's going on?

264
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,190
Officer dunbar was
killed last night,

265
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,176
and this little bastard was
the last one seen with him.

266
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,271
What?!
I didn't kill anybody. It wasn't me!

267
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,576
Wait. How do you know
it was him?

268
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,432
Oliver,
it wasn't me, I swear!

269
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,950
It must have been brick!
He set me up!

270
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,999
<i>Oliver! Oliver!</i>

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,071
Look who just got out
of the loony bin.

272
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,799
You learn any
life lessons in there?

273
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,236
Maybe those doctors helped
get your head on straight.

274
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,760
Tell me what you know
about dunbar's murder.

275
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,832
Sounds like you're
accusing us of something.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,720
I heard the poor chap
got stabbed 8 times.

277
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,916
Messy way to go.

278
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,117
You and he had
a falling out, brick.

279
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
Maybe we did,
and maybe we didn't.

280
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,799
Maybe an innocent man is rotting
in the hole in your place.

281
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,192
There are no innocent men in here, Queen.
You should know that.

282
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,239
Brick, Stanley
didn't kill that guard.

283
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,357
Well, I guess he's got
nothing to worry about.

284
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,034
The truth
will set him free.

285
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,120
Go ahead.

286
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,958
Then you can join your
friend in the hole.

287
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Hey, brick.

288
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,229
If you or anyone
in your crew

289
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,998
had something to do with this,
I'll find out.

290
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,114
Come on.

291
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,516
Meet pyotr Roslov...

292
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,634
former KGB, lots of deep,
scary ties to the Russian military.

293
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,080
Oh. He looks like
a real charmer.

294
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,431
Hmm. He is not.
Pyotr and I were associates at KGB,

295
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,354
but we had
a disagreement.

296
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,394
Then why did Diaz
have you call him?

297
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,314
Diaz wants to buy some kind of
very powerful weapon from him.

298
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,359
<i>He wants to destroy
Oliver Queen</i>

299
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,956
by destroying
what he loves, his city.

300
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,918
That's why Diaz
was trying to steal

301
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,160
the directed energy
weapon.

302
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,794
And whatever was
at the CDC.

303
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,680
We find out where Diaz plans to
launch his attack, we snag him there,

304
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,269
we find out what Roslov
sold him,

305
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,110
and you're gonna help us.

306
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,312
No, no, no. No.
Pyotr can smell a rat.

307
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,880
Anatoly, we will
help you.

308
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,111
I play hero
once before,

309
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,755
and Diaz killed all of my
brothers as punishment.

310
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,991
- Never again.
- Oliver was your brother, too,

311
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,239
and he would want you
to help us get Diaz.

312
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,317
Yeah, but Oliver tried
to do the same thing.

313
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,632
Look where he is now. No.
Time for me to go somewhere nice, tropical.

314
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,075
Maldives maybe.

315
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,560
I think it's
really hard to travel

316
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,195
when you're on homeland
security's most wanted list.

317
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,953
Yes, but I am
on no such...

318
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,355
you are threatening me?

319
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,432
Call it an enthusiastic
suggestion.

320
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,711
<i>A couple minutes
in Roslov's office,</i>

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,639
you download
his hard drive,

322
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,160
you're on your way
to the Maldives.

323
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,516
You're not Felicity Smoak
I remember.

324
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,030
Well, she couldn't
catch Diaz.

325
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,271
Maybe this one can.

326
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,840
I got a visual.

327
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,553
<i>Anatoly Knyazev.</i>

328
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
He's in.

329
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:57,709
I suppose I owe
you a debt of gratitude

330
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,515
for sending the dragon
my way, Knyazev.

331
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,435
Oh. I'm pleased your dealings with
Mr. Diaz were, uh, profitable.

332
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,720
Oh. Yes.
Very profitable.

333
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,120
Speaking of, you need
4K TV, sarin gas?

334
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,478
All fall off truck,
I swear.

335
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
<i>Anatoly,
you need to get to that computer.</i>

336
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,354
Eh, pyotr,
why don't we sit down

337
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,994
like old friends?

338
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,590
Good.
Now distract him and insert the drive.

339
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Something wrong?

340
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,597
I... I was promised
drink.

341
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,838
Um, on rocks...
Please.

342
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
<i>Good.</i>

343
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,280
He's got incoming.
Anatoly's been compromised.

344
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,320
We have to get him
out of there.

345
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,801
The drive still needs a minute
before he can retrieve the data.

346
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,314
Felicity, he doesn't
have a minute.

347
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,376
<i>Anatoly, there is
no immediate threat.</i>

348
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
<i>Keep him talking.</i>

349
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,520
Forgive me, pyotr.

350
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
<i>Felicity!</i>

351
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,478
Losing Bratva was
very painful.

352
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,156
The pain taught me to see all
the pain that I have inflicted.

353
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,480
I'm hoping that you can see it
in your heart to forgive me.

354
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,078
A snake may shed its skin,

355
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,920
but it is still
a snake.

356
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,149
Go!

357
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,396
<i>Anatoly.</i>

358
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,199
Oh. Yes. We got it.

359
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,316
Damn it.

360
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,192
Hey. How's Anatoly?

361
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,511
He'll be out cold for a few hours,
but he'll be fine.

362
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,176
- Good.
- Felicity, it wouldn't have been

363
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,560
if I showed up
a few seconds later.

364
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,399
But he is fine,
and we got this.

365
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,856
It's encrypted
and probably in cyrillic,

366
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,216
so it's gonna take me
a while to decode,

367
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,675
but it is a huge lead
on what Diaz is planning.

368
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,616
And this would have been
worth Anatoly's life?

369
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,976
Well,
think about how many lives we're gonna lose

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,070
if we don't stop Diaz.

371
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,920
We all have to take risks
in the field, dig.

372
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,872
That's true,
but this was a risk

373
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,798
that you coerced him
into taking, Felicity.

374
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,555
I'm sorry that
he got hurt, I am,

375
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,191
but we got intel on Diaz
because I didn't give up.

376
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,114
Give up? Felicity,
I didn't give up.

377
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,320
You pushed me out.
You wanted to do things your way,

378
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,456
<i>and I supported
that decision,</i>

379
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,936
but that was before
I knew your decision

380
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,200
involved risking
innocent lives.

381
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,873
Anatoly is hardly
a girl scout,

382
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,600
and don't lecture me,
especially because you haven't been around.

383
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,560
I am willing to do whatever
it takes to end this.

384
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,870
But then what?

385
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,911
Felicity, I've known you
for a long time,

386
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,440
and you are a good person,

387
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,096
but I've been
to the front lines,

388
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,918
and I know exactly
what that does to people.

389
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,471
I just hope when
this war is over,

390
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,479
you still come out a hero.

391
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,270
Hey. You OK?

392
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,356
The guards, they took
turns hitting me.

393
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,040
They think I killed
their friend.

394
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,873
Stanley, did they
say why?

395
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,879
They haven't even found
the murder weapon.

396
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,957
Dunbar's a jerk,
but I would never hurt him.

397
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,157
I would never hurt anyone.

398
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,875
Oliver, if they pin
this on me,

399
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm gonna be
in here forever.

400
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,709
Stanley, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

401
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,032
I heard that it happened
in the shower.

402
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,429
- OK.
- But that doesn't even

403
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,798
make sense because I wasn't even
close to there when that guy...

404
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,596
I know if anyone can find
out what really happened,

405
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,440
it's the Green Arrow.

406
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
Just sit tight, OK?

407
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,356
OK.

408
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,470
Of course.

409
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,516
I'm sure you're
wondering what a state D.A.

410
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,273
is doing here
in federal court,

411
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,756
representing someone on the
opposite side of the law.

412
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,719
I am.
This is highly unusual.

413
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,112
I'm here as an officer
of the court.

414
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,473
This... is Oliver Queen's
current condition.

415
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,514
He has been
psychologically tortured,

416
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,797
harassed, and assaulted.

417
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,640
<i>Upon information and belief,
Mr. Queen also had</i>

418
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,757
the opportunity
to escape slabside

419
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,755
but instead smuggled information
out to help his fellow inmates.

420
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,879
<i>And you feel these things
should negate his conviction?</i>

421
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,600
Yes. Oliver Queen made
a deal with the FBI

422
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,713
to protect his city,
but the FBI failed

423
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,434
to hold up their end
of the bargain.

424
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,360
<i>Meanwhile, Diaz has
continued to commit</i>

425
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,790
numerous other crimes
and nearly succeeded

426
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,236
in murdering Mr. Queen's
wife and child

427
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,471
while they were
in federal witness protection.

428
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,353
Anything further,
Ms. Lance?

429
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,720
Your honor, the hardest
thing to do is to be a hero

430
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,116
when no one expects
you to be.

431
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,232
The easier path
is to be a criminal.

432
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,110
The past 6 months,
Oliver Queen has chosen

433
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,591
the hard road and has been
a hero in terrible conditions,

434
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,798
and since the FBI has not
held up their end of the deal,

435
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,029
Oliver Queen deserves
to be a free man.

436
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,115
I agree that
a federal investigation

437
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,438
into the conditions
of slabside should be ordered.

438
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,630
<i>However, I'm unconvinced that
Mr. Queen should be released at this time.</i>

439
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,917
Therefore,
his conviction stands.

440
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,594
<i>Your appeal is denied.</i>

441
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,960
Got your message.
Are you in?

442
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,136
Felicity had
the brilliant idea

443
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,976
to use a cyrillic dictionary
attack on the table

444
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,920
of hashed passwords.

445
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,320
It was pretty
brilliant of me.

446
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,075
Our friend Roslov,
on the other hand, less brilliant.

447
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,856
His decryption key
is the Russian equivalent

448
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,109
of "password69."

449
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,875
Once we translated all the data,
this is what we got.

450
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,350
Say hello to betab-500.

451
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,536
<i>Yeah. That's a top-of-the-line
aerial explosive,</i>

452
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,835
razor-thin precision,

453
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,071
able to cut through
concrete like nothing.

454
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,696
Well, Diaz has two of them,
so that means our

455
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,393
list of potential
targets just doubled.

456
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,480
Keep working
on that hard drive.

457
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:31,630
What are you
gonna do?

458
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,555
Prepare for a mass evac
of Star City.

459
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,760
Why'd you do it, Turner?

460
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,336
What the hell are
you talking about?

461
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,555
Why'd you kill dunbar?

462
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,915
I didn't kill
that guard.

463
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,434
Your blade says you did.

464
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,554
Guards found
prints on it.

465
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,351
Turner, you're going
to the hole,

466
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,557
and this time,
you're never coming out.

467
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,317
You did this? Hey, w-wait.
You got the wrong guy.

468
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,791
You got the wrong guy.

469
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,200
I didn't do this.

470
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,711
Hey. I heard
you were up.

471
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,280
How are you feeling?

472
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,317
Heart pounding in head.

473
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,678
Each beat... pow...
like knife to brain.

474
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,317
I'm sorry. I should have
gotten you out sooner.

475
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,920
So you are not new
Felicity Smoak after all.

476
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
What do you mean?

477
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,999
You want
to be ruthless

478
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,794
to pursue madman,

479
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,559
I'll not judge you.

480
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,752
I am, after all,
wanted criminal.

481
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,032
I actually thought you'd be more
pissed I almost got you killed.

482
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,759
Of course I'm angry.

483
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,434
You threaten
my life,

484
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,432
but I don't like
apologies.

485
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,835
You cannot take away
mistake by wishing it so.

486
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,155
In my line of work,
you make choice,

487
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,118
you do not look back.

488
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,672
Ah. So you don't regret working
against us with Diaz last year?

489
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,756
Regret, guilt.
These are Demons you choose to live with,

490
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,835
a trade you make
to get what you want.

491
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,277
How bad do you want
to kill Ricardo Diaz?

492
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,834
More than anything.

493
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,800
Well, then you
embrace Demons.

494
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,473
No more half measures.

495
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,871
When I work with Oliver
in Russia,

496
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,514
he was not villain,

497
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,959
<i>but he did what
needed to be done.</i>

498
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,631
You remind me
of him then.

499
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,114
What would that Oliver
have done in this situation?

500
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,791
He would have ended
Diaz,

501
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,316
and he wouldn't care
about the cost.

502
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,794
Hey! Laurel,
you look a little upset.

503
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Why don't we go
cool off?

504
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:12,961
Get out of my way.

505
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,231
It seems like you were
about to open your mouth

506
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,080
and do something you're going to regret,
counselor.

507
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,760
<i>I'm not an attorney,</i>

508
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,032
as you've reminded me
many times.

509
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,936
You sure looked like one
in that courtroom today.

510
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,077
Yeah. Well, it doesn't
matter, does it?

511
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,034
Oliver's not getting
out of prison.

512
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,480
Now, if you don't mind,
I have

513
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,075
some unfinished business
with that judge.

514
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,800
Did you even bother to
listen to yourself in court?

515
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,560
You spoke
from your heart.

516
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,876
Big surprise, by the way,
you do have one.

517
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You said, "the hardest
thing to do was to be a hero

518
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,078
"when no one
expects you to be.

519
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,391
"The easier path
is to be a criminal."

520
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,393
What do you
care, anyway?

521
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,952
If anybody knows the true me,
the real me,

522
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,554
it's you.

523
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,936
You know,
you've been telling people for 6 months now

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,599
you've changed.

525
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,336
It wasn't until I saw
you in that courtroom

526
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,589
that I actually
believed it.

527
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,598
Do not throw that away just
because it's getting hard now.

528
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,439
I don't want you coming to one of
my court appearances ever again.

529
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,616
<i>This has to be
where Felicity was hiding out.</i>

530
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,711
Yeah,
but doing what?

531
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,109
Uh, guys.

532
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,795
<i>You have
triggered security protocols.</i>

533
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,231
<i>If you do not provide
access credentials</i>

534
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,516
<i>in 30 seconds,</i>

535
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,639
<i>you will be terminated.</i>

536
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,675
All our weapons
were targeted.

537
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,035
Please say
you can hack this.

538
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,919
Hack Felicity?
Yeah, right!

539
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,839
<i>Denied.</i>

540
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
She wouldn't lead us here
without access.

541
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,790
What are those?

542
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,275
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

543
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,794
No freakin' way.

544
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,996
Get the bow.

545
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,438
<i>Termination in 10, 9, 8, 7...</i>

546
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,432
Remember how
my dad used to train?

547
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,391
<i>...6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...</i>

548
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,033
<i>Access granted.</i>

549
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,635
You'd think Felicity would
have made that a lot easier.

550
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,960
She's obviously
trying to protect something.

551
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,914
I'll bring up the last
files she accessed.

552
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,160
<i>These are
structural maps</i>

553
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,232
<i>of all the buildings
throughout Star City.</i>

554
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,312
City hall,
central library,

555
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,834
old rockets arena...

556
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,440
all areas
outside The Glades.

557
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,440
Yeah. Along with schematics
to build explosives

558
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,750
and the money
to fund it.

559
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,474
This is a plan to level
all of Star City.

560
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,995
What you got?

561
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,158
Anatoly said in order to catch Diaz,
I couldn't worry about the cost.

562
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,576
Felicity,
you know how I feel about this.

563
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,616
I know, and that's not
the point.

564
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,677
The point is that Diaz
does worry about the cost.

565
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,354
I mean, it's basically
his whole M.O.

566
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,749
Diaz wants to
make a statement.

567
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,718
The man carries around
a flamethrower.

568
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
Subtlety isn't
his strong suit.

569
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,656
So I started wondering,
what is a statement worthy of a dragon?

570
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,080
I ran an algorithm
cross-referencing

571
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,794
the betab-500 and the
manufacturer's specification.

572
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,595
Turns out that this model
is a new version,

573
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,080
where you can attach
it to a pipe.

574
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,760
For instance,
a pipe underground filled with gas.

575
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,096
<i>- Gas plant.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

576
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,496
That building's
totally fireproof.

577
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,795
Rest of the city,
not so much.

578
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,296
<i>If Diaz sets off
those bombs,</i>

579
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,880
a whole river of gas
underneath the city

580
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
goes up in flames
literally.

581
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,039
OK. A.R.G.U.S. will
continue the evac.

582
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,520
We'll handle these bombs.

583
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,896
Does that mean what
I think it means?

584
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,256
Call the whole team.
We're gonna need all the help

585
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,555
we can get
on this one.

586
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,456
I miss
good old says

587
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,711
when bomb could be turned
off by computer far away

588
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
in dark warehouse.

589
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:54,296
Yeah. These are not
those type of bombs,

590
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,736
and since we're on the
topic of freaking out,

591
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,296
the bombs are linked,
which means we can't disarm one

592
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,674
without detonating
the other.

593
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,976
Which means
we'll have to disarm them

594
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
at the exact same time.

595
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,117
It's like
the world's worst trust fall.

596
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,437
Ohh. I was hoping it would
look less scary in person.

597
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,336
- Wishful thinking.
- Bogey number one is attached

598
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,440
to the main pipeline leading
straight into Star City.

599
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,114
We got eyes
on the second bomb.

600
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,040
Guys, this timer's
started already.

601
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,315
Mine, too.

602
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,600
This timer was
activated manually.

603
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,716
Diaz is still here.

604
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,160
Dinah, meet me outside.

605
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Anatoly, Rene.

606
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,920
We'll keep an eye
on the bomb squad.

607
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,072
Bring in our exfil.

608
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,000
I want to watch the fireworks
from above.

609
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,696
Curtis, each linking device is
protected by its own crypto-key.

610
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,191
We decrypt the passcodes, and then we
input them at the exact same time.

611
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,480
Yeah. I'm gonna need a little
bit more time on my end.

612
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
You got the easy bomb.

613
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,035
We do not
have more time.

614
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,594
- When can we run?
- Not now.

615
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,216
<i>Guys, we have a problem.</i>

616
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
<i>My little bundle of joy came
with a backup detonator.</i>

617
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,616
- Cell phone transmitter.
<i>- Can you remove it?</i>

618
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,696
Not if we don't want
to set it off.

619
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,056
We can't input those passcodes
until we have that master phone.

620
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,896
Once Diaz realizes that
the timers have been stopped...

621
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,754
he blows us up with phone call.
Festive.

622
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
You go get that phone.
I got this.

623
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,915
Got the passcode.
Ready to input it.

624
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,715
I'm ready, too.
Dig, Rene, do you copy?

625
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Anyone?

626
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,034
Come on. Come on, Rene.

627
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,000
We cannot wait any longer.
They're gonna come through.

628
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,479
OK. On 3.
1, 2, 3, type.

629
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,070
Now we run.

630
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,078
Impressive,
but it's pointless.

631
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,395
Impossible.

632
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,559
<i>Breaking News
out of Star City.</i>

633
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,350
<i>Notorious fugitive Ricardo Diaz
is behind bars tonight,</i>

634
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,592
<i>thanks to the efforts
of the unidentified Green Arrow.</i>

635
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,797
<i>Earlier this evening,
the vigilante foiled</i>

636
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,152
<i>an attempted bombing
at the natural gas plant,</i>

637
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,631
<i>leaving many to wonder
should the anti-vigilante law</i>

638
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,870
<i>be revoked.</i>

639
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,872
Well,
just like the good old days, huh?

640
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,800
The Green Arrow swooping
in to save the day.

641
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,000
We do all the work,
and he gets all the credit.

642
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,269
About time he got
some credit.

643
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,936
The important thing is
we caught Diaz.

644
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,838
And this is a huge collar for the SCPD.

645
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,096
The feds are gonna be pissed
they didn't get him first,

646
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,840
and we are gonna charge Diaz
with every crime in the book.

647
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,755
Guys, we caught Diaz.

648
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,656
This is what can happen
when we all work together.

649
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,016
I don't want to say
I told you so...

650
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,839
but you are, right?

651
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,416
<i>Let's go get a drink
to celebrate.</i>

652
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,397
- We deserve it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

653
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,475
Well, Felicity,
after everything, you did it.

654
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,635
<i>How's it feel?</i>

655
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,199
Well... Diaz is
behind bars.

656
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,432
What could be
better than that?

657
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,160
<i>I mean, I thought
I made myself clear.</i>

658
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,110
I don't want your help.

659
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,437
That's just too bad because
as your legal counsel,

660
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,837
I am obligated to inform
you of your case status.

661
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,999
<i>That should be your copy
of the court's ruling.</i>

662
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,112
Spoiler alert...
we lost.

663
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
Must be difficult
to win a case

664
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,153
when you're not
a real lawyer.

665
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,598
Says here the judge is
ordering an investigation

666
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,673
into prisoner abuse
at slabside?

667
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,520
Turns out the government
isn't a big fan

668
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,115
of lobotomizing
their prisoners.

669
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,877
That will help a lot
of people in here.

670
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,720
Ahem. Thank you.

671
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,758
I don't want your thanks.

672
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,116
I didn't do this for you.
I did this for me,

673
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,878
and, no, I am not
your Laurel.

674
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,153
I'm not the old Laurel.
I'm me.

675
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,193
Everyone has good
and bad inside of them,

676
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,435
and you can't put people
in one box or the other ever.

677
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Vodka?

678
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,634
What, because
I am Russian?

679
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,752
That is stereotype,

680
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,555
but da, yes, vodka.

681
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,393
I only have a bit left.

682
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,791
I hope they have vodka
in the Maldives,

683
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,236
that is, if you can do
an American accent.

684
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,197
<i>Hello. I am Jason Brown</i>

685
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,192
from Denver, Colorado.

686
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Heh.

687
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,429
<i>Spasiba.</i>

688
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,037
You're a strong person,
Felicity Smoak.

689
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,920
You catch dragon.

690
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,479
<i>Now don't look back.</i>

691
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,512
Doesn't make
any sense.

692
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,916
Felicity wouldn't do
something like this.

693
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,232
Like we said,
she changed.

694
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,629
OK. Let's say
you're right

695
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,918
and Felicity somehow
became overwatch of evil.

696
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Why lead us here?

697
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:55,680
Maybe she had
a change of heart,

698
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,234
tried to back out
last second.

699
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,631
It'd explain why someone would
want her dead, right?

700
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,950
Not to state
the obvious,

701
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,920
but if we start poking around,
it's gonna make

702
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,076
us targets, too.

703
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,074
None of us have any idea what
Felicity's intentions were

704
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,715
or why she reached
out to you.

705
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,680
Following this lead
means taking a risk.

706
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,873
I don't know what happened to
Felicity these past few years,

707
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,080
but what I do know is there was
a time when all of us loved her.

708
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,796
Isn't finding out what really
happened worth the risk?

709
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,394
Fine. We'll start by tracking
down whoever she contacted last.

710
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,075
OK. Last call out
was to someone named...

711
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>Blackstar.</i>

712
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,553
That doesn't sound
ominous at all.

713
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,240
I swear to god,
if this gets me killed,

714
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,238
- I'm gonna murder you.
- Noted.

715
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,032
I liked you better
with pink hair.

716
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,794
You don't scare me.

717
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,873
I don't think
that's true.

718
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,670
See that camera?

719
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,433
<i>No red light.</i>

720
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,151
That means you and I
are completely alone.

721
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,158
Hmm.

722
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,832
You took my husband
from me.

723
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,754
I had to send
my son away.

724
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,434
You destroyed
my life.

725
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,759
What you gonna do
about it?

726
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,394
You don't have
the guts.

727
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,114
No. I do.

728
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,552
You see, that's
the problem.

729
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,396
I do have the guts because
you made me into this person.

730
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,790
Hmm?

731
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,639
Go ahead.

732
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,991
SweeTheart, this is
the big boys' table.

733
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,994
You should leave.

734
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,280
Felicity, don't.

735
00:40:13,281 --> 00:40:14,816
Couldn't be without me,
could you, baby?

736
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,274
I'm ending him, Laurel.

737
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,636
No. You don't want to
do this, trust me.

738
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,360
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!

739
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,631
We need him
to help Oliver.

740
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,200
What do you mean?

741
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,599
I made a deal
with the feds, a trade.

742
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,836
Diaz for your husband.

743
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,478
<i>If Oliver agrees to
assist them</i>

744
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,836
with their case
against Diaz,

745
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,959
he'll be
a free man again.

746
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,160
Oliver's coming home?

747
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Yeah.

748
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,360
How did you do it?

749
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,795
I knew the Green Arrow
was good,

750
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,360
but I didn't think
he was that good.

751
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,199
Stanley, I'm just
glad you're OK.

752
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,471
OK? I'm great!
I was this close

753
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,996
to being stuck in here
for the rest of my life.

754
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,674
If you hadn't found
Turner's Blade,

755
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,240
it would have been
all over for me.

756
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,320
How'd you know it was
Turner's Blade?

757
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,592
- What do you mean?
- You were in the hole, Stanley,

758
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,317
so how'd you know
it was Turner's Blade?

759
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,515
I guess I must have
heard it somewhere.

760
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,430
You gonna eat that?

761
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,839
Greg, move your head.
