1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,925
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,004
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,401
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,008
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,767
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,768
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,927
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,690
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,762
Who's Blood?

10
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:33,312
A Glades alderman
trying to save the city.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,560
- Surprised you wanted to meet.
- I'm not your enemy.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,648
- You're not a friend.
- Hoping to prove I am.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,161
He told me to stay out of the Glades.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,931
Tommy was only there
because I was too stubborn.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,806
You were right. I was blaming the Arrow
because it's all my fault, Dad.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,489
It's all my fault that Tommy died.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,249
Something's going on with this woman.
She keeps following you.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,482
- We've got to find her.
- To stop her?

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,007
- That depends.
- On what?

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,805
What side she's on.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,121
Mr. Queen's gonna be late. He's
extremely sorry. It couldn't be helped.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,129
- Where is he?
- Um...

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,888
- Over there!
- Where, man?

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,650
Right there, man!

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,162
Just got a little held up.
You know, tying up some loose ends.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,450
Agh!

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,884
I'm actually in direct contact
with him now. Let me check.

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,889
Where are you getting the guns?

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,724
Are you gonna kill me?

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,769
Get it over with already.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,485
Dig.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,114
Took down two more gangbangers.

33
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,868
They were armed with fully
automatic M4A1 assault rifles.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,045
M4A1s are military-grade weapons.
Stolen, most likely.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,326
Stolen from where?

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,642
Well, we can look
into that after your party.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,490
What party?

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,251
He's here.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,444
Sorry I'm late.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,201
This party is to attract investors
for your failing company.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,807
Being fashionably late might do well
for the club circuit...

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,129
but it does not inspire confidence
on Wall Street.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,288
- Is that blood on your face?
- Hm?

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,403
Don't worry. It's not his blood.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,446
Of course, it's his blood. Why would
he have somebody else's blood on his face?

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,531
Who taught you to shave, mister?

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,364
What kept you? Was it our
masked blond that carries

48
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,553
that giant staff to beat the
sauce out of attackers?

49
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,046
This time it was guns.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,887
- We were just talking about guns.
- Hey...

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,844
- Oliver.
- Hi.

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,726
- What's your interest in guns, Mr. Queen?
- Never touch them myself.

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,082
The gun epidemic in the Glades has
gotten increasingly out of control.

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,130
Which is why the DA's office has
committed to ending gun violence.

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,819
Well, I'm sure the police
are doing whatever they can

56
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,111
to catch whoever's bringing
the weapons into this city.

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,006
Heh.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,962
Did I say something funny?

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,609
They know who's been arming
the gangs, Oliver.

60
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,485
The Mayor.

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,405
I thought the hood copycats
killed the mayor.

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,001
Not the actual mayor.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,407
A local gang lord calls himself the Mayor.

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,284
He thinks he's the man to save our city.

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,787
But that position has already
been filled, isn't it?

66
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:24,812
Heh.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,450
Now, this Mayor has only one goal:

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,968
To create chaos, so he can rule the Glades
at the barrel of a gun.

69
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,086
You are noticeably unarmed, son.

70
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,285
Sorry, Mr. Mayor. We ran into
the vigilante, you know.

71
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,484
- He ganked our weapons.
- Do you know who I was before the quake?

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,206
I was no one. I had no name.

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,448
None that mattered anyway.
I was just a...

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,246
Just another weak man
waiting to get fired...

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,727
or evicted or killed.

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,371
But then the ground shook.

77
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,042
And now I matter because I know
the guy with the biggest gun wins.

78
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,208
And that's why I will rule the Glades.

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,985
But there's no room at my table
for weak-ass punks like you.

80
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,010
Come on, man.

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,122
Mr. Mayor, I wanna ask for leniency.

82
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,284
The kid's my cousin. I brought him in.

83
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,325
Oh, you did?

84
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,243
Now, let's hope you do your family
prouder than he did.

85
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,602
Hey.

86
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,046
Please don't ask me if I'm okay, because I'm
sick to death of everyone asking me that.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,810
- I would never do that.
- Good.

88
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,570
You okay?

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,403
The Dollmaker was just your garden-variety
traumatic experience.

90
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,721
After the quake and Tommy...

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,969
- I should be used to that by now.
- I've had a few of those.

92
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,610
You never get used to them.

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,007
Excuse me, Oliver,
may I talk to you a second?

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,929
- It's urgent.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,444
You can have him back in a minute.

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,965
Excuse us.

97
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,086
I just realized something.

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,124
What if our masked friend that keeps showing
up everywhere you go, you know her...

99
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,111
What about her?

100
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:35,507
What if we've been going
about this the wrong way?

101
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,723
We thought she was obsessed
with you, I mean, she

102
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,789
showed up at the DA's
office when you were there.

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,524
And in the chemical plant
the Dollmaker was holed up in.

104
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,727
But who else was at both those places?

105
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,168
What if our masked friend
isn't following you?

106
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,409
She's following Laurel.

107
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,327
Agh!

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,685
Does it get any louder?

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,324
Why are you following Laurel Lance?

110
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,170
I could ask the same thing of you.

111
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,443
I guess some things never change.

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,602
You and her. Always and forever.

113
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,042
- Who are you?
- Once you know...

114
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,686
- your life will never be the same.
- I can take it.

115
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,724
Not this time, Ollie.

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,730
Laurel's gonna kill me.

117
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,365
Sara!

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,684
Sara?

119
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,363
I'll give you some time to let it sink in.

120
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,724
Sara Lance.

121
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,729
Laurel's sister, the detective's
other daughter. The one that...

122
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,849
you took on the Gambit with you,
even though you were dating

123
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:08,545
Laurel at the time, which
we never talk about, but...

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,563
I'm sorry, it's just...

125
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,567
Isn't she... Isn't she dead?

126
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,441
You told everyone that she died when
the Gambit went down, that she drowned.

127
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,804
You lied.

128
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,691
When the Gambit capsized, uh...

129
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,369
Sara was pulled under.

130
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,484
It was so dark and cold...

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,441
and I thought she drowned.

132
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,201
About a year later, I saw her.

133
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,325
You saw her where? On the island?
She drifted to the island too?

134
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
Not exactly.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,765
Why didn't you tell the Lances
that she didn't die on that boat?

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,764
Laurel and Mr. Lance, they blame you.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,650
It was my fault.

138
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,206
What happened was my fault.

139
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,689
- Where has she been all these years?
- I don't know.

140
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,921
Diggle, I swear to God.

141
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,848
I was sure she was dead.

142
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,537
Do you have any happy stories?

143
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:11,706
Alright, just to make sure I
understand this correctly...

144
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,441
after not drowning
when the Gambit went down...

145
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,008
Sara didn't exactly make it
to the island with you...

146
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,325
where you would see her die yet again.
Feel free to fill in the blanks.

147
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,249
- Not right now.
- You mean not ever, don't you Oliver?

148
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,444
Don't you think her family had a right to
know that she made it to the island too?

149
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,850
These were five years!
Five years...

150
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,000
where nothing good happened...

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,685
and they were better off not knowing.

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,564
Do they deserve to know now?

153
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,450
I need to take care of some business
at the office.

154
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,446
- Where are we with the Mayor?
- I am in contact...

155
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,404
with some of my military sources.

156
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,047
Trying to get a line on how he's getting
his illegal Army weaponry.

157
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,850
I'll keep you updated.

158
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,211
You know, Oliver, somebody once told me...

159
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,530
that secrets have weight.

160
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,610
The more you keep,
the harder it is to keep moving.

161
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,888
You see how hard I work out.

162
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,560
You killed two of my crew.

163
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,640
How many others are with you
on the island?

164
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,171
What are your weapon capabilities?

165
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,281
Did you find the graves?

166
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,561
Two things will happen.

167
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,970
You will tell me everything I want to know.
Then I will kill you.

168
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,483
Or I will torture you until you tell me
everything I want to know.

169
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,921
And then I will kill you.

170
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,925
- Go to hell.
- Can't.

171
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,050
We're already there.

172
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,967
Told you.

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,686
Patty Shack on 5th and Brewer.
Best burgers in town.

174
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,884
Well, Patty Shack's
in the Mayor's territory...

175
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,966
so I'll take a subpar breakfast
over a bullet.

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,484
What's wrong?

177
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,602
Look, I know I'm skinny, but I can eat
two of these, and I will.

178
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,200
I just ran into an old boyfriend.

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,806
Just...

180
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,999
I'm worried that he might
tell my family that I'm back.

181
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:17,390
You have family in Starling?

182
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,567
Yeah.

183
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,842
My father, he's...

184
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,003
He's a policeman.

185
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,884
And my sister, she's a lawyer.

186
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,050
Well, they must be real proud
of their masked delinquent.

187
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,287
- Yeah, they think I'm dead.
- Oh, cool.

188
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,086
My folks think I'm dead too.

189
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,847
That or they wish I'd never been born.
One of those.

190
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,720
Why don't you want them to know
that you're still alive?

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,843
Because I'm not what they remember.

192
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,566
Good little Daddy's girl?

193
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,210
Far from it.

194
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,207
I was a lot like you.

195
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,247
Is that why you saved me
from those guys that night?

196
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,202
No woman should ever suffer
at the hands of men.

197
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,449
We've gotta stop meeting like this.

198
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,236
What would your
girlfriend think, Johnnie?

199
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:19,792
Heh.

200
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,486
Lyla, I'm checking the box
marked "single" these days.

201
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,047
- Sorry to hear it. What happened?
- Mm.

202
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,408
Well, another man came between us.

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,644
Deadshot.

204
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,480
You're getting in the bad habit
of letting him ruin your life.

205
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,130
So I've been repeatedly told.

206
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,203
Anything on those stolen Army weapons?

207
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,563
A crate of twelve M4A1s went missing
from Camp Kirby two months ago.

208
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,926
Yeah, I think I know where they went.

209
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,203
Every crate was fitted with a GPS system
so they could be remote tracked.

210
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,889
I tried pulling it but it's not receiving.
Must have been deactivated.

211
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,367
- Thank, Lyla.
- And your interest in this is what?

212
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,209
Lyla, you and I went to Afghanistan...

213
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,530
to try to bring law and order to a country
overrun by warlords and weapons, right?

214
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,241
Should we do any less for our own cities?

215
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,290
Thanks again.

216
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,970
- Hey, Johnnie.
- Yeah?

217
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,080
These days
I check the box marked "single" too.

218
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,847
Mr. Blood.

219
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,806
- I see you've met Ms. Rochev. She's my...
- Superior.

220
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,451
- Partner.
- On paper.

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,241
Is that why you asked me to come down here,
Mr. Queen? To mediate your job title?

222
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,766
You and I have gotten off
on the wrong foot repeatedly.

223
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,371
Seems to be your superpower.

224
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,886
I was inspired by what you said the other
night about gun violence in the Glades.

225
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,563
- And I had an idea that might help.
- Really?

226
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,967
- Another party at your stately manor?
- No.

227
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,049
I wanted to sponsor a Cash for Guns event.

228
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,801
I give you the money and you get
your constituents to lay down their arms.

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,809
Everybody wins.

230
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,644
Especially you.

231
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,850
Trying to repair your family's tainted name
by ridding the Glades of guns.

232
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,481
You just get the money, Mr. Blood.

233
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,524
- I don't want my family's name involved.
- Mr. Queen...

234
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,927
may I have a word with you?

235
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,366
Let me think it over.

236
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,161
- We are not sponsoring that event.
- I know.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,526
- I am.
- With what money?

238
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,771
Your investment party cost QC 50 grand
and no one invested a dime.

239
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,851
I will not continue to authorize corporate
funds just so you can keep pretending...

240
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,326
that you are the CEO.

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,526
Fine. I'll pay for it myself.

242
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,142
Heh, maybe you haven't noticed,

243
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,948
but your personal trust isn't
exactly what it used to be.

244
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,565
And this company isn't either.

245
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,807
As much as I would love
to make the city safer...

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,721
my first obligation is to
Queen Consolidated.

247
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,123
And yours is too.

248
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,046
Shadows settle on the place
That you left

249
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,282
I was gonna order some takeout.
You want in?

250
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,242
- I appreciate the offer, Adam...
- I've eaten takeout every night this week.

251
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,767
I need a meal served on
an actual plate. So do you.

252
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,521
I get it.

253
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,326
It's easy to let the job become your life.

254
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,730
I keep having to remind myself to go to
the gym, see a movie, eat a good meal.

255
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,290
That sounds dangerously like having a life.

256
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,047
Ha, ha. What about you?
You can't be all about work.

257
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,285
- I'm the best me when I am working.
- And when you're not?

258
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,482
You don't want to meet her.

259
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,450
She's not good company.

260
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,841
I'd be willing to risk it.

261
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,609
Excuse me.

262
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,926
I just remembered.

263
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,407
- I have to go.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

264
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,683
No. It's okay. It's fine.

265
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,844
I just have to go.

266
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,450
- Good night.
- Good night.

267
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,645
Crap.

268
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,607
- License and registration.
- Is there a problem, officer?

269
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,281
Have you had anything
to drink tonight, ma'am?

270
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,081
I'm Laurel Lance.
I'm an assistant district attorney.

271
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,171
I'm sorry, Ms. Lance, but I'm gonna have
to ask you to step out of the car, please.

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,048
I need some good news.

273
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,369
The bad news first.
Somehow, the Mayor did get his hands...

274
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,962
on a crate of military-grade weapons
from Camp Kirby.

275
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,761
- The good news?
- If he kept the crate...

276
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,840
we might be able to find
out where he's hiding.

277
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,877
This is the same making
model of a tracking system

278
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:06,743
the Army installs on all
of its weapons crates.

279
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,687
If they lose a crate, they send out
a remote signal that activates the beacon.

280
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,681
Mayor's clever. He deactivated his beacon.
Send a signal, nothing comes back.

281
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,646
You both need to work
on your definition of "good news."

282
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,488
Okay. How's this? Guess which company
designed the tracking system the Army uses.

283
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,968
I'll give you a hint.
Their CEO? Always late.

284
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,364
Nice.

285
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,767
I pulled up the original plans
from the QC mainframe.

286
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,206
There's a design flaw.

287
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,291
The beacon is still susceptible to
a subform wave even if it's deactivated.

288
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,802
The Mayor turned it off, Oliver.
We can turn it back on.

289
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,681
I believe you ordered the crate of
stolen military weapons, Mr. Queen.

290
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,727
I thought you deactivated the tracker.

291
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,047
Cover me.

292
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,127
Come on.

293
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,010
- Weapons are secure.
- And the Mayor?

294
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,044
Still in office.

295
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,363
Thanks for the heads up, Officer Daily.

296
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,524
Just FYI...

297
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,961
she blew 0.6 past the legal limit.

298
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,767
Thanks.

299
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,522
He didn't need to call you.

300
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,969
No, but you're lucky he did.

301
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,648
You could have lost your job, your license.

302
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,283
- You could have killed somebody.
- I had a few too many glasses of wine.

303
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,121
- It was an accident.
- An accident? Well, I guess those happen.

304
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,482
Was I not supposed to notice that tone?

305
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,805
Between the two of us,
you get a lot from me, Laurel.

306
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,645
Maybe you got this too.

307
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,328
We can hardly compare my one mistake
to your drinking problem.

308
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,126
So long as it is only one mistake.

309
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,121
I don't know if you've noticed...

310
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,920
but I've had a little bit
of a hard time lately.

311
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,483
I was kidnapped, nearly murdered
by a psychopath and my boyfriend died.

312
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,770
So, I don't know, maybe cut me some slack.

313
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,848
When I started having a hard time,
I wish people had not cut me slack.

314
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,448
Leave your car here. I'm driving you home.

315
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,250
- I'll take a cab.
- Laurel.

316
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,010
Laurel!

317
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,722
- Did you tell my family that I'm alive?
- No.

318
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,369
Sara...

319
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,246
I saw you die.

320
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,689
Not the first time that's happened. Right?

321
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,803
I thought you were dead too.

322
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,646
What happened to Slade?

323
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,690
Where have you been?

324
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,002
- Everywhere.
- That's not an answer.

325
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,487
Well, it's the one you're getting.

326
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,922
About a year ago...

327
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,404
I started hearing tales
of the Starling City Vigilante.

328
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,922
The man in the green hood.

329
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,571
I knew it was you.

330
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,683
I've never known you to be a fighter.

331
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,043
- Where'd you pick that up?
- I met some rough people.

332
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,851
- Thought I should get rougher too...
- Sara...

333
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,166
why did you come back?

334
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,442
The earthquake.

335
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,729
Because you wanted to make sure
your family was safe.

336
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,685
But now you're still here,
watching over them.

337
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,206
Protecting them. So did you come here...

338
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,444
to make sure I didn't tell them?

339
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,760
Or because you were hoping I had?

340
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,809
I'll get rid of them.

341
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,408
- Mr. Lance?
- Hi.

342
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,442
Something I can help you with?

343
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,088
I'm here about my daughter.

344
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,410
Laurel.

345
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,968
- Is she okay?
- Yeah. Well, no, she's not.

346
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,162
She got pulled over for a DUI last night.

347
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,442
I tried talking to her about it,
but she wasn't hearing me.

348
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,169
Ah, I saw her the other night. She...

349
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,331
didn't seem like herself.

350
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,729
I know. She seems like me.

351
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,006
I don't know if you know...

352
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,086
but when you and Sara disappeared...

353
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,249
I hit the bottle pretty hard.

354
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,761
I know the two of you are friends.

355
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,043
She needs a friend.

356
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,249
Maybe talk to her.

357
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,886
Sure.

358
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,360
Anyhow.

359
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,204
- Mr. Lance.
- Yeah.

360
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,604
Um...

361
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,288
I'd be happy to talk to Laurel.

362
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,523
Thanks.

363
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,890
Ugh.

364
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,607
Why...? Unh.

365
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,847
Wh...?

366
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,480
Why'd they do this? Unh.

367
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,567
They make all of us do this.

368
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,250
It's for to show prochnost.

369
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,849
It's Russian for "strength."

370
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,288
They did this to see if I'm strong?

371
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,364
They're doing this to see if you survive.

372
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,125
Living...

373
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,521
is not for the weak.

374
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,922
- Oliver, hi.
- Hey.

375
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,052
What are you doing here?
Is everything okay?

376
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,113
I don't know. ls
everything okay?

377
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,891
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me.

378
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,645
My dad went to you?

379
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,208
He spent the last six years cursing
your name. Now you're gossip buddies?

380
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,920
Laurel, he's worried about you.

381
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,009
Perfect.

382
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,011
A recovering alcoholic and former party boy
trying to tell me how to live my life.

383
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,561
- Don't you see the hypocrisy there?
- What I see...

384
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,651
is somebody that both of us care for...

385
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,410
having a rough go of it.

386
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,563
Do you know how many times
I've had to pull my dad out of a bar?

387
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,084
Or how many nights I've had to drive him
home while he's passed out in my backseat?

388
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,442
He's the one with the problem.

389
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,924
Not me.

390
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,166
Just because he can't cope with losing Sara
doesn't mean I can't handle my life.

391
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,763
Feel free to tell him that
during your next chitchat.

392
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,767
Sewing is not your strong suit.

393
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,090
Now we can talk.

394
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,123
For two years...

395
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,041
my crew and I have been looking
for a gravesite.

396
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,807
Did you find the graves?

397
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,771
Were the bodies...

398
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,651
odd?

399
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,005
The bones...

400
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,480
misshapen?

401
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,009
This is the right island.

402
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,049
Looks like we got a Colt 1911

403
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,529
Jennings .32 and a K-Frame revolver.

404
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,924
- We'll give you 250 for the lot.
- Keep it.

405
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,487
Do I even wanna know
where you got those guns?

406
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,047
They're from the old days. I told you.

407
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,164
Look, no more being a criminal.
No more being a hero.

408
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,085
I'm just Roy Harper,
busboy and boyfriend.

409
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,962
Yo, Abercrombie.

410
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,684
- Where's your manners?
- Sin.

411
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,207
This is Thea. Thea, this is Sin.

412
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,041
Thea Queen?
Look at you rolling with royalty.

413
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,719
By the way, the salad
fork's the small one.

414
00:29:00,744 --> 00:29:02,350
It was good to see you again.

415
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,008
She doesn't know you're the Vigilante's
delivery boy, does she?

416
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,082
- Nice to meet you, Your Highness.
- You too.

417
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,521
- So, how do you know her?
- From around.

418
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,126
You don't show up when you say you will...

419
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,806
and when you promise not to,
here you are.

420
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,965
- Going well?
- Last check...

421
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,329
we've taken in over 200 guns
in only three hours.

422
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,684
Try not to look so happy about it.

423
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,287
A lot on my mind, alderman.

424
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,685
My job is to help the people in this city
with their problems.

425
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,328
Two people that are very important to me...

426
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,202
are having a tough time.
Sisters, actually.

427
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,967
And neither one is making it
very easy for me to help them.

428
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,361
Sooner or later, we all
go through a crucible.

429
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,527
I'm guessing yours was that island.

430
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,646
Most believe there are two types of people
who go into a crucible:

431
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,570
The ones who grow stronger
from the experience and survive it...

432
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,046
and the ones who die.

433
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,644
But there's a third type:

434
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,441
The ones who learn to love the fire.
They choose to stay in their crucible...

435
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,167
because it's easier to embrace the pain
when it's all you know anymore.

436
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,327
That's why I'm on the clock
to help this city...

437
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,254
before it becomes used
to living like this.

438
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,865
"Living is not for the weak."

439
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,529
- An old friend of mine once told me that.
- That's a wise friend.

440
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,085
Yeah.

441
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,771
Listen up, people.
This is your Mayor speaking.

442
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,846
Now, I don't recall this here event
being sanctioned.

443
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,961
What happens in the Glades
only happens if I allow it.

444
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,084
You're not the leader of this community!

445
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,324
You don't speak for these people!

446
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,167
And neither do you. Not anymore.

447
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,529
Hey. Are you okay? Are you hit?

448
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,801
No.

449
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,041
- Hey, Sin, you all right?
- All's good.

450
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,603
Go get help. Go!

451
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,562
The shooting was committed by the gang
leader known only as the Mayor...

452
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,451
who, until now, has never
been seen in public.

453
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,849
We do want to warn our audience
that some of these images are graphic.

454
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,528
Coward finally decided to show his face.

455
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
Vanity is gonna cost him.

456
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,767
I borrowed the FBI's
facial recognition software.

457
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,531
Got a match. Xavier Reed.

458
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,362
- Did Mr. Reed serve in the military?
- No military history.

459
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,681
Family members?

460
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,930
Reed was in and out of foster care
his whole life. Wait, hold on.

461
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,369
In 1996, Reed spent three years
with a foster family...

462
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,170
and their son, Ezra Barnes.

463
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,687
He served three tours in Iraq.
He's Stateside now.

464
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,360
- Twenty bucks says he was at Camp Kirby.
- Pay the man.

465
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,609
The Mayor's foster brother is assigned
to a weapons convoy...

466
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,729
that carries SCAR 16s by truck.

467
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,406
The convoy's scheduled to come
through here tonight.

468
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,730
FN SCAR 16s are military assault weapons
with grenade launchers.

469
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,407
The Mayor gets a hold of these, Oliver,
it's game over.

470
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,563
He won't.

471
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,927
Bullet penetrated her anterior abdomen.

472
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,370
We were able to remove most of the
fragments. We'll know more in a few hours.

473
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,082
Hey. I'm gonna stick around
in case she wakes up.

474
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,443
Is it okay if I stick around with you?

475
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,851
You saved her life, Roy.

476
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,489
Guess you can't stop being a hero, can you?

477
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,169
I wanna see how you do in a real fight.

478
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,407
Good. I was looking for a fight.

479
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,170
They're with me.

480
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,646
He wasn't.

481
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,010
You're done being all you can be.

482
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,604
- Ahh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

483
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,842
You and I are gonna own this town.

484
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,686
Now, let's see what this bad boy can do.

485
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,168
Load up the weapons. Now!

486
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,043
- Behind you.
- Old school weapon. Respect!

487
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,885
But can your arrows do this?

488
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,204
Come on. Where are you?

489
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,602
- You hurt a friend of mine.
- Let him go.

490
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,562
- You can't save a city with forgiveness.
- You don't have to forgive him.

491
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,602
But you do have to let him live.

492
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,408
Bitch. Knew you didn't have it in you.

493
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,368
Agh! Oof.

494
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,651
I really don't like that word.

495
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,407
Demonstrations opposing the construction...

496
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,640
of the new S.T.A.R. Lab's
particle accelerator...

497
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,367
have reached a fever pitch
with five more protesters being arrested.

498
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,689
In other news, the recent Cash for Guns
event held in the Glades...

499
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,770
is credited for getting
over 800 weapons off the streets.

500
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,441
Still a mystery, the anonymous donor...

501
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,967
whose generous donation
funded the event.

502
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,405
I guess it's true what they say.

503
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,082
- One man can change the world.
- I'll leave changing the world to you.

504
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,124
I'm only in the world because of you.
Thank you.

505
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,445
I was just acting on instinct.

506
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,287
It wasn't instinct. It was strength.

507
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,611
I see the signs, the graffiti.

508
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,290
"Blood for mayor."

509
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,121
Now that the Mayor is in jail,
maybe you should run.

510
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,131
There is more than one way to save a city.

511
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,529
- Mr. Harper.
- What's wrong? Is she okay?

512
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,086
Hi.

513
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,251
You saved my life.

514
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,321
Guess I have to keep your secret now, huh?

515
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,445
- You know you're dating a moron, right?
- Heh.

516
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,080
It's my first and last
thought of every day.

517
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,361
Crap.

518
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,366
I like her.

519
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,321
Your friend,
I took care of her medical expenses.

520
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,890
Thank you.

521
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,366
- Look, I don't want Thea to see...
- What's your plan, Sara?

522
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,322
Because right now you're just...

523
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,928
You're whipping across rooftops
and keeping watch over your family...

524
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,522
- like some sort of ghost.
- We're both ghosts.

525
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,564
- We died on that island...
- No, we didn't.

526
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,570
We both lived.

527
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,131
And...

528
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,566
I get that you have
been in pain so long...

529
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,445
that it probably just feels normal now.

530
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,928
You can let it go and come home.

531
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,926
I know that the earthquake brought you
here, but your family kept you here.

532
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,489
You have to tell them, Sara.

533
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,969
They need you.

534
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,803
You told them that I died on the Gambit.

535
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,610
- If they know the truth...
- They would never...

536
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,723
They would never talk to me again.

537
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,689
Not one of them.

538
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,170
It'd be worth it.

539
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,200
My daughter's in trouble.

540
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,050
She's, uh... She's been through some really
terrible things.

541
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,769
And...

542
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,443
instead of facing up to them,
she's running away from them.

543
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,131
She's losing herself in her work...

544
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,081
and maybe even worse.

545
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,920
She's my daughter. I just want her safe.
I want to protect her.

546
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,727
I guess, like we say in our meetings,
"More will be revealed."

547
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,245
Your days of screaming are just beginning.

548
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,967
How...?

549
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,723
What the hell is this?

550
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,929
This ain't the police station.

551
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,131
Hello, brother.

552
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,806
Are you ready to serve?

553
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,843
Why you wearing that mask?

554
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,482
This city is in chains and
I'm going to free it.

555
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,283
But to do that I need an army.
An army of the strong.

556
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,686
What's in that thing?

557
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,331
A miracle.

558
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,931
Get that off me.

559
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,886
Get that crap away from me!

560
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,647
Are you ready to serve?

561
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,125
Bring me another.

562
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,844
Yes, Brother Blood.
