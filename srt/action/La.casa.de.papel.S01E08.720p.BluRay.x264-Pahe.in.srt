1
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:06,801
You're asking me to let you in.

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,961
You choose; either I send you the tanks
or we have a coffee you and me

3
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:12,281
and you show me all the hostages alive.

4
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,121
I'd be delighted to receive you.

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,481
- Raise your hands.
Proceed.

6
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:28,041
- Hannibal Cortés is the weakest
link in the chain.

7
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,761
That's why I told Scientists

8
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:31,481
to place a message inside.

9
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:34,001
- Hello, son. We've hired a
very good lawyer

10
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,841
and I've got you a collaboration act with justice.

11
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,521
- You can still back up, sweetheart.

12
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:40,961
- If Aníbal Cortés surrender,

13
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,281
It will mean that our plan works.

14
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:46,121
- Do you work near here?
Yes, right next door.

15
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,081
Like Raquel told me she was unemployed.

16
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,081
It's just that a few months ago I lost my job,

17
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:53,081
so now I'm trying to set up my own company.

18
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:55,681
Ecological cider.
And you have the workshop nearby?

19
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:58,121
Yes, right here, very close.
I would love to try it.

20
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,921
Sorry to intrude, but I can't wait
to try that cider

21
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,441
that you promised me.
Of course, right now.

22
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,001
Thank you.
Cheers.

23
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,001
What, did you find something?
- Yes, there was a print.

24
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:15,641
It doesn't match the cops who patrol it.

25
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:18,641
- Do me a favour,
Check it with the prints on this spoon.

26
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,641
When you get the results, call me.

27
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:23,441
- I search you, almost arrest you,
and you still care about me?

28
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:26,161
Well, if you need any kind of help
that I can...

29
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,361
Thank you.

30
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,001
- I've given you approximation points,

31
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,921
so I don't have to sew again.
Better.

32
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:37,921
What if I could go where I was
before to rest and stuff?

33
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,921
Retroxil, used to alleviate tremors

34
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,721
of a rare degenerative neuronal disease.

35
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,041
- You have to order it on request,

36
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,321
they have all patients very localized.

37
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,601
- But in Toledo there has been an
unusual demand.

38
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:53,521
- And where was the last purchase made?

39
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,441
- Here, in Palomeque, on October 18th.

40
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,721
- Just three days before entering the Factory.

41
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,921
Get a warrant from Judge Andrade.

42
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:03,201
and go to that pharmacy by yourself.
Don't talk about this with anyone.

43
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,801
Help, please, we just got mugged!

44
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:08,801
He just wanted the purchase
records without prescriptions

45
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,121
and sales books as well.

46
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:56,521
Raquel, I don't know.

47
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:59,241
The pharmacy was robbed,
all records were taken.

48
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:02,601
I don't know how this happened.
Only you and I knew, you and me!

49
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,521
"Do you know that moment when you tie
up loose ends

50
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,681
that you didn't want to tie up?
It hurts, doesn't it?

51
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,641
You're there, with your usual partner,
and you think:

52
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,121
"What a son of a bitch."

53
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,241
I'm on my way.

54
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:19,041
"Or: 'What a bastard'.

55
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,201
You don't want to believe it,
but you know there's a traitor.

56
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,681
And it can only be you or your partner.

57
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,561
And Ángel knew he wasn't.

58
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:33,241
Raquel was trying to find an explanation
for that robbery,

59
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:36,481
but when explanations don't come alone,

60
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,321
there's always someone willing to
give you a little push."

61
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:41,561
I'm an old fashioned and
I still believe in good and bad.

62
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,361
And I put my hand on the fire
that you are one of the good ones.

63
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:49,521
Could you put your hand on the fire
for your sub-inspector?

64
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,081
Because I wouldn't put someone else's dick.

65
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,561
"Ángel believed that nothing could get worse.

66
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,001
But it could.

67
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,441
Of course it could.

68
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:14,361
When you hit the bottom,

69
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:17,641
you still have something to scratch
into the abyss."

70
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,241
Dirt!

71
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,721
What's going on?

72
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,121
What's going on?

73
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,001
- We got it!

74
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:59,241
"Not even Sunday night had fallen,

75
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:01,241
when we were invaded by a climate of euphoria.

76
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:05,081
We had found dirt and Nairobi
had the presses

77
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,601
in full power.

78
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,281
We had exceeded 400 million euros."

79
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,801
"We had sealed the entrances
with explosive charges

80
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,041
and we had the feeling of being in a bunker.

81
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,881
It was our ten minutes of glory."

82
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,001
Who the fuck wants the sound of the sea?
This is poetry.

83
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,441
This is the heart of the world
beating here,

84
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,281
beating for us, because we're making it beat.

85
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,241
Because the world moves
because of this, damn it!

86
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,241
- What's going on? What party are you
having here? What's going on?

87
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,201
- Hey, hey, hey!

88
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,361
What's the matter with you?

89
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,441
Viva!

90
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:37,121
"Without a doubt, it was the happiest
moment we were in there.

91
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,481
And then, we relax."

92
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,161
Hold still.

93
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:04,881
- Do you want to comb your hair?

94
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:07,361
Thank you.

95
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:14,881
Do you know how they say in my village
"two men make love"?

96
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:19,481
It is said: "Comb for inside".

97
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,641
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:34,881
I'm sorry. With so much medicine,
my stomach is loose.

99
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,641
Could you go to the bathroom, please?
Sure, man.

100
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:53,721
Jacinto.

101
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,841
Jacinto, this is Arturo.
Do you hear me?

102
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,401
Jacinto!

103
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,561
Mister Arturo.

104
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,281
You're alive!

105
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,801
I was convinced you'd been shot.

106
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,601
I didn't sleep.

107
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,801
We are in the boilers basement.

108
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,161
Tied up like dogs.

109
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:23,481
We've been locked up with four cops.

110
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,761
They just take us upstairs to go to
the bathroom.

111
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:31,121
Listen to me, Jacinto,
I have scissors

112
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,121
and I can get you more tools

113
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,241
Screwdrivers, a saw...
I don't know.

114
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,561
Tools I can get you in two hours.

115
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:39,121
Do you have a watch?
Yes.

116
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,441
Find yourself an excuse.

117
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:43,481
Try to get you back here in two hours.
Two hours.

118
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:46,321
From this moment on.
Remember, second from the left.

119
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,081
I'll leave the tools here.

120
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,921
What the fuck do you want us to do
with scissors and a saw?

121
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,761
These people have explosives,
M-16, everything.

122
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:59,201
The lives of 67 people are in your hands.

123
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:05,521
Believe me, everything's gonna be fine
and in a few hours we'll be out

124
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:08,361
of this nightmare.
All right.

125
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,001
Yes, yes,
I'll be right out.

126
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,841
The photos sent by the kidnappers

127
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:32,641
show explosive charges connected
to photoelectric cells.

128
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,121
They've been placed in all the entrances.

129
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,161
Even in the underground ventilation.

130
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:43,081
- What explosive is it?
- The Tedax think it is C4.

131
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,561
But I see it much more orange,

132
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,561
so we've sent it to CSI for verification.

133
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,841
- Who at CSI?

134
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,921
- We sent it to Alberto.

135
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,641
- Okay. Isn't there another inspector
in the entire CSI

136
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,961
who can do the same job as my ex-husband?

137
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:02,641
- Inspector, they gave it to Alberto
because he's the best.

138
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:04,961
- This is a direct order
from Commissioner Sánchez.

139
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:07,321
- Yeah.

140
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,001
And what does the CSI say?

141
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:11,401
- They think it's P-4.
Very similar to C-4,

142
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:14,521
of British origin,
and that the connection is perfect.

143
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,801
- They're making it hard for us, huh?

144
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,761
Alison!

145
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,361
I think it's time to have a friendly chat

146
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,121
with Alison Parker.

147
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,641
Colonel.

148
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:00,761
- A cell phone call is coming
in from inside the building.

149
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,041
- Record it!

150
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:08,281
- It's from Yum Li, a hostage.

151
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,841
- I am Aníbal Cortés.

152
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:16,561
What do you want?

153
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:19,761
- To help you, Hannibal.

154
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:24,121
For that we need you to help us
get into the factory

155
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:28,721
and get the hostages out in the least
aggressive way possible. Understand?

156
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,361
- There are plastic explosives at
all access points.

157
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,801
- Yes, it is.

158
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:41,321
Entering is not a problem,
but we need an ally.

159
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:43,841
An ally to tell us where
the robbers are

160
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,641
at every moment,
do you understand?

161
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,801
- Yeah. And why would I sell
my colleagues?

162
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:52,481
They'll tempt you with a better future,
with sentencing benefits,

163
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,001
that in one or two years you'll be out...
No.

164
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:58,201
If you help us, you'll get prison benefits.

165
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,201
A reduction of your sentence
to two years.

166
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,761
When you're 22,
you'll have a future again.

167
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:05,121
Think about it.

168
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,801
Divide and conquer.
This slogan served a small town in Italy

169
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:15,121
to dominate the whole world.

170
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:17,161
Then it served to Napoleon.

171
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,081
And now it serves the National Police.

172
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:28,561
They will take advantage of the slightest
contact to tempt any of you.

173
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:37,121
When you've been in there for more than 48 hours,
the pressure will start,

174
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:40,041
anguish, negativity

175
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:43,921
and that's when they try to go
for the weakest link.

176
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:50,001
The weakness isn't in us,
it's in what we have outside.

177
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,961
You can still back up,
sweetheart.

178
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,201
But by the time they try to contact,

179
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:59,041
you have already committed at least
six or eight crimes.

180
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:02,921
No judge is going to guarantee
your freedom. None.

181
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,641
Once you're in there, the only one
who can offer you freedom...

182
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,001
it's me.

183
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,001
- Hannibal,
listen to me carefully.

184
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:18,041
The judge guarantees you freedom
in a very short time.

185
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,561
- Okay.
Let's do the math, Inspector.

186
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:33,041
Look, robbery with violence: 2 to 5 years.

187
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,441
Crime against freedom, kidnapping

188
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:38,041
and establishment of conditions for release

189
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,721
of the four policemen in the convoy: 40 years.

190
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,121
Checking the alarms.
Computer crime.

191
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:46,001
We're talking six months to two years.

192
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:49,281
Disturbance of public order due to
the assault on the factory:

193
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:50,801
from 1 to 6 years old.

194
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:53,361
And with the hostages, it's much harder.

195
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:56,161
67 hostages. And the Penal Code says

196
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:59,641
which are 6 to 10 years for each
of the kidnappings.

197
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:03,161
Then the shots to the police at point-blank
range on the first day.

198
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,441
From 6 to 8 years for each agent.

199
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,281
But on top of that we wounded them,

200
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,121
which leads to a felony for injuries

201
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:13,001
and an aggravating factor of up to 8 years
for each agent injured.

202
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:15,561
We would be talking about...

203
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:18,681
If we get a bastard judge,
723 years

204
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:22,121
of request from the prosecution.
The minimum you can offer you

205
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,561
both the judge and the prosecution itself

206
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:28,601
without wiping his ass with the Penal Code
is 173 years old.

207
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,121
So don't be fooled.
Let's see, the Penal Code

208
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,481
Is the game rules of any country.

209
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,601
No one can skip them. No one.

210
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:40,761
Although there is one thing we
can agree on.

211
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,801
The president's pardon.

212
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,921
- Tell him yes.

213
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,641
- You want me to ask the president
to sign you a pardon?

214
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,481
- No, I want you to ask the president

215
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:00,641
that will appear on all televisions and in
front of the whole of Spain say

216
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,401
that if any of the kidnappers decide
to cooperate

217
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,281
to end the crisis, the possibility
will be assessed

218
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,561
to offer him a pardon for his collaboration.

219
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,041
First the president is on the news.

220
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,921
- He's bluffing.
- And then I'll think about it

221
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:16,241
about being a sold out piece of shit.
- All right, we'll do it.

222
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:19,961
But for that we need a gesture
of goodwill from you.

223
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,321
I want you to tell me the name of The Profesor.

224
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:26,921
and the number of robbers in there.

225
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:32,601
Come on, Hannibal, give me a name
and a number.

226
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:35,681
and I assure you that you will
have a future again.

227
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:40,721
- Okay.
A name and a number.

228
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,521
Take paper and pen.

229
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:46,921
My balls. 33.

230
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:51,601
- What a son of a bitch!
Fuck...

231
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,241
- Attention, we've cut off communication
with the inside of the factory.

232
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,801
But, dude,
what the hell did you do?

233
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,761
He fucked up our chances of winning time,
that's what he did.

234
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,481
- They didn't believe it.

235
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:09,161
I was hearing fucking whispers,
for fuck's sake.

236
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,481
- But let's see,
who do you think you are?

237
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:16,401
You had to execute, not decide or
change plans, damn it.

238
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:18,001
What the fuck is that whispering?

239
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:20,041
Hey, hey, Río heard the conversation.

240
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:22,761
And if he says they didn't believe it,
that's it, ok?

241
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:25,121
We've been making that fucking
inspector dizzy for days.

242
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,481
So it's not his fault, ok?

243
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:29,841
That's it. Besides, she wasn't even going
to call the president,

244
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,761
or the TV, or her fucking mother on a bicycle.

245
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:36,241
- That's enough for you.
You assholes...

246
00:17:47,161 --> 00:17:49,001
"In spite of his brilliant interpretation,

247
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:52,321
Río knew at all times that he wanted
to take the deal,

248
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:54,441
stop time

249
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:58,881
and get out of there like none of
this ever happened."

250
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:09,601
Would you have liked to take the
deal with the cops?

251
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,601
You know this isn't gonna work out,
right?

252
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:21,241
Do you know what a reviewable
permanent prison is?

253
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,961
What awaits me.

254
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:30,401
I killed a security guard

255
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,641
and a few months later I came in here to steal.

256
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:40,281
And I shot a cop.
With all the manners you look!

257
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,241
Do you think a judge is going to believe
in my reinsertion?

258
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,401
No.

259
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,681
I trust The Profesor.

260
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,521
I fully trust him.

261
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,361
You didn't answer me.

262
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,361
Would you have liked to accept?

263
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:19,401
Anyway, what would happen if we got
out of here?

264
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,241
Were we going to stay together?

265
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:25,921
Or were you going to spend the whole time
trying to give me my badge back?

266
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,881
You're talking about betraying your friends.

267
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,561
My friends?
My friends with a city name?

268
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,801
Tokio, Berlín, Moscú, Denver.

269
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:42,161
Well, to me, my friends with city names
look awesome.

270
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:46,161
And I'll tell you something:

271
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,761
try to hide if you take the deal,

272
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,721
because if I see you,
I'll shoot you in the head.

273
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:11,161
I just got off the phone with the factory
security guard.

274
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:14,281
I found him in the bathroom.
He says they are locked up,

275
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:16,601
11 security guards and 4 policemen.

276
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:19,761
They are our only salvation.

277
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:25,641
No, I'm not hungry,
thank you.

278
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:27,521
Are you sure?
Yes, thank you.

279
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,441
Our salvation?
What if they're locked up?

280
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,761
We have to arm them anyhow,

281
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,121
get tools and pass them on.

282
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,361
But what tools do you want to steal?

283
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:46,441
Well, drill bits, hammers, screws, whatever.

284
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:49,281
You've seen they have an arsenal down there.

285
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:52,361
Well, we have to take it and hide it
in the bathroom.

286
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,801
Look, Pablo, I can't do this alone.

287
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,641
All right? I need your help.

288
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:02,721
When this one, the Slavic gorilla,
takes me down for a walk,

289
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,961
I need you to entertain him.

290
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:08,641
Yes, he has healed my wound,
he is very attentive to me,

291
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:14,241
helps me walk... And I don't know
if you've noticed, but...

292
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:19,361
It's a little gay.
Yeah, who knew!

293
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:24,881
Well, he is, so offer yourself,
he's going to want you for sure.

294
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,601
He's gonna want what?

295
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:29,001
So what's it going to be?
that, for fuck sake, that.

296
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,361
And while you seduce him and
he's with you for a while,

297
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:36,521
I sneak out and steal the tools,
okay?

298
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:40,041
Listen, everyone here has to use their weapons,
you know what I mean?

299
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:43,041
You're a fucking adonis,
so take advantage of it.

300
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,121
To save life.
Look, you are crazy. You are crazy.

301
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:49,961
What do you care?
Today all of your generation

302
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:52,921
you're half ambiguous.
Stop, huh? Stop it.

303
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:56,521
Are you saying I should be sodomized
by that orangutan?

304
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,601
Listen, here the limits are set by yourself.

305
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:03,361
If you distract him, that's fine with me.
All right?

306
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:05,521
Look, you distract him.

307
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:08,361
And I steal the tools and whatever it takes.

308
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:16,441
- That's it. It's over.
Arturo, you rest.

309
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:20,081
Take care of your wound.
I come later.

310
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:24,081
Come on. The ones in the tunnel, here.

311
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:29,201
Do not discuss the plan with anyone.
The plan is just for us.

312
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:32,001
The less we are, the better the chances of success.

313
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:34,521
We'll help the others from the outside,
okay?

314
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:42,161
Arturo, I'll be right back.
All right.

315
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:45,201
Come in.

316
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:49,041
And sit down.

317
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:57,121
- Mercedes, hi.

318
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:01,441
I've called to see what we
can do with your student.

319
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,321
He's escaped

320
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:08,041
and we found her locked in a safe.

321
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,121
What do you think this rebellion is about?

322
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:15,281
Could it be the rebelliousness
of the virgins?

323
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:17,641
- What the fuck are you talking
about virgins, man?

324
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:21,321
- Nairobi, in many species we see it.

325
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:25,401
The virgins are rebellious because
they are still unbroken.

326
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:28,401
With all due respect, it happens
just like with mares.

327
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:31,361
They are not tamed until they are mounted.

328
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:36,161
They can run away, they kick-ass,
they're completely unpredictable.

329
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:40,161
You've heard of this concept,
haven't you?

330
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:43,081
- Eh...

331
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:45,801
- At what age did you lose your virginity,
Mercedes?

332
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,001
Mercedes, it's okay.

333
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:53,241
Speak up, please, we're here.
In family, in trust.

334
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:56,081
Teacher...

335
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:04,841
- Well... Eh... I'm from a small town in Soria.

336
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:08,001
At 24.

337
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,361
- And didn't you notice that virginal
rebellion before?

338
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,761
- Well, I don't know.

339
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,641
- Think.
- Maybe so.

340
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:21,201
In fact, before I lost it,

341
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:24,721
I escaped three times to the
Medinaceli parties.

342
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:30,641
I don't know if that's what...
- That's it. Exactly.

343
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,201
- Here you go.

344
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,881
Intense coffee with a sugar cube.

345
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,281
- Thank you.

346
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,361
The festivals of Medinaceli...

347
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:51,681
What about you, Alison?
Are you a virgin?

348
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:56,081
- Yeah. So what?

349
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,241
You don't scare me with your
crazy speeches.

350
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:02,521
You're not gonna do anything to me,
you know why?

351
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:07,001
Because I'm not just a hostage,
I'm your safe conduct.

352
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:13,881
- That is, the rebellion of the
virgins here is undoubtedly.

353
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,001
Ariadna, dear, please,

354
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,361
Can you give me that red booklet?

355
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,801
- Sure.

356
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,561
Let's see what we got here.

357
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:37,961
Your aunt Becky,
a development worker in a village in Mali.

358
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,121
Here's your cousin Elsi.

359
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:43,361
Gorgeous, at King's College.

360
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:48,681
Brian, this is the brainiac of the family.
In Wellington.

361
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:53,481
And here we have several photos
of your sister Lis,

362
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:57,801
here on the side, in La Moraleja.
Study in the same school as you.

363
00:25:57,961 --> 00:26:00,721
Although I don't think he has the
same temperament as you.

364
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,681
A girl from your social station sure
doesn't have a clue

365
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:10,561
how much a hitman costs,
right?

366
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:14,121
We can find a decent one for 30 000 euros.

367
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,761
Although to unlock your aunt's shot in Africa.

368
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:20,361
with 10 000 euros we fix it.

369
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:25,721
Your family's life is in your hands.

370
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:32,601
Nairobi.
- Let's go. Let's go.

371
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:38,441
When I told you to assert yourself,
I should have told you

372
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:40,961
that the most important thing is
to choose the right moment.

373
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,801
Control call. Berlín.
Everything's fine here. In there?

374
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:00,401
Everything is in order.

375
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:04,041
Perfect. Well, next call in six hours.

376
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:10,761
- Inspector, the subsoil found oscillations.

377
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,761
in the seismograph.
They are working with heavy machinery.

378
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:15,921
Indeed, they are making a tunnel.

379
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,481
- We must bring the georadar now.

380
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:20,441
Let's see if we can find out where
they're doing the damn tunnel.

381
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:21,881
- I'll take care of it.

382
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:26,321
- Now, listen to me, all of you.

383
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:28,961
If you are not indispensable, you can go.

384
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:31,041
Essential means

385
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:33,481
who's doing something right now.

386
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:37,281
The rest of you to rest and shower,
please,

387
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:40,321
that this is already starting to smell awful.

388
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:48,001
I correct, all of you come out
for a moment, please.

389
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,241
I have to take you off the case.
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,161
I think this is going to clear up,

391
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:08,001
but right now I can't trust you, Ángel.

392
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,881
- You can't trust me.

393
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:14,761
Because it turns out that the Toledo thing

394
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:17,681
you and I, Raquel, knew.
You and me.

395
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,001
- What the fuck are you saying?

396
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:23,001
- That I am not the traitor.

397
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,881
So... it's just you.

398
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,481
- Look, you must have courage.

399
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:30,841
They knew we were going into the museum
with the masks

400
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,121
when you knew.

401
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:34,921
They knew we were going to the junkyard
when you knew.

402
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,641
And they knew about the fucking pharmacy
when you knew.

403
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,161
- Yeah? And it can't be anything else?
- What is it?

404
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:43,041
- I don't know, a call, a phone,
a fucking microphone.

405
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,121
- Only you and I knew about the pharmacy.

406
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:47,001
- And you haven't told anyone,
have you? No?

407
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:50,001
And you didn't say anything to the weird
guy in the cafeteria?

408
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,401
Huh?
How?

409
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:52,761
- Yes, to your cloth of tears.

410
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:55,641
A guy shows up here yesterday and
you tell him your whole life,

411
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,921
as if you were new.

412
00:28:57,081 --> 00:28:58,321
And you don't suspect him,
do you?

413
00:28:58,481 --> 00:28:59,961
He's been in here, Raquel.

414
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:01,681
He's been inside the tent.

415
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,001
Have you looked into it?

416
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,841
Because I do!

417
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:07,601
Did you do your damn job?

418
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:10,561
He's got this guy next door who
says he makes cider.

419
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:13,281
And he's got everything covered by tarps.
Who knows what the fuck he'll cover!

420
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:15,281
- Don't fuck with me you've been following him.

421
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:16,761
- I have been following you.

422
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:19,281
And it doesn't make cider,
it doesn't make shit!

423
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,041
He does bottle shit and throws
it in a cauldron.

424
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:24,121
And it's all full of garbage, damn it!

425
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:25,721
He's got a junk car.

426
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:28,921
And he sleeps in a bunk surrounded
by wheels and grease stains.

427
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:31,241
And it smells like a chemical,
which cooks methamphetamine.

428
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:32,481
I don't know what the hell he cooks.

429
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:35,121
It's not clean wheat, Raquel!
It's not!

430
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:37,921
And you suspect me,
I'm the only suspect.

431
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:39,801
Me? Me? Me?

432
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:46,241
- How much do they pay you?

433
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,121
A million? Two?

434
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,121
- Look, Raquel...

435
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:01,841
Listen to me carefully.

436
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,241
Go fuck yourself.

437
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,001
- Suárez!

438
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,441
Suárez!
- I can't believe it!

439
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:14,881
- Put the handcuffs on him and
get him out of here.

440
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,721
- Take it easy, inspector.
That's not the procedure.

441
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:20,041
- Yes, it is.
Suárez, put the handcuffs on me, dammit.

442
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:22,201
- I'm in the middle of the fucking procedure.

443
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,481
Put the handcuffs on him and get him out of here!

444
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,721
- If you want, I can call Internal Affairs

445
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:29,041
but here, for now, no one's gonna
handcuff anyone.

446
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,761
- Raquel...

447
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:34,601
I've been with you for 15 years.

448
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,041
- With me? No.

449
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:39,681
You've been snuggling up to me for
15 years to see if I fall.

450
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:42,081
Always with the fucking Cercedilla
in your mouth.

451
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:43,881
With the "I will leave Mari Carmen".

452
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,041
And with your fucking bingo flirt jokes.

453
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:47,641
And now that I finally say no,

454
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:49,481
it turns out that this horny don Pimpón

455
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,121
has become a traitor, a traitor!

456
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:56,321
You've sold out, Ángel.

457
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:57,841
Our friendship...

458
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,241
this operation...

459
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:02,921
Look...

460
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:04,721
Get the hell out of here right now.

461
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:17,961
"Do you know what collateral damage means?

462
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:21,201
It's a term coined during the Vietnam War

463
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:22,561
by the American army.

464
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,641
When they didn't have balls

465
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,361
to talk directly about the murder of civilians.

466
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,001
But sometimes it's also used to get rid of guilt,

467
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,481
like a boomerang.

468
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:39,041
And that was what was about to happen
to the Profesor."

469
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,161
Let's go!

470
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:52,761
Hurry up!

471
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,161
Hurry up, let's go!

472
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:58,161
Come on, hurry up!

473
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:07,201
Take a couple of bags and pick this shit up.

474
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:10,241
Then comes the dinner.

475
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:13,401
- I managed to steal some things
from the toolbox.

476
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:14,641
What things?

477
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,201
Well...

478
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:20,881
Saw blades, screwdrivers, files...

479
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,441
All right, all right. Chist!

480
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:24,321
What are you doing, what are you doing?
Hide it.

481
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:30,961
In 35 minutes,

482
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,081
ask to be taken back to the bathroom.

483
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:35,521
You enter the second toilet on the left,

484
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,841
you take the tools and stick them under
the toilet seat,

485
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,001
inside.

486
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:44,881
They'll be here in, like,
40 minutes, okay?

487
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,641
It cannot be. I mean, me?
Me again?

488
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,721
I've already stolen all the tools,

489
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:55,521
I'm loaded with junk, for fuck's sake.

490
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,001
And what do you want,
to give them to me here?

491
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:03,561
You do your part, I'll do mine, kid.

492
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,761
"Raquel...

493
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:10,121
Is something wrong?
Are you all right?"

494
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,281
Eh...

495
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:15,761
Well, I'm here alone and bored in the
cafeteria and...

496
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:19,401
And a little disappointed,
if you want me to tell you the truth.

497
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:22,921
Excuse me, I don't understand.
Disappointed?

498
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:26,401
I was just meeting someone for dinner.

499
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:29,401
My first dinner in eight years with...

500
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:32,681
With someone who wasn't in my family, I mean.

501
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:35,801
But I think he stood me up.

502
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:40,841
And isn't it that you're about
36 minutes early?

503
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:42,801
It's possible.

504
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:45,041
The truth is, I'm a very impatient woman.

505
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:47,921
Excuse me, Salva.

506
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:50,921
Forgive the joke, no...

507
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:53,841
I just wanted to make sure you
remembered about the dinner.

508
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:58,081
The truth is, I'm afraid of the sit-ins.

509
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:02,801
I wouldn't know what to do, how to get out of here,
if you didn't show up.

510
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:05,321
I don't know, I guess I'd stay here with...

511
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:09,121
With my heels and alone and...

512
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,321
And drinking pints until they came to evict me.

513
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:16,201
Inaccessible to discouragement.
No. Dead of shame.

514
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:18,961
Don't worry about it.

515
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:21,121
I'll be right with you.

516
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:22,361
In five minutes.

517
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,561
So far.

518
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:25,561
Until now.

519
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,161
When you're near me,
it's hard for me to breathe.

520
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:49,921
Then breathe.

521
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,681
Because nine months from now,
you're going to have your breath cut off.

522
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,761
It's a joke, right?

523
00:34:56,921 --> 00:34:58,601
Please tell me it's a joke.

524
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:00,401
No, it's not a joke.
It's not a joke.

525
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:01,801
No.

526
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:05,601
Mónica, I'm technically sterile.

527
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:10,241
You must be Shiva, the goddess of fertility.

528
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,521
Do I call my wife, tell her to pick up the kids

529
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,601
and we all go out together
to celebrate?

530
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:18,121
Do we do as any marriage
that has three children?

531
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:19,361
Not that I was going to separate.

532
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:28,841
I brought you an awesome menu.

533
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:31,561
A sandwich that... that...

534
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,281
Well, I ate it a couple of times
and I didn't die,

535
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:35,641
so more or less...

536
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:37,961
Biscuits that...

537
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:40,601
I took them gluten-free.

538
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:43,001
Because I thought: "Maybe...

539
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:45,961
can be celiac, right?
Like a lot of people.

540
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:47,681
Yeah.
I say, "Well, you better be."

541
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:50,481
And a chocolate bun because I like it a lot.

542
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,601
Ah, well, and...

543
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:53,881
And some sweets.

544
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:56,081
Do you want some?

545
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:38,361
Hi, I'm Raquel.
I can't attend you right now.

546
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,801
If urgent, leave a message after the beep.

547
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:45,961
- Raquel.
Raquel, this is Ángel.

548
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:49,001
Listen, I'm asking you to reconsider.

549
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:53,961
Look, I understand the bad moment.
I too have gone too far.

550
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:57,321
Hell, it's not the first fight
you and I ever had, is it?

551
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:05,801
Look, I'll be an asshole or
whatever you want, but...

552
00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:08,801
But I'm not the mole.

553
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:11,681
I'm not the mole, damn it.

554
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,561
You're gonna fuck up my life, Raquel.

555
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,041
You're gonna fuck up my life, damn it.

556
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:24,441
Give me a call.

557
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,641
It's a good thing I introduced myself,

558
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:44,601
since the date you have didn't appear.

559
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:49,481
Oh, yes, I don't know what would have happened
to me if you hadn't shown up.

560
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:50,601
Sure.

561
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:54,961
And is this date was of particular
interest to you or...?

562
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:58,241
No, not anymore.

563
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:00,601
What a pity.

564
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:02,601
What a pity.

565
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,881
Well, let see if I'm at least good for something.

566
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:09,441
I'm sure you do.

567
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:14,921
Well, I'm glad. What happens is that
I have to confess to you that...

568
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:20,001
that we are both in danger because...

569
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,041
If I take another one of this,
I'll start humming songs.

570
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,161
So, we're going to find ourselves
in trouble..

571
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:30,601
I'm sure you'll be very funny.

572
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:37,201
How long will we keep calling each other formaly?

573
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,881
When you look at me under the table.

574
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:52,281
Eh...

575
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,241
Come on, Salva.

576
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:00,961
Take a look.

577
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:04,241
Look at me under the table.

578
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:11,641
I warn you, if you're going to
make me a "basic instinct,"

579
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,961
I still need something stronger because
I'm a little classic.

580
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,121
Salva, do as I say.

581
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:43,441
I don't want you to make anything strange in here.

582
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:48,921
I have well-founded suspicions that
you're hiding something in that workshop

583
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:50,601
where it supposedly makes cider.

584
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:56,441
So, two options, or you take me there
for good

585
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,001
or we wait here to get a court order,

586
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:03,481
but I'm warning you,
it's gonna take a couple of hours.

587
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:05,481
So...

588
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:08,481
it's up to you.

589
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:30,161
Hey, what do you think the morning
before a robbery?

590
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,241
I mean, you get up and what goes
through your head?

591
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:36,041
Well, I don't know.

592
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:39,641
You get up at dawn...

593
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:43,001
You smoke.

594
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,961
You talk bullshit.

595
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:49,161
What are you doing smoking so early, son?

596
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:50,921
- He said the frying pan to the saucepan.

597
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:57,561
How are you?
- Good, and you?

598
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,441
Well, nothing from other world.

599
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,801
Yes, it does take a lot of courage.

600
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:06,841
I'm telling you because I think about
those things, you know?

601
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:10,361
In the people who are on death row.

602
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:13,561
or guys like you, who shoot their way into a mousetrap.

603
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:15,361
It's no big deal.
Yes, it is.

604
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:17,721
I'm telling you, I'm a coward.

605
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:24,361
Look at me, with a married guy to
avoid the fear of failure

606
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:27,481
or to be abandoned.
You are no coward.

607
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:30,281
Yes, I am.
You are not. You're not.

608
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,561
You stole a cell phone in the middle
of the robbery,

609
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:36,081
you insisted that I shoot you in the leg

610
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:38,401
and you stood up to the Berlín moron.

611
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:42,081
And you had the balls to grab
my neck and kiss me,

612
00:42:42,241 --> 00:42:43,841
and fuck me.

613
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:46,921
You must have a big balls to fuck a crazy man

614
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:50,361
with Dalí's mask.
You are Nikita in secretary.

615
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,081
Actually,

616
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:01,281
on the morning of the heist
I was really scared.

617
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:03,361
Scared as fuck.

618
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:05,881
- What?
- All this, Dad.

619
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:11,641
This guy, who seems very clever,

620
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:14,881
but I don't know, it is crazy.

621
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:17,761
- At least he knows what he's saying.

622
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:23,281
- I began to doubt everything.

623
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:26,521
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here.
- Well, be with me.

624
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:29,041
- Here everybody is an expert

625
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:32,561
the girl who prints bills, you who...

626
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:35,281
You're a master at your thing, Dad,
but I...

627
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:37,401
I haven't done anything good in my life.

628
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:39,361
I was a hell of a guy.

629
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:41,761
He told me he needed me and here I am,

630
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:46,001
meeting the prettiest girl in
all this madness.

631
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:05,481
One minute.

632
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:26,801
These are the tools we've managed to steal.

633
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:29,481
Undress and stick them to your body
with insulating tape.

634
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:31,561
so you can take it to the basement
and let loose.

635
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:33,681
Cut the tubes from the boiler room

636
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:36,161
and anything you can arm yourselves with.

637
00:44:36,321 --> 00:44:37,601
At 21:00 you have dinner,

638
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:40,801
you will seize that moment to
disarm your captors

639
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:43,201
and run away.
We'll meet at the warehouse

640
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:44,721
hidden behind the coils.

641
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:46,961
I'll try to take as many
hostages as possible

642
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:48,401
without jeopardizing the plan."

643
00:44:50,361 --> 00:44:51,601
- One second.

644
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:55,681
- Get out.

645
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:02,361
Hey, what did you do before in life?
You haven't always been a robber.

646
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:05,401
Not at all. I've worked on a lot of things.
On what?

647
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,681
Mainly commercial.

648
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,561
And, well, also in the chemical industry,

649
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,401
of security in a park.

650
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:16,641
Well, I also dance in a disco.

651
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:17,761
What?
Yes, yes.

652
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,121
Shirtless, with a bunch of chicks
in a cage giving it all.

653
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:23,881
But like "chunda, chunda"?
And whatever they put.

654
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:26,601
Samba, twist, rock and roll.

655
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:27,881
What do you say?
Yes, I do.

656
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,041
What do you flip? That you flip.

657
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:31,121
Let me dance, show me how you dance.

658
00:45:31,281 --> 00:45:34,641
Here? Come on, dance with me a bit.

659
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:39,281
Give me a minute.

660
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:35,521
"Hi, I'm Raquel.
I can't take care of you right now.

661
00:46:35,681 --> 00:46:38,361
If it's urgent,
leave a message after the beep."

662
00:46:39,561 --> 00:46:41,601
Raquel, may I ask why the hell

663
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:43,401
won't you pick up my phone?

664
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:48,201
Huh? After 15 years with you by your
side like a fucking loser.

665
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:54,961
And not for getting close to you,
no, no, for friendship, for love.

666
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:57,041
Do you hear me? For love.

667
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:11,801
Come in, please.
No, you come in.

668
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:14,521
Come on, let's go.

669
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:23,921
What's this?

670
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:26,641
It's a warehouse.

671
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:30,041
What about these plastics?

672
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:32,281
They're just plastics to
protect from the cold,

673
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:34,681
don't be scared.
I'm not scared.

674
00:47:38,401 --> 00:47:39,681
Go on.

675
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:55,281
Turn on the light

676
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:00,281
and don't do anything stupid.

677
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:34,521
Listen, I almost sent everything to hell,

678
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,121
to send Mari Carmen to hell.

679
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,401
for a bitch who wouldn't fuck anyone.

680
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:42,561
Do you hear me? You are a bitch,
a selfish and obsessive bitch.

681
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:46,281
You're a fucking bitch!
Fucking bitch! A pussy-eater!

682
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:49,081
A fucking frigid! A fucking frigid!

683
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:38,321
Raquel, it's me, Ángel, again.

684
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:43,361
Forgive me, I didn't mean to
call you a bitch.

685
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:44,481
Really, I'm sorry.

686
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:50,081
You'll sink me.

687
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,241
I don't know what I'm gonna do
if I'm kicked out of the Police.

688
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:56,041
Hell, I don't know how I'm gonna be.

689
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,721
You will destroy me.

690
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:08,561
I know I told you I was unemployed,

691
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:12,161
but this cider thing is not a job as such,

692
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:14,161
is merely a project.

693
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:16,401
I don't know if it's going to be
right or wrong.

694
00:50:16,561 --> 00:50:19,401
And, honestly, I don't know
what's going on.

695
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:23,961
I don't know if your partner
saw anything illegal.

696
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,161
Well it's true

697
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:27,481
that there are some nights I sleep here,

698
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:30,601
in the bunk beds, and I don't have a
certificate of habitability yet.

699
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,881
and I don't know if that's what he saw.

700
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:34,241
or that I need to pass
some kind of inspection.

701
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:35,761
I don't know, I don't...

702
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:38,721
Cider.

703
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:41,401
Can I try the cider?

704
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:46,561
Sure, sure.

705
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:50,201
"It was foreseeable that the inspector
would want to enter

706
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:52,561
in the Profesor's little secret corner.

707
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,441
And for a handful of euros

708
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:57,481
it's easy to rent a crappy warehouse

709
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,641
and turn it into the perfect set

710
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:01,041
for the function.

711
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:03,681
Whether you want to believe or not...

712
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:06,401
was the part the inspector
was supposed to play."

713
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:12,121
I'm sorry, Salva.

714
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:16,921
This place is wonderful.

715
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,201
I feel very embarrassed...

716
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:25,321
for showing him the gun

717
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:29,641
to force him to bring me here, the truth.

718
00:51:29,801 --> 00:51:32,561
I would have preferred to show you
something else.

719
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:35,921
I want to say something else like you say,

720
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:37,561
the "basic instinct" thing.

721
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:42,761
I'd feel a lot less ridiculous

722
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:45,961
and ashamed of what I am now.

723
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:53,401
And to think I almost sent my ex-husband.

724
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:59,801
Your ex-husband?
Yes, I know he's a fucking bastard,

725
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:04,641
but he's the best in the entire CSI,

726
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:07,121
because since I'd been described as if it were

727
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:09,081
a drug lab...

728
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:12,841
Drugs.
Yes.

729
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:18,201
Come on, I almost screwed up even more.

730
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:50,641
I want you to know I'm never
pulling out the gun again.

731
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:53,121
Yeah.
Yeah.

732
00:52:57,001 --> 00:53:00,721
Neither to frisk you nor
to doubt you any more.

733
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:05,721
About you.
Of you, of you, of you.

734
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:09,961
It's about time we stopped
dealing with formalities,

735
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:11,441
don't you think?

736
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:14,081
I think it's time we use
first-named, yes.

737
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,481
Yes, yes.

738
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,961
Ángel, do I get you all right?
- Yes, tell me, Pilar.

739
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:37,161
- I have the results of what you asked for.

740
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:38,921
I ran the print from the car

741
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:42,321
and also the one with the spoon that brought me
and, bingo, they match.

742
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:44,161
The person who touched that spoon

743
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,241
is the same one that forced the patrol car.

744
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:50,601
- It's awesome, Pilar, it's awesome.
I'll call you back.

745
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:02,761
"The voice mailbox of the number
you are calling is full."

746
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:04,001
Fucking hell.

747
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:10,281
It is time. The guards must be
letting go by now.

748
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:12,281
At 22:30 you will arrive at the warehouse.

749
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:14,041
Do you know where it is?
Yes.

750
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:17,681
Can I warn someone, 5 or 6?
No way.

751
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,561
Are you crazy?
Why?

752
00:54:19,721 --> 00:54:21,641
You want to fuck this up before we start?

753
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:24,081
Three people suppose a serious
risk to the plan,

754
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:25,401
four would be crazy.

755
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,521
We'll help you from the outside.
Who's that third person?

756
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:30,881
Mónica Gaztambide.
Ah!

757
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:33,161
She's pregnant and we need to
get her out of here.

758
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:35,321
Yeah, yeah.
Where the fuck are you going?

759
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,241
To find her.
What about me?

760
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:39,041
Do I stay here?
How do I get to the warehouse?

761
00:54:39,201 --> 00:54:40,881
I can't go in and out the way I want.

762
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:45,241
Don't fuck with me.
Much worse is what I have to do.

763
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:48,481
I have to convince that guy
to take me to Mónica.

764
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:52,401
and then get rid of him.
You gonna kill him?

765
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:55,601
What I'm not gonna do is stand here
like a lamb

766
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:56,841
to get shot.

767
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,321
A man has to do what he has to do.

768
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:04,921
Helsinki.

769
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:07,081
What's going on?

770
00:55:07,761 --> 00:55:09,761
I'm still not feeling well, huh?

771
00:55:11,081 --> 00:55:13,801
What's up, Arturo,
you want more pills?

772
00:55:13,961 --> 00:55:15,161
No, I don't.

773
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:18,001
I wish mine could be solved with an aspirin.

774
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:22,401
It's not that, it's that before,

775
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:24,921
when I saw Mónica Gaztambide

776
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:27,161
and I saw that she was alive,
that she was fine,

777
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:30,801
I've collapsed.

778
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,201
and I don't think I reacted as she expected.

779
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:39,081
The thing is, then that fellow of yours,
Denver,

780
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:41,481
He's taken her down or wherever you have her

781
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:43,121
to rest.

782
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:47,321
and I felt a need to talk to her.

783
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:49,841
I've felt it very strong.

784
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:56,241
Please, man help man in love.

785
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:57,681
Yes?

786
00:55:57,841 --> 00:55:59,241
It's all right.

787
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:04,601
Okay, Arturito, okay.

788
00:56:05,201 --> 00:56:06,801
Come on, let's go.
Thank you.

789
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:24,081
"And as our first defeat approached,

790
00:56:24,241 --> 00:56:26,921
the brain of the operation was absent,

791
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:30,361
because as brilliant as it was,

792
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,041
He only had two eyes.

793
00:56:32,961 --> 00:56:35,361
and at that time they were
for the inspector."

794
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:37,041
What?

795
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:39,401
Nothing.

796
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,761
What?

797
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:45,121
You were looking at me.

798
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:48,801
I just don't know,

799
00:56:48,961 --> 00:56:54,081
without the glasses you look
like someone else.

800
00:56:55,441 --> 00:56:59,321
Like Superman and Clark Kent.

801
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,481
I like you more with glasses?

802
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:10,561
No. I didn't say that.

803
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:13,081
I'll put them on right now.

804
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:21,321
It's a little weird to sleep with glasses,
nothing happens.

805
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,161
I usually take them off, but today...

806
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:25,241
today is a special day.

807
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:28,281
Better?

808
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:42,361
The thing is, I can't sleep over,

809
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:44,001
I'm sorry.

810
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:57,481
I don't know, I want to wake up
with my daughter,

811
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,201
take her to school,

812
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:02,601
who sees that he still has a mother.
Sure.

813
00:58:09,561 --> 00:58:12,921
"Hi, I'm Raquel.
I can't take care of you now.

814
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:15,361
If it's urgent,
leave a message after the beep."

815
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:21,041
Raquel, it's me again. Call me.
Your answering machine is full.

816
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:23,441
We got him, listen, we got him.

817
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:26,001
We've got the guy who's helping
them from the outside.

818
00:58:26,161 --> 00:58:28,561
But to take your daughter to school,
they must still be

819
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:31,721
at least 7-8 hours.

820
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:37,601
I mean, maybe being there at 00:00 or 01:00

821
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:42,041
or 7:00 would be enough.

822
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,281
And it's Salva, Salva,

823
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:51,001
Salva, the one with the cider,

824
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:54,481
he was in the junkyard, he threatened the Russian,
for fuck's sake.

825
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:55,801
- I'm sorry.

826
00:58:56,841 --> 00:58:57,921
I'm not staying.

827
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:04,641
Hey, what about that piano over there?

828
00:59:04,801 --> 00:59:06,641
Do you play the piano?

829
00:59:06,801 --> 00:59:09,761
He's using you, damn it,
his fingerprints were on the zeta.

830
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,601
He's come to you to take advantage of the investigation.

831
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,041
He's using you.

832
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:15,521
Shit.

833
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:16,841
Oh, shit.

834
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:52,921
Is that your wife?

835
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:57,721
No.
Mónica's not a scandal maker.

836
01:00:57,881 --> 01:00:59,841
Must be one of your companions.

837
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:16,121
Don't stop it.

838
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:19,041
Fucking hell.

839
01:01:19,121 --> 01:01:20,601
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

840
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,121
"Arturo had finally made a heroic gesture.

841
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:40,361
And instead of running away alone,

842
01:02:40,521 --> 01:02:43,081
had decided to rescue his princess,

843
01:02:44,121 --> 01:02:46,641
but it went off the rails,

844
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:48,881
because princesses have their lives too."

845
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,281
What is it, Mónica?

846
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:51,601
"And its secrets."

847
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:53,441
Was this savage raping you?

848
01:02:53,601 --> 01:02:55,881
No, he didn't rape me,
don't talk nonsense, Arturo.

849
01:02:58,081 --> 01:03:00,721
"We've always heard stories of
husbands discovering

850
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:02,241
their wives with the lover,

851
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:06,961
but when Arturo found his lover's lover,

852
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:08,881
he forgot the escape plan."

853
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:10,601
Arturo, man.

854
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:14,321
"And he could only hear one word."

855
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:15,961
I'm fine.
Breathe.

856
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:17,481
I'm fine.
Give a deep back.

857
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:18,601
"Revenge."

858
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,881
Get dressed, honey,
get out of here, please.

859
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,801
What?
Get dressed and get out of here,

860
01:03:22,961 --> 01:03:24,281
please.
No, I'm not leaving.

861
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:27,281
Take it out, leave me alone
with this one.

862
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:30,281
What do you want to do?
Let's not mess it up, Arturito,

863
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:32,361
We need to talk about this.

864
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:33,521
No, I don't want to leave.

865
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:35,441
I said get her the fuck out of here.

866
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:37,801
You take her out and leave me alone
with this shit.

867
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:41,601
Yes, you and me.
Yes, here, now, you and me.

868
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:43,401
Huh? Son of a bitch.

869
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,001
Please.
Get out.

870
01:03:57,161 --> 01:03:58,161
No.
Get out, it's okay.

871
01:03:58,321 --> 01:03:59,641
It's all right, it's all right.
No.

872
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:03,721
It's all right.
I don't want to leave.

873
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,081
Get out. Get out.
I want to stay here.

874
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:08,001
Get out, it's okay.

875
01:04:14,961 --> 01:04:15,921
- Let's go.

876
01:04:27,081 --> 01:04:29,121
You've got big balls to take advantage of

877
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:31,201
of a defenceless and wounded woman.

878
01:04:32,921 --> 01:04:35,361
Let's see if you have the same
balls to face me,

879
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:36,601
you son of a bitch.

880
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:46,441
You'll hurt yourself, Arturito,
be careful.

881
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:02,281
Stop!
- No, I am a hostage,

882
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,001
I'm meeting Arturo Román.

883
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:05,801
- Where is Don Arturo?
- I don't know.

884
01:05:05,961 --> 01:05:08,481
He told me to be here at 22:30.

885
01:05:09,921 --> 01:05:13,041
Let's go now, please.
- Let wait for Don Arturo.

886
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:16,081
Two minutes to go.

887
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:18,121
She's pregnant, you know that?

888
01:05:19,401 --> 01:05:20,561
She's pregnant with my child.

889
01:05:20,721 --> 01:05:21,801
From me!

890
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:23,921
And I don't think my son's
gonna fucking like it

891
01:05:24,081 --> 01:05:26,361
for you to come knock on her door,
faggot.

892
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:31,481
Arturito, you're winning a smack with a prize,
stop it now.

893
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:33,081
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker.

894
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:37,681
Fucking hell.

895
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:44,921
Who's laughing now, huh?

896
01:05:45,081 --> 01:05:46,281
Huh?

897
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:49,601
I don't hear that stupid polygon fool laugh.

898
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:50,921
Huh?

899
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:06,201
Did you try to kill me with round scissors,

900
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:07,481
Arturito?

901
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:11,161
I'm sorry.

902
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:14,681
I didn't mean it, I swear.

903
01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:17,361
It's this demon stress that makes me wrong.

904
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:20,401
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
You're stupid.

905
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:23,481
Don't hit me.
Give me a fucking reason...

906
01:06:23,641 --> 01:06:24,801
Look at me.

907
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:28,041
Give me one fucking reason
not to open your head now.

908
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:29,561
Give me one fucking reason.

909
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:31,561
They're escaping, they're escaping.

910
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:32,881
What?
They're getting away.

911
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,761
16 hostages, 16 hostages, right now,

912
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:36,761
and I know where.

913
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:46,641
Time's up, gentlemen. Let's go.

914
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:01,721
Halt! Halt!

915
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:09,201
Plastic explosive.

916
01:07:16,521 --> 01:07:18,521
- They're escaping, 16 hostages,

917
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:19,921
through the loading area.

918
01:07:20,561 --> 01:07:22,881
- Tokio, go find Nairobi.

919
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:25,641
Río, Denver, bring Oslo and Helsinki.

920
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:48,921
- What's going on?
What's going on?

921
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:50,881
- 16 hostages are trying to escape.

922
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:52,321
- Fucking hell.

923
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,601
- And we're gonna go get 'em.

924
01:07:56,761 --> 01:07:58,041
- Ah.

925
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:00,321
- Are we?
We are.

926
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:01,441
We are.

927
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:04,881
- Let's go, let's go.

928
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,121
Take cover, take cover.

929
01:08:08,361 --> 01:08:10,401
Is everyone covered?
- Yes.

930
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:12,481
- Let's see.

931
01:09:36,281 --> 01:09:38,241
Where the fuck have you been?

932
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:46,441
No one's getting out of here.

933
01:09:46,601 --> 01:09:49,401
We've got the bloody guy helping
them from the outside.

934
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,521
It's the cider guy.

935
01:09:54,761 --> 01:09:55,841
Raquel!
- Raquel!

936
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:57,121
- Raquel!

937
01:09:57,281 --> 01:10:00,801
The time has come to make a decision.

938
01:10:02,881 --> 01:10:05,281
Assault team prevented, we're going in.

939
01:10:08,081 --> 01:10:09,121
Fuck!

940
01:10:10,481 --> 01:10:11,441
Get down!

941
01:10:19,441 --> 01:10:20,561
On your knees.

942
01:10:35,641 --> 01:10:37,281
Helsinki!

943
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:46,441
Now.

944
01:10:46,601 --> 01:10:49,201
Three, two, one, fire!
