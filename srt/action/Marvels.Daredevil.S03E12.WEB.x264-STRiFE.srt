1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Sir.

2
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,060
- What?
- Nadeem escaped.

3
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,310
He's in the wind.

4
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,980
Then find him!

5
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello, Wilson.

6
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,020
Okay. There's nobody watching.

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,490
Straight up there, please.

8
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,620
Nice and easy. No rush.

9
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,460
Go.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,590
Thanks, Mrs. Mahoney.

11
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,220
Y'all ain't the only ones
haunted by Wilson Fisk.

12
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,220
Thank you, dear.

13
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,520
Uh, fresh sheets on the bed.
Towels if you need.

14
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,320
Uh... Thank you. Really.

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,740
And don't worry. Nobody knows you're here.

16
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,540
Seema, if you...

17
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,290
You promised
you would never lie to me again.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,960
Seems, if you understood
what was going on here...

19
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,260
Do you know why I married you, Ray?

20
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,180
It wasn't your good looks
or my father's blessing.

21
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,230
It was because I believed in my soul that
I had found a good man who would love me.

22
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,270
And who would be
completely honest with me.

23
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,650
Seems, I do love you...

24
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,730
You lied again and again.

25
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,200
And now here we are, running.

26
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,740
Hiding in some lady's house.

27
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,120
Fisk played me. Okay?
And before I knew it...

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
You brought a gunfight to our home!

29
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,540
You're right.

30
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,750
About everything.

31
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,130
But I will fix it.

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,680
Sami was curled up with me in a bathtub,
waiting for men to come kill him.

33
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,610
Do you know what I hoped for
in that moment?

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,230
That they'd kill him first,
so he didn't have to watch me die.

35
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,270
How do you fix that?

36
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,780
Seems, Seems...

37
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,360
I am so sorry.

38
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,030
But I will make you and Sami safe.

39
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,160
I promise you.

40
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,540
I can't let what you say
matter to me anymore, Rahul.

41
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,800
Sami deserves at least one person
in his life he can trust.

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,010
And that's never going to be you.

43
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,900
Mahoney really stepped up for us.
Mrs. M, too.

44
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,820
Everyone in the neighborhood
wants Fisk gone.

45
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,910
Foggy, you don't need
to talk me into this anymore.

46
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,080
I promised we'd do it your way,
and we are.

47
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,910
Good. 'Cause it's gonna work.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,580
Good. I hope you're right.

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,670
Are we clear?

50
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,890
So, what now?

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,720
You're going to testify against Fisk,
once you hire us to represent you.

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,690
Represent me?

53
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,560
As Nelson and Murdock, attorneys at law.

54
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,870
Three restaurants,
the best spa in the city...

55
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,790
a full staff waiting
to fulfill our every need,

56
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,000
It's all ours.

57
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
"Ours"?

58
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,750
You bought it?

59
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
For you.

60
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,680
There's a penthouse
with the best view of the city.

61
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,260
Our city.

62
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,100
It's everything you've ever wanted.

63
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
- Sir, uh...
- Not now.

64
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,290
- It's important.
- Not now.

65
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,210
Good night.

66
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,740
Can I get you something?

67
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,070
Champagne?

68
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,370
Not now, thank you.

69
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,130
I don't have your eye...

70
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,260
but I hung them
where I guessed you would like them.

71
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,480
We can move them or...
buy other ones, whatever you like.

72
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,360
I thought that you might
want to curate a collection

73
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,910
and display it throughout the hotel.

74
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,300
Thank you.

75
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,720
This is all so generous.

76
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,050
It's nothing.
I wanted you to feel welcome.

77
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,140
I do.

78
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,060
It's...

79
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,850
incredible.

80
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,980
Do you want something to eat
from one of the restaurants,

81
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,900
or I could make you something?

82
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,490
I'm not hungry... just tired.

83
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,070
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,990
You've gone through so much trouble.

85
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,410
No, no. Please. I...

86
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,080
You had a long trip. I should have...

87
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,500
I should have realized
that this could be overwhelming.

88
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,960
It's sweet...

89
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,050
but all I want right now
is a hot bath and a soft bed.

90
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,510
The master suite is upstairs.
I'll show you.

91
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,640
No need.

92
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,850
I'll find it.

93
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,840
This is your law office?

94
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,630
Nobody knows about this place.
We'll be safe here. Take a seat.

95
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,890
Ms. Page.

96
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,350
Agent Nadeem.

97
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,310
You tried to warn me about Fisk.

98
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,110
I should have listened.

99
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,400
- And about what happened at the church...
- Let's not... Let's not go there.

100
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,810
In the end, you got me out alive,

101
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,160
so I guess that means
we're on the same side now.

102
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,250
Yeah. I guess it does.

103
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,540
All right. We're gonna get your family
safe, Ray, but we can't ask for WITSEC.

104
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,460
If Fisk got to the Bureau,
he can get to the Marshals Service.

105
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,550
We were thinking overseas.
Maybe with a friend or a distant relative.

106
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,090
Uh...

107
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,930
my brother's wife has a cousin in Bihar.

108
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,010
- I never liked him.
- Oh, I can get 'em a flight.

109
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,980
But Fisk's people
will be watching the airports,

110
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,500
so we should fly 'em out of Montreal.

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,400
Um, I've had some time to think
about how to get away from him.

112
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,460
They'll be watching
my bank accounts.

113
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,490
We'll cover it.

114
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Thanks.

115
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,700
But it might be more than I deserve.

116
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,420
Look, you... you hurt people.

117
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,590
It doesn't have to define you.

118
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,930
You should get ready, Ray.

119
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,890
Locker room is through there.

120
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,470
Yeah.

121
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,950
You're right.
His mistakes don't need to define him.

122
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,030
Neither do yours.

123
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,450
I should get going.
I don't wanna miss my window.

124
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,040
Really?
No, uh, "It's too dangerous, Karen"?

125
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,130
Clearly, you can handle yourself.

126
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,850
But, you know,
Karen, please, be careful.

127
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Got it.

128
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,670
Detective Mahoney.

129
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,550
I see you're putting in
for early retirement.

130
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,390
No, sir, Mr. District Attorney.
There's someone who needs to talk to you.

131
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,970
Oh, hell.

132
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,270
You ever hear of a phone?

133
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,860
I'm as familiar with my phone
as you are with the "ignore call" button.

134
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,030
What do you want?

135
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,860
Another viral video you can use
to campaign against me?

136
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,780
I want to make you an offer
that you won't want to refuse.

137
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,790
I can't wait.

138
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,950
In exchange for an hour of your time,

139
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,500
I'll drop out of the race
and hand you the election.

140
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,330
- What's the punch line?
- No punch line.

141
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,170
I'm just asking that you sit down with
Matt Murdock and me and a client of ours,

142
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,840
and just listen to what he has to say.

143
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,010
I do that, and you just drop out?

144
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Uh-huh.

145
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,050
You know,
I don't even pick up a book in the airport

146
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,730
without reading the last page first?

147
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,310
I need to know what this meeting is about.

148
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,280
- It's about Wilson Fisk.
- For the love of...

149
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,110
You need help, Nelson.
Get the hell out of my car.

150
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,660
Fisk is threatening my family.

151
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,450
He got them dirty, and now he's using them
as leverage against me.

152
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,830
So if you win the election...

153
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,630
and take my job,
Fisk will control New York's DA?

154
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,510
Right.

155
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,800
So, honestly, I'm dropping out whether
you give me an hour of your time or not.

156
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,640
But I'm asking you to anyway.

157
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,940
You'll withdraw publicly?

158
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,900
And endorse you.

159
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Throw in an extra 15 minutes,
I'll even vote for you.

160
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,110
You ready for this?

161
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,240
Testifying is not gonna be easy.

162
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,660
I loved my job.

163
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,120
And I loved being the good guy.

164
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,460
I want to be
on the right side of the line again.

165
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,670
You didn't love it enough to stop Fisk.

166
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,560
Fisk knows how to make people vulnerable.

167
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,230
He got my sister-in-law's
health insurance canceled,

168
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,560
left my family with bills to pay.
Bills that I had to...

169
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,150
So you take a loan, you sell your house,
you figure it out.

170
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,110
You don't allow yourself
to become an accessory.

171
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,070
- It wasn't that easy...
- You backed his play, Ray.

172
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,360
You moved him into his hotel,
even gave him his toys back.

173
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,130
He was giving information
that saved lives.

174
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,530
While he was taking lives.
While he was taking over the city!

175
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,901
What the hell are you doing?
I thought you were my lawyer!

176
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,270
I am your lawyer, but I can't help you if
you can't answer this one simple question.

177
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,630
Why didn't you blow the whistle when you
watched your boss murder an agent?

178
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,500
I don't know.

179
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,340
Or when you saw Dex walk in that church?

180
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,430
You didn't say a goddamn word
when he murdered a priest.

181
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,070
- I don't know.
- Then why are we here?!

182
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,010
Because I took the damn bait!

183
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,270
Because I didn't want my son to see me
as just an average federal employee.

184
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,610
I messed up.

185
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,490
I destroyed my life.

186
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,830
My family's life.

187
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,170
And I would do anything
to take it all back again.

188
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Good.

189
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,220
You tell that to the DA,
and I can help you.

190
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,610
Blake Tower, FBI Special Agent Ray Nadeem.

191
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,900
We've met.

192
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,150
Before we begin, some ground rules.

193
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,070
Our client will speak to you
under terms of use immunity.

194
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,030
He does not waive
his Fifth Amendment rights.

195
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,780
Special Agent, I should advise you
that Misters Nelson and Murdock

196
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,310
have their own agendas in this case.

197
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,210
Conflicts of interest are not something
you want in legal counsel.

198
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,630
I trust them.

199
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,550
Suit yourself.

200
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,800
Mr. Nelson played his biggest
and last card to get me here.

201
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,050
So, what are you going to tell me?

202
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,810
He's going to tell you that Wilson Fisk
has had people murdered,

203
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,930
blackmailed
federal law enforcement personnel,

204
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,740
and is currently taxing
New York's criminals

205
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,770
in exchange for protection
from prosecution.

206
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,900
And your client
has personally witnessed these acts?

207
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,440
He did. And he's prepared to testify.

208
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,030
Now, before I agree to that,

209
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,990
Agent Nadeem,
why are you coming forward now?

210
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,910
I hurt people.

211
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,210
My pride hurt people.

212
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,130
And I need to make that right again.

213
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,010
Okay.

214
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,390
I accept the terms of use immunity.

215
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,970
Tell me what you know.

216
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,580
Can I get you anything else, sir?

217
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,800
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about Karen Page.

218
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,050
She would be dead
if Agent Nadeem hadn't interfered.

219
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,430
After everything you've done for me, I...

220
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,570
I just wanted to tell you
that I'll keep my word.

221
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,070
I will find her, and when I do,
I am going...

222
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,360
No.

223
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,240
This matter will be handled,
but not by you.

224
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,410
- I can handle Agent Nadeem.
- Do nothing.

225
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,250
It's clear that I have put
too great a burden on your shoulders.

226
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,720
After the attack on my home...

227
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,890
I secured my family
and came directly here.

228
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,270
- This is unbelievable.
- Believe it.

229
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,980
I can convene a special grand jury today.
Probably by 4:00 p.m.

230
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,820
Great. Our offer is straightforward.

231
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,570
Agent Nadeem's testimony
in exchange for full immunity.

232
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,660
He just confessed to being
an accessory in how many homicides?

233
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,000
Cases you would never make
in a million years

234
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,330
without our client's testimony.

235
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,420
If this was a larceny case,
or corruption, maybe.

236
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,010
But he's a federal law enforcement officer
that looked the other way

237
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,720
while class A felonies,
homicides, were committed.

238
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,890
Two men were murdered in front of him,
and he never said a damn word.

239
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,270
He didn't say a thing,
because he was afraid for his family.

240
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,910
Fisk tried to kill them all last night,

241
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,900
and Agent Nadeem is here today,
telling you everything.

242
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,270
Can you say
you'd do the same thing, Mr. Tower?

243
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,690
Our offer expires
when you walk out that door.

244
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,780
Full immunity, or we're advising
our client to run for his life.

245
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,780
Five years.

246
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,290
- On each count.
- No.

247
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,040
- You can't do murder and walk.
- Come on, Blake, no jail time.

248
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,500
You'll be the DA
who took down Wilson Fisk,

249
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,500
and the next stop on the Tower train
is the governorship.

250
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,220
Five years, on all counts.

251
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,390
Final offer.

252
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,100
Thank you for coming by, Mr. Tower.

253
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Wait.

254
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,650
He's right.

255
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,990
I did the crime.

256
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,870
And I need to keep my family safe.

257
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,580
I'll take it.

258
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,540
It's okay.

259
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,500
I'm good with this.

260
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,510
Let me make a call.

261
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,510
Sami, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

262
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,150
You might hear some stories about me,
some stuff that...

263
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,230
sounds like I did bad things.

264
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,320
No, I didn't do them.

265
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,910
But I didn't stop them
from happening, either.

266
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,160
And that's just as bad.

267
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,630
I was trying to keep
you and your mom safe.

268
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,500
That's all that matters to me.

269
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,050
I don't care what people say about me,

270
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,640
all I care about is...
what you say about me,

271
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,140
and that you get to live
the life that you want.

272
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
I love you, kid.

273
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,100
Hey. Feels good, right?

274
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
What? Letting Ray serve five years?

275
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,400
Any other lawyers,
he would've gone away a lot longer.

276
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,660
But I meant working together, you and me.

277
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,580
Doing what we're supposed to be doing
the way we're supposed to be doing it.

278
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,290
Yeah... it felt good.

279
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,620
Right?

280
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,670
I miss this, working together,
giving a shit about my clients.

281
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,090
Not just billing midtown jackholes
in six-minute increments.

282
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,550
Those jackholes pay well, though, huh?

283
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,220
What, are those new shoes?

284
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,100
Seems like you
got used to the money, Nelson.

285
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,600
So I'll get unused to it.

286
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,310
We should do this again.

287
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,350
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We're not there yet.

288
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,640
But we're getting there.

289
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Vanessa.

290
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,510
I'm sorry, I overslept.
Long flights do me in.

291
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,770
I heard the shower.
I thought you might be famished.

292
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,190
- My favorite.
- Yes, I remember.

293
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,910
More salt?

294
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,700
It's perfect.

295
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,470
Vanessa, something's bothering you.

296
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,430
Please tell me what it is.

297
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,860
While I was away, I was always surrounded
by your bodyguards.

298
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,320
"How are you, Ms. Marianna?"

299
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,700
"How is your day going, Ms. Marianna?"

300
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,040
I was always "fine."

301
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,420
The day was always "nice."

302
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,510
One day, I, um, found myself
on the Nervión River in Bilbao.

303
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,760
Hundreds of people...

304
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,970
Tourists posed for pictures, held hands...

305
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,890
kissed on the riverfront.

306
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,850
I was surrounded by people...

307
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,190
but I wasn't with them.

308
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,030
I was lonely.

309
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,580
Vanessa, we have both been lonely.

310
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,330
And I still am.

311
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:29,290
I'm here, surrounded by your things,
your people, even you...

312
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,470
but I still don't feel that I'm with you.

313
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,140
What can I do?

314
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,470
I'll do anything. Please, tell me.

315
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,860
I am sorry to bother you, sir,
but I'm afraid this cannot wait.

316
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,070
Not here.

317
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,410
I have to...

318
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,210
Forgive me, please.

319
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,540
Of course.

320
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,430
Never in front of Vanessa.

321
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,640
Tell me.

322
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,230
Agent Nadeem has not yet been located.

323
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,810
But my source tells me

324
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,730
that the state's grand jury
that was to be released this morning

325
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,280
has been held late.

326
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,860
What's more, courthouse security
has been dramatically increased.

327
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,570
These could be indications...

328
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,830
Nadeem is intending to testify.

329
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,410
That could be problematic.

330
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,460
Yes, it would, sir.

331
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,210
What's unclear to me
is how you failed to kill him!

332
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,800
Daredevil interfered.

333
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,220
The men responsible have been eliminated.

334
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,510
However, the ultimate responsibility
does rest with me.

335
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,480
If you would like my resignation,
I understand.

336
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,070
You protected her...

337
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,780
two years.

338
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,370
You kept Vanessa safe when I couldn't.

339
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
No, Felix. I want you to finish the job.

340
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:39,050
If you need assistance, call our friends.

341
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,600
Do whatever it takes.

342
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,180
I will not be indicted.

343
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,270
Hey, Tommy, I'll have two...

344
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,440
Two knishes with extra sauerkraut
and extra mustard.

345
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,070
It's 11:40.

346
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,860
You're a creature of habit.

347
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,250
This totally doesn't mean
that I forgive you, by the way.

348
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,130
- I'm trying to keep a low profile.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,090
You-know-who's people
are looking for me, so...

350
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,730
Well, after what happened
at the church,

351
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,210
so is every FBI agent
and reporter in the city.

352
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,970
Uh, your knishes?

353
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,970
Oh! Uh, here.

354
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,100
So, um... are we doing this?

355
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,230
If by "this" you mean
I tell you who Daredevil is, then no.

356
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,690
What I can tell you is who attacked
the Bulletin in Daredevil's suit.

357
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,860
Do you have a name?

358
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,860
Ben Poindexter.

359
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,160
The FBI agent who saved Fisk.

360
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Yeah, well,
apparently he made a good impression,

361
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,650
because he's working for him now.

362
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,120
- And you can prove this how?
- I don't have to.

363
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,500
In a couple of hours,
the head of Fisk's FBI detail

364
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,170
is going to testify to everything
in front of a grand jury.

365
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,380
Ray Nadeem
is going to turn state's witness.

366
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,380
- Wow.
- Yeah.

367
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,430
It's a hell of an exclusive. Welcome back.

368
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,470
No, see, actually,
it's not gonna be an exclusive.

369
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,060
Come on, Ellison, this is...
This is bigger than just our newspaper.

370
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,190
When Fisk had our offices attacked,
he was trying to silence the truth.

371
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,730
God help me.

372
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,070
Okay, so what is it, exactly,
that you want me to do?

373
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,160
I need you to call a press conference.

374
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,740
Just tell everyone
that Karen Page wants to make a statement.

375
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,680
This is from Wilson.

376
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,560
I was wondering where it had gone.

377
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,270
Hey, we haven't formally met yet.

378
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,190
I'm Agent Poindexter.

379
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,730
Dex.

380
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,990
If you need anything at all,
just think of me as the new James Wesley.

381
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,990
Pleasure to meet you.

382
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,870
Vanessa Marianna.

383
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,250
I've always told Wilson
he has great taste in art.

384
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,010
He does love to put
beautiful things on display.

385
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,010
Where did you find it?

386
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,310
Some lady had it.
Wilson couldn't get her to sell it.

387
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,940
Well, that must have been
very disappointing for him.

388
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,070
It's the painting in his collection
that means the most to us.

389
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,320
I figured that...

390
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,110
so I thought I'd ask her
just one last time.

391
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,540
Thank you, Agent Poindexter.

392
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,670
Perhaps you can arrange
to have it hung for us?

393
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,510
It'd be my pleasure, ma'am.

394
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,060
What about Nelson?

395
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,810
Foggy's ironing out some details
with the DA.

396
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,690
He's gonna meet us at the courthouse.

397
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,471
- Then let's get this over with.
- Not that one. This one.

398
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,570
Really?

399
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,990
Hey.

400
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,490
Mahoney tell you this could get rough?

401
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,620
He told me you're taking out Fisk.
That's all I need to hear.

402
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,490
Courthouse. No stops.

403
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,100
I need to ask you something.

404
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,240
You want to know about Daredevil.

405
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,580
I stepped off the path for a few weeks,
and it destroyed my life...

406
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,170
But your life,
you step on and off all the time.

407
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,840
It complicates my life, too.

408
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,970
- Trying to have it both ways.
- Does it?

409
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,260
I mean, your friends know who you are,
what you do.

410
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,930
My life almost got them killed.

411
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,760
And not for the first time.

412
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,230
I don't see how I can have it both ways.

413
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,770
But you already do.

414
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,980
I messed up,
and no matter what happens today...

415
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,900
I don't know
if my wife's ever coming back.

416
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,280
But your friends keep coming back.

417
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,410
I mean, how do you hold onto them?

418
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,790
It's not me.

419
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
It's them.

420
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,070
Light it up.

421
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,910
Get us out of here!

422
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,290
He's dead.

423
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,000
Draw your weapon.

424
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,790
There's a guy there.

425
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,080
I can't shoot blind. Anybody...

426
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,170
They're reloading, Ray! Fire your weapon!

427
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,630
There.

428
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,890
Through there.

429
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,720
- You got him.
- Let's go.

430
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,810
Wait! Ray! Wait!

431
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,200
Clear!

432
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,960
- We stick together. Understand?
- I know what I'm doing.

433
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,360
- I'll get us to the courthouse.
- Stop, Ray. Listen to me.

434
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
You need to trust me.

435
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,050
You pretend to lead me,
but you do what I say.

436
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,840
Stay down.
All right, there's two ahead of us.

437
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,940
All right. Up ahead,
there's a way out. This way.

438
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,980
Two o'clock. Go.

439
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,930
Bus. Take the bus.

440
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,510
Wait.

441
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,600
Okay, go.

442
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,020
Sit down. Wait for my cue.

443
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,110
Hello?

444
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,080
Hello? What's... what's happening?

445
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,290
Hello?

446
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,460
Hello? Is anybody there?

447
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,040
Hey...

448
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,450
Let's go. It's just up ahead.

449
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,580
Oh, shit. It's a cab.

450
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,960
I think I should drive.

451
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,640
Hey. Where are they?

452
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,600
- Late. Why?
- There's been an attack.

453
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,240
People got shot a few blocks from here.

454
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,520
- Oh, shit.
- They're locking down the building.

455
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,440
- I need to call my office.
- Hey. We're here.

456
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,360
- What the hell happened?
- Fisk knows he's going to testify.

457
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,080
Are you in any condition to?

458
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,370
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Okay. Let's go.

459
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,200
Okay, here's the deal.

460
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,370
After you testify, Tower will take you
for arraignment, then we'll bail you out.

461
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,290
What about my family?

462
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,930
Spoke with Seema. They'll be on
a flight to Delhi in the morning.

463
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,460
It's not forever. Just until we get Fisk
put away. And you'll get to say goodbye.

464
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,320
- I don't know how to thank you...
- Don't. Just go get Fisk.

465
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,310
- You all set?
- Yeah, Ellison really delivered.

466
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,810
Is it just me, or did our plan...

467
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,450
- Foggy, I'm begging you, don't say it.
- But it feels good, right?

468
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,610
The three of us working together
and saving the... Okay.

469
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,440
Look, I gotta go, okay?

470
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
Oh, man.

471
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,540
You do affirm that
all the testimony

472
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,120
that you are about to give
in the case now before the court

473
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,960
will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

474
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,880
This you do affirm under the pains
and penalties of perjury?

475
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,010
I do.

476
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,980
- Hey.
- Hey.

477
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,730
You ready for this?

478
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,610
Uh, no.

479
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,070
Okay, come on. Let's go.

480
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,450
Hi, I'm Karen Page.
I'm here to make a statement.

481
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,490
- Why didn't Daredevil kill you?
- Let her speak.

482
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,120
We have all been lied to.

483
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,540
All right? We've been manipulated

484
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,920
by a sociopath
who doesn't care about the truth...

485
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,420
or about who he hurts
or about anyone other than himself.

486
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,970
Last night, Wilson Fisk tried to have me
killed because I know the truth.

487
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,230
The man who was wearing the Daredevil suit
is not the real Daredevil.

488
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,310
He is an impostor

489
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,770
who is helping Wilson Fisk take back
control of New York's criminal underworld.

490
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,900
At this moment,
a grand jury is hearing testimony...

491
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,060
- You seeing this?
- ...Fisk is involved?

492
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,740
Can you identify
this impostor? This fake Daredevil.

493
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,740
Where did he come from?

494
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,700
Who's testifying
to the grand jury? Can you give us a name?

495
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay.

496
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,250
Your client was very convincing.

497
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,550
Keep him here
until the indictment comes in.

498
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,050
Don't worry. We'll hold up our end.

499
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,050
- Good. I'm counting on it.
- Thank you, sir.

500
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,590
You okay?

501
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,770
For a guy who's about to send
his family away and go to prison?

502
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,850
Yeah, I guess so.

503
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,690
You did good, Ray.

504
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,110
You heard everything through the wall,
didn't you?

505
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,780
You know that's kind of creepy?

506
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Oh, he knows.

507
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,200
I heard a man standing up to Fisk.

508
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,530
Your son will hear the same thing.

509
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,990
And it'll mean a lot to him.

510
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,370
I didn't know if we could
get this done today, but we did.

511
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,460
No...

512
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
you did.

513
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,880
So, thank you.

514
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,050
So, what now?

515
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,680
Hopefully, you'll serve out your sentence
in a minimum security prison.

516
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,560
Can't be sure.

517
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,010
Will I do the whole term?

518
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,640
My guess is
you won't serve the whole five.

519
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,180
Hopefully. Good behavior, you never know.

520
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:26,480
Willie Young,
789 West 144th Street.

521
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,280
Sara Torres, 612 East 78th Street.

522
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,780
What the hell? That's my address.

523
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,240
Holy shit.

524
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,870
Tom McGuinness, 707 Lovell Ave.

525
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,790
I'm sorry, they made me memorize them.

526
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,420
So just take it day by day.
That's all you can...

527
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,250
Oh, no.

528
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,210
Matt? What's wrong?

529
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,760
The jurors.

530
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,510
Fisk got to them.

531
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,020
At this time, the grand jury
has elected not to indict Wilson Fisk,

532
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,020
but this office, under my leadership,
will pursue every lead,

533
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,190
every piece of evidence that leads us
to uncovering the truth,

534
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,480
wherever we may find it.

535
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,040
We'll continue to cover
this breaking news story

536
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,360
as events unfold.

537
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,860
Karen Page,
this all started with you, didn't it?

538
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,320
"Started"? What do you mean?

539
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:18,160
You leaked the grand jury story,
and it was all a lie.

540
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
No, it's not a lie.

541
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,080
Is it a desperate attempt to boost
readership for the failing Bulletin?

542
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,040
Screw you, Jerry.
What's Fisk paying you, anyway?

543
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,720
Get out of here.

544
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,090
It's not gonna end this way, Ray.

545
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,840
We're not gonna let it.

546
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,380
The system will work.

547
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,760
You still believe that?

548
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,350
We've been here before. We can fix this.

549
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,310
Tower will impanel another grand jury
and try again.

550
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,730
We're not done here. Right, Matt?

551
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,730
I told you this would happen.

552
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,930
- I need to know where you're going.
- Gonna find Tower.

553
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,610
Make sure he tries again.

554
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,240
Right. Good.

555
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,110
When he gets back,
we'll get you someplace safe.

556
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,990
Fisk is unstoppable.

557
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,330
My family's never going to be safe.

558
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,000
Don't talk like that, Ray.

559
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,670
I'm sorry.

560
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,590
No...

561
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,930
I'm sorry.

562
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,980
How did this get here?

563
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,030
A gift from Agent Poindexter.

564
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,070
He persuaded the owner to part with it.

565
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,120
Did he?

566
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,330
I intended for the painting
to remain with her.

567
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,340
He said to think of him
as the new James Wesley.

568
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,970
- Is he?
- No.

569
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,310
But he is useful.

570
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,650
Is he dangerous?

571
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,690
Nothing to be concerned about.

572
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,070
I'll handle it.

573
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
How?

574
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,910
- It's not important.
- It is to me.

575
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,910
I think it's time we speak plainly.

576
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,540
Speak honestly.

577
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,170
I'm always honest with you.

578
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,170
When I first met you,
I was fascinated by your strength.

579
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:43,430
Your brutality so clear to me,
even as you hid it from me.

580
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:48,060
I wanted to observe everything you did.

581
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,190
And as I did, I fell in love with you.

582
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,980
But this?

583
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,690
If this is all we have...

584
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,030
it will leave me lonely, Wilson.

585
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,410
As lonely as I was in Spain.

586
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,700
When you stopped your man
from speaking in front of me, I...

587
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:12,040
I was reminded
that I am not a part of your life.

588
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,340
Not fully, and so not at all.

589
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,590
And this...

590
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,010
I don't want to admire your world.

591
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,850
I want to live inside of it with you.

592
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,730
Vanessa, it's one thing to know my work,

593
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,440
but it's another...

594
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,240
to dirty your hands with it.

595
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,160
My hands were never clean.

596
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,950
If you truly want me...

597
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,500
share your life with me.

598
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,830
Fully.

599
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,770
Come with me, please.

600
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,350
Hey, beautiful.

601
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,140
It's me.

602
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,810
I'm home.

603
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,450
You remember our wedding vows?

604
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,280
"I love you more than life itself."

605
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,620
I still do.

606
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,000
And, Sami, your name means "elevated."

607
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,300
And that's what you did for me.

608
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:09,970
Made my life better
in the most unexpected ways.

609
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:13,930
Elevate your mom now.

610
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,830
You're watching everyone.

611
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,130
Everyone I need to.

612
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,150
An update, please, Mr. Manning.

613
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,900
And speak freely.

614
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,780
I will no longer
keep anything from Vanessa.

615
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,150
Very good, sir.

616
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,120
Agent Nadeem has been located.

617
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,450
His testimony to the grand jury
remains sealed and inadmissible...

618
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,920
but given its public nature,

619
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,040
we should weigh the benefits
of keeping him alive.

620
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,260
Force Nadeem to stand trial
for the murder of Agent Winn,

621
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:34,260
turning the FBI against him
and discrediting him in the press.

622
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,100
My thoughts exactly, sir.

623
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:43,980
Wilson, what does Agent Nadeem
know about your business?

624
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,570
A considerable amount.

625
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,650
And is he determined to find ways
to hurt you? To hurt us?

626
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,950
Yes.

627
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,660
Don't you think it would be safer
to remove the threat?

628
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,210
Yes, I do.

629
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:13,550
If Agent Poindexter is useful,
perhaps he can help us with this problem.

630
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,310
- You'll let him know, won't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

631
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,260
I hoped it'd be you.

632
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:01,850
Hi, Ray.

633
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,310
Come on inside. Let's talk.

634
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,780
Come on, Dex. We both know
you're a better liar than that.

635
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,840
You want a private place to kill me.

636
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,780
You're in a tough spot, Ray. I get that.

637
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,080
It sounds hard. Really hard.

638
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:31,460
When he's done with you,
he'll bury you, too.

639
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,300
You know that, right?

640
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,430
I'm doing fine.

641
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:41,220
And you would be, too,
if you hadn't opened your mouth.

642
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,890
It's not too late
to turn things around, Dex.

643
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:53,820
Fisk manipulated you, just like he did me
and Tammy and everyone else.

644
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,450
I can help you cut a deal with the DA.

645
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,700
We can take him down, you and me.

646
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,330
Two federal agents... like we were before.

647
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,340
No, that's not gonna happen, Ray.

648
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,210
I'm more than a fed now.

649
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:19,220
I feel more myself
than I have in my whole life.

650
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,680
Fisk gave me that.

651
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,150
As long as I'm alive, my family's at risk.

652
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,450
Let's go, Ray.

653
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,740
I'm not going anywhere with you, Dex.

654
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:52,710
Whatever you need to do...
you do it here.

655
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,830
Thanks, Brett.

656
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,790
Yeah, okay.

657
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,730
- Matt, please...
- No. We tried it your way.
