1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,172
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,299
<i>For 7 years, I have fought
with only one goal...</i>

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:07,842
<i>to save my city,</i>

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,469
<i>but now a new threat
has emerged,</i>

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,179
<i>a danger so severe,
it has forced me</i>

6
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:13,139
<i>to leave my family
in order to face it,</i>

7
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,642
<i>and it won't be enough for me
to just be the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,310
<i>To prevent the crisis
that's coming,</i>

9
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:19,479
<i>I am going to have to become
someone else.</i>

10
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,981
<i>I am going to have
to become... something else.</i>

11
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,651
<i>Previously on "Arrow"...</i>

12
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,653
Earth-2 is... gone.

13
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,196
The destruction
of that Earth was

14
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:29,822
a necessary sacrifice.

15
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:33,076
Mar Novu is not trying to
prevent what's going to happen

16
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,827
because he's gonna be
what causes it.

17
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,539
John Diggle is
my adoptive father.

18
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,707
- Thanks, Mr. Diggles.
- Call me Dig.

19
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,293
We have to take out
the Deathstrokes.

20
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,380
Zoe!

21
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,017
Dad?

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,521
Dad?

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,484
Oh, my God. Dad!

24
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,990
W-William? William?

25
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,493
Hey.

26
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,123
Mia.

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,791
Mia?

28
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:24,669
Dad!

29
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,671
Well, you're
so young.

30
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,339
Dad?

31
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,658
What is this?
How did they get here?

32
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,261
I... I don't know.

33
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,390
Those are my kids.

34
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,517
Your kids.

35
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:41,978
Are you... are you okay?

36
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,939
H-how is this real?

37
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,233
Good question.
The last time I checked,

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,111
you didn't have an adult
daughter or any daughter.

39
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,696
We had a daughter...

40
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:54,449
and we named her Mia.

41
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:58,119
Felicity gave birth a few
months after we left Star City.

42
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,664
How? I... I didn't even
know she was pregnant.

43
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,207
We didn't
tell anyone.

44
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,376
We wanted to keep her
off the grid

45
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,836
to protect her.

46
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,963
That was only
a few months ago.

47
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,468
This is Novu.

48
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,053
You called me Dad.

49
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,387
You adopted me.

50
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,806
Remember?
It's Connor.

51
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:23,269
No. No. I... I...
I haven't.

52
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:27,774
He hasn't because
he hasn't yet.

53
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,818
Look. What are you
talking about?

54
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:32,779
I think we're
in the past.

55
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,698
- That is insane.
- Look at this place.

56
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,117
It's new,
and them!

57
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,702
No gray hair,
no wrinkles,

58
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:43,331
and we are staring
at our dad alive

59
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,291
instead of
at his tombstone.

60
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,834
I'm sorry.
What year is this?

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,587
2-2... uh, it's 2019.

62
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,341
What year is it
supposed to be?

63
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,385
2040.

64
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:07,103
Wait. So an hour ago, I was
just with Ben Turner's 6-year-old child,

65
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,870
and now he's an adult,
and I'm his father?

66
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,275
At least you didn't throw up
like you usually do.

67
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,443
Just saying.

68
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,088
I'm genuinely sorry
that both of you

69
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,154
found out this way,

70
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,908
about Mia,
about the Monitor. I'm...

71
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,494
Felicity and I wanted
to tell you.

72
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,114
Oliver, as far
as excuses go,

73
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,915
a cosmic being asking you
to sacrifice your life

74
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:29,293
to save the entire universe
is a... pretty good one.

75
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,422
Look. Those kids have
20 years of stuff we don't know.

76
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,924
When are we gonna
be able to ask them what happens?

77
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,651
I think we should give
them their space,

78
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,469
and when they're ready,
they'll open up.

79
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,805
Okay. Laurel's on her
way to Star City.

80
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,850
I can't believe
her entire Earth is just gone.

81
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,477
I don't understand.
Why didn't the Monitor bring her here?

82
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,062
Or grown-up JJ
or Zoe?

83
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,397
What game is
he playing?

84
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:50,565
I don't know,

85
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:53,526
but we have
to stop him.

86
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:54,819
How do we stop
a god?

87
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,197
I'm working on it.

88
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,284
Okay. How did this happen?
This can't be real.

89
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,077
Well, it is.

90
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,372
Hey. Are you okay?

91
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,459
I'm fine. Yeah.
Just please tell me

92
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,586
that you were able
to get JJ.

93
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,923
I had him,
and I was gonna... kill him,

94
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,092
and the next thing I know,
I'm... I'm here.

95
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,053
So he's still
out there.

96
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,264
You mean, out there
20 years in the future

97
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,075
unless you're talking
about the current JJ,

98
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,267
who'd be, like, what, 5?

99
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,019
And you're not gonna
thwick him.

100
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:30,938
Mia?

101
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,733
No, I'm not, okay?

102
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,526
How does this
even work?

103
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,733
All right, 'cause my dad doesn't
even know who I am,

104
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,906
and if he finds out
about JJ, what he did,

105
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,116
what I... what I
almost did,

106
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,577
he won't want to.

107
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,454
So don't tell him.

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,999
Don't tell
anyone anything.

109
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,502
- Are you serious?
- She's right.

110
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,548
This is original Team Arrow
we're talking about.

111
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:55,939
They are gonna know
something's up.

112
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,683
Do you want to tell Rene
his daughter's dead

113
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,134
or tell John that
his son's the one who did it?

114
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,054
What's done
is done.

115
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,106
Wow. This place
looks exactly like it did

116
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,358
when I was 13,

117
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:19,320
which makes sense
because I guess I still am.

118
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,113
Sorry about
the boxes.

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,157
Felicity and I left
pretty suddenly

120
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,867
to get
to the cabin,

121
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,744
and we
had planned to

122
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,622
come back here
with both of you at some point.

123
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,125
Yeah. That, um,
didn't really work out.

124
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,127
Because I died?

125
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,548
We don't know exactly.

126
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,675
You just sort of
disappeared.

127
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,139
So did, uh... looks
like the two of you

128
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,601
got a chance to...
to grow up with each other.

129
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:55,314
Um... actually, um,
Mia and I

130
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:58,067
just found out
about each other recently.

131
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,570
I never saw Felicity
growing up,

132
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,656
and... and after
I left here, I...

133
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,408
I never saw you again.

134
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,160
Yeah. After you died,
it was, um,

135
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,454
just me and mom
at the cabin.

136
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,626
I'm sorry that I wasn't there
for the two of you.

137
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,004
However, we are
here now.

138
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,548
Um, why don't we
sit down,

139
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:23,050
and you guys can
catch me up to speed or...

140
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,719
On 20 years?

141
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,555
It doesn't really
work that way.

142
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,558
Even if it did,
I'm just... I'm tired.

143
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:33,436
I want to sleep,
and I... you know?

144
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,357
Yep. Well, the bedroom
is right there.

145
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,318
Just please make
yourself at home, okay?

146
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,903
Yeah. Sure.

147
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:44,906
Night.

148
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,873
This is gonna be...
interesting.

149
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,291
Who are you calling?

150
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:01,130
Felicity. She needs to know
that the two of you are back.

151
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,007
- You can't.
- Why?

152
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:06,385
Look. I'm not exactly sure how this
time travel thing works.

153
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,180
Maybe we shouldn't...
bring Mom into this

154
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,848
until we have
a better understanding

155
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,017
of what... this is.

156
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,977
That's a good point.

157
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,124
William, tell me
something good

158
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,691
about the future,
please.

159
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,488
Well... you know
those computer projects

160
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,782
that I would work on
in my room

161
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,909
when I wasn't
talking to you?

162
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:32,662
- Yeah.
- I turned that teen angst

163
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:37,041
into a multibillion-dollar
tech empire.

164
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,793
- What?
- Kind of a mogul.

165
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,045
That's phenomenal.
That's, um...

166
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,757
I get the feeling
I'm gonna be really...

167
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,355
really, really proud
of how you turned out.

168
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:55,476
Yeah. Well, um...
I didn't just turn out.

169
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:59,188
Um... there's something
I should tell you.

170
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,276
I'm gay.

171
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:09,782
Yeah, buddy.
I know.

172
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,828
- You know?
- Yeah.

173
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,247
Felicity and I knew,

174
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,666
and we just, um...

175
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,712
well, we hoped that
you were gonna

176
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,297
come out to us when
you were comfortable.

177
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,591
You clearly didn't
get that chance,

178
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,345
and that's on me,
so... I'm sorry.

179
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,933
Dad, we all have the chance
to get to know each other now.

180
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:37,309
If your sister
will let me.

181
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,228
Mia will come around.

182
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,106
You know, she can be
a little... a little bit stubborn

183
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,984
and... hard to reach
sometimes.

184
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,861
Shocker. Where'd she
get that from?

185
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,989
Mom, I guess.

186
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,040
My husband
needs help.

187
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,001
Um, did you check in
at the desk?

188
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,294
We're donors here.

189
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,297
Hold this.

190
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,133
I'm just gonna
have a look.

191
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,471
Run! Bomb!

192
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,655
<i>Starling General
was attacked last night</i>

193
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:35,242
<i>after a bomb was found
inside Archroyal Capital CEO</i>

194
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,702
<i>Macmillan Fairfield.</i>

195
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,913
<i>Authorities believe
the infamous terrorist</i>

196
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,874
<i>Deathstroke orchestrated
the attack.</i>

197
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,085
Please tell me the city's
better in the future.

198
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,003
Yeah, yeah,
definitely.

199
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,922
- You think this is Slade?
- No. No, no.

200
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,289
I have A.R.G.U.S.
Keeping tabs.

201
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,420
He's currently
in Buredunia,

202
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,748
which is nowhere
near Star City.

203
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,552
Neither is his son,
Kane Wolfman.

204
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,012
So this is
someone new?

205
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,598
Yep. Someone has co-opted
the Deathstroke mask,

206
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,445
and they're using it
to terrorize the city.

207
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:00,518
We need motive.

208
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,603
Well, the vic is some rich
Wall Street type,

209
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,271
and those guys
are easy to hate.

210
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:05,940
We're not all bad.

211
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,818
- He's a billionaire.
- Say what?!

212
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,529
Please tell me Zoe is, too.
How is Zoe?

213
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,114
I mean, are you guys
still friends?

214
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,660
Yeah. She's...
you'd be proud.

215
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,080
Hello, bunker!

216
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,207
Oh, it feels so good to
be back.

217
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:24,518
Wait. Are those
the kids from the future?

218
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,936
Those are definitely
the kids from the future!

219
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,187
Oh, my God, and excuse me.
When were you gonna tell me

220
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,855
about this, Councilman Ramirez?
This is so cool.

221
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,023
I may have had
coffee on the plane,

222
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,525
and by "may have,"
I mean I definitely did have it.

223
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,926
It's Candidate Ramirez.
We don't know if I win yet.

224
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,573
Uh, did you miss the part where
these kids are from the future?

225
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:41,517
Okay. Rene, if you really
want to know, you become mayor.

226
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,353
Seriously?
Hoo hoo hoo!

227
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,896
Oh, that's a text
from D.

228
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,481
I will let her know
about Slade

229
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:50,401
and gloat that I'm
gonna be her boss.

230
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,071
Uh, William, we should,
uh, go, let them work.

231
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,549
Wait.
But I just got here,

232
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:57,116
and I have
so many questions,

233
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,802
starting with why did nobody
say anything about my beard?

234
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,146
Good to see you, Curtis.
Your beard looks tremendous, okay?

235
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,123
I mean, work or otherwise,
I'd like you to stay.

236
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,791
Yeah. No. I just, um...

237
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,626
I'd rather see
the city than the bunker.

238
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,004
Let's go.

239
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,049
I can't believe
that's your son, that's William.

240
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,903
I can, however, definitely
believe that that is your daughter.

241
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:17,928
- Okay.
- Yeah.

242
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,779
Uh, speaking of which,
I'm a little upset

243
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,158
you didn't tell me about her,
but that's okay.

244
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:24,518
I forgive you.
So why'd you call in the big guns?

245
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,187
- You know Earth-2?
- Yeah.

246
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,689
Well, yeah. It was destroyed
by a wave of energy.

247
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,859
This fabric was clipped by it,
and I would like you

248
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,528
to try and help me
figure out what it is.

249
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,655
I can... I can track down
some equipment.

250
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,616
It might...
take a bit.

251
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,868
The reason why
would help?

252
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,621
It's a wave of energy that's
powerful enough to destroy a planet,

253
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,415
so it's probably powerful
enough to stop a god,

254
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,836
which is... what we're
doing now.

255
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,255
God. You said god.
Um, so the

256
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,156
fate of the universe
is in my hands.

257
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,552
Cool, cool, cool.
Yeah. You guys... I got it. Ahem.

258
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:02,973
Hey. Lyla is still
off the grid,

259
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,893
but um, she'll be very
happy to see you.

260
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,438
You know, we always wanted
a brother for JJ.

261
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,235
- You and he close?
- Yeah. Best friends.

262
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,569
Glad to hear that.

263
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,714
I didn't know this was
bring your kid to work day.

264
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,281
Eh. Thought I might
be able to help.

265
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,951
Connor was an agent at an
organization called Knightwatch.

266
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,370
It makes A.R.G.U.S. look
like a kindergarten class.

267
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,936
The Canaries are
comparable, though.

268
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,122
Canaries?

269
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,960
Forget it.
What do you got?

270
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,504
Uh, found this
on the vic,

271
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:34,838
what was left of him.

272
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,006
May I?

273
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,509
Yeah.

274
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,803
I've seen
this before.

275
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,639
A, um, terrorist
organization,

276
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,599
they use these
to deliver messages.

277
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,184
Do you have
a black light?

278
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,187
Yeah, but we ran the inks on it already.
Nothing turned up.

279
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:54,733
That is because you
checked it dry.

280
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,486
Whoa. Okay.
So that's our motive.

281
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:58,904
That's good work, Connor.

282
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,949
Is there something else
you recognize?

283
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,909
No. Uh, that's it.

284
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,957
And that is Mia,
so I should probably...

285
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,884
Go. Go, go, go.
I'll catch up with you later.

286
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,878
<i>It can't really
be JJ, can it?</i>

287
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,714
This all started
the night we got here.

288
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,799
Maybe JJ came back, too.

289
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,236
What, and the first thing
he decides to do is blow something up?

290
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,344
It doesn't make
any sense.

291
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,971
It does if you
know my brother.

292
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,515
"Star City's cancer
is the rich"...

293
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,600
it's JJ's favorite
catchphrase.

294
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,145
Okay. We should tell Dad
and the team.

295
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:34,189
Not a chance.
This is our mess to clean up.

296
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,774
But we could use
their help.

297
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,485
I mean, maybe if JJ
sees John, then...

298
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,653
He won't care.

299
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,780
JJ will kill Dad
if he gets in his way.

300
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,282
This is on us.

301
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,743
It's on us to
avenge Zoe.

302
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,184
Well, then first,
we need to find him.

303
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,208
All right.
You know him best.

304
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,753
You know
the Deathstrokes.

305
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,212
Where would he go?

306
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,341
Where it all began.

307
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,637
Are you sure this
is the place?

308
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,515
20 years from now, this
place is galaxy one,

309
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,061
but 2019, it's where
the Deathstrokes started.

310
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,355
Oh. I am getting
a case of deja vu

311
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,148
in the worst
possible way.

312
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,441
You stay out
of sight.

313
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,776
Connor and I
got this.

314
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,152
Wait what?

315
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,083
He's dead.

316
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,086
Something's not right.

317
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,801
Don't move...

318
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,094
or we all go boom.

319
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,680
Frak!

320
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,224
JJ.

321
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,230
Oh, crap.

322
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,732
Why did you
do it, JJ?

323
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,275
Why did you kill her?

324
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,570
Damn it, JJ!
Answer me!

325
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,198
Who the hell is JJ?

326
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,867
Grant.

327
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,703
Incoming.

328
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,081
Evac now!

329
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,506
Oh, great. Looks like
we made it back

330
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,633
just in time to walk
into a bomb trap.

331
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,855
- How'd you find us?
- Later. We have to move.

332
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,308
Might be a bit
of a problem.

333
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,477
Buy us a few seconds.

334
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:37,604
On my mark.

335
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,691
Three... two... one...

336
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,360
Go!

337
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,195
Well, at least we
didn't die.

338
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,305
It's a good thing
we were tracking a victim,

339
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,540
or you would have been
in worse shape than that drive.

340
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,816
At least it's still
in one piece.

341
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,133
Maybe I can recover
the data.

342
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,403
Maybe you can explain to all of us
what you were doing there

343
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,428
with no backup.

344
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,738
We can take care
of ourselves.

345
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,763
That's not
the point, Mia.

346
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,390
What were you
looking for?

347
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,143
In the future,
that building is

348
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,769
the Deathstroke
home base.

349
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,688
The leader's
Grant Wilson.

350
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,191
Slade's other son.
Surprise, surprise.

351
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,152
Were you ever planning
on sharing that information

352
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,359
with the rest
of the class?

353
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,282
- No.
- Clearly your daughter.

354
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,843
So if you knew
it was Grant,

355
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,410
then why did you
call him JJ?

356
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,579
I heard you yell
his name.

357
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,206
What's going on here?

358
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,975
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

359
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,000
Then you tell me,
Connor!

360
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,841
We came back,

361
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,802
so we thought maybe
JJ did, too.

362
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,989
That's why we didn't tell you
about the Deathstrokes.

363
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,866
Connor, I don't understand what
you're talking about.

364
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,268
In the future, Grant
trains a new leader,

365
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,271
someone who eventually
takes over the Deathstrokes.

366
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:04,983
It's JJ.

367
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,777
You told me
JJ was fine!

368
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,320
Dad, I'm sorry.

369
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,739
- There's something else.
- William.

370
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,741
Look. They have
a right to know,

371
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,993
and I'm done holding
onto this.

372
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,456
Future Star City
is a terrible place.

373
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,417
It's run by gangs,
the cops are corrupt,

374
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,794
politicians, too.

375
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,004
Does that include me?

376
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,817
We're
trying to save it,

377
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,134
but that meant
stopping JJ,

378
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,530
and that's what we were doing
right before we came here.

379
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,305
We... we thought
we could, but...

380
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,936
Zoe was
with Mia, and...

381
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,273
And what?

382
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,402
JJ killed her.

383
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,739
I'm so sorry, Rene.

384
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,624
Rene! Rene, stop, man.
Let's talk!

385
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,835
Talk about what, huh?

386
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,396
About how your son
killed my daughter?

387
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,963
Look, man. I know
you're angry, okay?

388
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,923
I'm shook, too.
My son's a murderer, Rene,

389
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,133
a murderer,

390
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,778
but, man, now that we
know what went on,

391
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,154
maybe we can do something
to change it.

392
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,263
Change it how?

393
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,283
What if what we do
today doesn't make

394
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,142
a damn difference
about tomorrow?

395
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,771
This is my fault.

396
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,651
I'm sorry. I should have
told you sooner.

397
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,278
Then tell me now,
Connor!

398
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,323
Everything.

399
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,287
When you took me in,
I was angry

400
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,623
and rebellious,

401
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:47,377
but you... you refused
to give up on me.

402
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,173
Man, you straightened
me out, made me who I am,

403
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,634
a soldier just like you...

404
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,807
JJ, he resented it.

405
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,727
You know, it was like
I had stole the love

406
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,103
that should have
been his.

407
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,773
Maybe if I had been
a better son

408
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,941
JJ would have never
broken bad

409
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,652
and Zoe would
still be alive.

410
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,989
Dad, please
say something.

411
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,199
Dad?

412
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,621
Connor, since the moment
you got here,

413
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,582
you have done nothing
but lie to me,

414
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:26,958
to all of us.

415
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,462
What do you want
me to say?

416
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,761
Zoe was fighting to fix exactly
what her dad helped cause.

417
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,013
That's why she was
a Canary like both of you.

418
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,949
You guys had a whole
network of them in the city.

419
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,142
And that's what Connor
was talking about earlier.

420
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,311
And yet we still
couldn't save the city.

421
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,664
After Rene walled
off the Glades,

422
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,189
the scope was
just too big,

423
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,293
and ever since the wall came down,
we've been fighting the Deathstrokes,

424
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,860
trying to make
things better, but...

425
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,321
I just still
don't understand.

426
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,115
I mean, JJ adores Zoe.

427
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,681
How could he do
something like this?

428
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,076
Seemed pretty easy
for him,

429
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,329
so how about we stop
mourning poor, innocent JJ

430
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,206
and accept who he
actually is?

431
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,292
Look, all that matters right now
is stopping Grant Wilson

432
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,253
before he screws up
everyone's future.

433
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,214
What else can you
tell me about him?

434
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,341
Just the broad strokes.

435
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,968
Grant made a name
for himself doing

436
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,487
pretty much exactly
what he's doing now,

437
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,804
targeting the rich,

438
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,472
appealing to
the disenfranchised.

439
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:23,765
They became cult heroes,

440
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,559
which is how he
seduced JJ.

441
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,852
Any more specifics?

442
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,621
Grant's home base
just got blown up.

443
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,397
That... that never
happened before.

444
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,190
We're in new territory now.

445
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,860
How long to
access the drive?

446
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,155
Uh, more than a few,
less than a year.

447
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,116
I'm gonna go check
on Rene.

448
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,496
We should be out there
doing something.

449
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,206
We will be

450
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,000
once we know
Grant Wilson's plan.

451
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,634
Are you crazy?
How can you not like mint chip?

452
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,303
It tastes like
toothpaste.

453
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,514
Aunt Dinah? I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

454
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,350
Hey, kiddo.
Give me a squeeze.

455
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,606
You want to talk
to my dad, huh?

456
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,167
- I'll go start scooping.
- Hey, hey.

457
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,609
Don't eat all
the ice cream.

458
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,099
How am I supposed to
wake up every morning

459
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,296
knowing how many days
we have left together?

460
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,300
By trying to change
what happens,

461
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,596
trying every single day.

462
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,020
- We should talk.
- Ha.

463
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:54,523
What are you doing?

464
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,316
I'm going to the hospital
bomb site.

465
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,776
Maybe Dinah
missed something.

466
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,945
- Mia.
- I'm not gonna stand around

467
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,112
and waste time.

468
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,198
Look. I know what's
driving you right now.

469
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,366
You lost a teammate.

470
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,159
I... I... I've been there.

471
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,828
I... I can help.
I'm here to help.

472
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,413
You know, I survived
my whole life without you.

473
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,165
I don't need you
to play dad now.

474
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,334
Hey. I'm not playing dad.
I am simply telling you

475
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,270
that it is not tactically
wise to go out there

476
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,255
- by yourself...
- Fine. I'll take Laurel.

477
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,965
When you are letting
your decisions

478
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,175
be driven
by your emotions.

479
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,844
Trust me. I've been there.

480
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,011
You don't get a say.

481
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,888
You gave up that right
when you left

482
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,140
me and Mom alone
in that cabin.

483
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,102
How could you just
abandon us?

484
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,080
Because I chose to keep you safe,
and I chose right.

485
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,605
You just wanted
to be a hero,

486
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,067
so you put your mission
above your family.

487
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,697
Don't worry. You'll learn
to live without me pretty easy,

488
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,175
just like I learned
to live without you.

489
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,200
Mmm.

490
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,787
I'm not letting you go
out there.

491
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,498
Nyssa Al Ghul
trained me.

492
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,667
You want to see
how well?

493
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,476
I'm not gonna fight you.
I'm your father.

494
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,588
Really? Because
from where I stand,

495
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,298
you're just some guy
in my way.

496
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,551
Mia...

497
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:08,638
I'll go with you.

498
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,104
Let's go.

499
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,572
Uh... Dad, I know
this is bad timing,

500
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:26,948
but you should
see this.

501
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,158
It's live.

502
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,456
<i>6 years ago, my father
rained terror down on this city.</i>

503
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,584
<i>He was short-sighted, foolish.</i>

504
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,586
<i>This city has a cancer,</i>

505
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,255
<i>the one percent
who control industry.</i>

506
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,715
<i>I will excise it.</i>

507
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,344
<i>Our siege of Star City
begins tonight.</i>

508
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,388
This might be
how it starts.

509
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,516
This is the beginning
of the future.

510
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,772
Why would Grant give
us advanced warning?

511
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,231
It seems too easy.

512
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,359
That's because it is.

513
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,423
Look, Grant may be
planning an attack,

514
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,566
but it won't be
on the rich.

515
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,614
That video's a mislead.

516
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,241
This kind of deception is
a Deathstroke special.

517
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,494
How do you know
that?

518
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,287
I was undercover
with them for a while,

519
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,248
a last-ditch attempt
to get through to JJ.

520
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,906
Okay. So if this is a bait and switch,
what's the switch?

521
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,229
What do you think
Grant's planning?

522
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,588
Something
a whole lot bigger.

523
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,882
I just don't know
what exactly.

524
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,968
Everything happening
with the Deathstrokes is

525
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,219
different now.

526
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,346
Well, I've got some
good news.

527
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,306
I managed to extract
the data from the drive,

528
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,033
but, surprise, surprise,
it's encrypted,

529
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,309
and since I'm not
an expert

530
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,436
in early 21st-century
decryption algorithms,

531
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:41,481
I've called in
someone who is... Curtis.

532
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,608
Great. Now what about
Mia and Laurel?

533
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,819
We need to focus
on tracking down Grant.

534
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,346
Felicity's search algorithm should
still be on the computer.

535
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,906
Way ahead of you.

536
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,793
Wow. Mom really liked
playing fast and loose

537
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,025
with
the Fourth Amendment, huh?

538
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:54,828
Yeah.

539
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,622
Any chatter
from A.R.G.U.S.?

540
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,458
No. No, no, no.
They said they'll keep us posted.

541
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,408
Hey. I spoke
to Rene, by the way.

542
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,340
Well, I'm quite sure
he's not willing to talk to me.

543
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,510
No, but I do know
someone who is.

544
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:20,979
Are you avoiding him?

545
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,981
No.

546
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:32,949
Maybe.

547
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,347
I've never dealt with
anything like this before.

548
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,664
My head is still
spinning.

549
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:43,251
I... I... I want to blame someone.
I just don't know who.

550
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,339
John, we all failed
to save this city.

551
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,550
Yeah, Dinah,
but I'm his father,

552
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,552
so it's on me.

553
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,138
So you did pick
who to blame.

554
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,312
All this talk
about JJ got me

555
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,981
thinking about Andy,
how I failed him,

556
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:10,236
so yeah, the blame is
definitely on me.

557
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,447
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told Rene

558
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,450
because it's the same
thing I've been telling myself.

559
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,203
Knowing what's happened

560
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:22,290
can either destroy us
or save us.

561
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,959
We've seen our worst.

562
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,754
Now let's be our best.

563
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,653
In the future,
do they still use

564
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,721
the phrase
"wild goose chase"?

565
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,385
If you're bored,
you can go.

566
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:39,599
I don't need
a babysitter.

567
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,602
No, but you might
need backup

568
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,562
when you try and kill
Grant Wilson.

569
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,067
How did you know?

570
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,278
Oh. Well, clearly
no one has informed you

571
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,364
that I used to play
for team villain,

572
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:58,118
and I can spot a murderous
intent a million miles away.

573
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,907
So what, are you gonna try
and talk me out of it now,

574
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,039
tell me to listen
to my dad or...

575
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:07,001
Oh, God, no. I would never
tell anyone to listen to Oliver Queen.

576
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,045
No offense,

577
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:13,299
but I'm not exactly a very
big fan of your father's.

578
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,761
He's kind of a dick,
but you are a grown woman,

579
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:20,265
and if you want to
kill this guy, then have at it,

580
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,143
but I just want to
know why.

581
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,312
Because locking him up
isn't gonna change anything.

582
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:29,149
He escapes every time.

583
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,442
Why he's
such a cult hero

584
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,278
among all the worst
here in Star City.

585
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,822
- Including future JJ.
- Exactly.

586
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,826
Look, Grant has to die
so Zoe can live.

587
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,916
I don't know anything
about changing timelines,

588
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,956
but I am something
of an expert on vengeance,

589
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:48,251
and getting it,
it doesn't do anything

590
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:49,752
but cause you more pain.

591
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,023
So, what, you're an expert on
talking people out of murder?

592
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,048
Kind of.

593
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,511
I had to when Felicity
wanted to take down Ricardo Diaz.

594
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,889
My mom tried
to kill someone?

595
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,016
No, because I talked her
out of it.

596
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,767
And, look, I get it.

597
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,769
You and your mom,
you're both women

598
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,956
who won't allow themselves
to be talked out of anything,

599
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,356
and I appreciate that,

600
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:16,738
but Felicity, she never
regretted changing her approach,

601
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,658
so maybe you should try doing
things differently, too.

602
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,715
There you are.

603
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,508
Mia's back.

604
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,012
You crack the drive?

605
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,472
Curtis almost
has it.

606
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,679
God, you know, it's kind of
annoying how good he is.

607
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:49,187
Plus he's got this
perfect husband-slash-life,

608
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,148
not that I'm jealous
or anything.

609
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,361
Let me know when it's
done, okay?

610
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:01,407
You know, I have been told
by several ex-boyfriends

611
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,202
that I do this
moody, broody thing

612
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,745
when I'm problem-solving.

613
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,914
Guess it must be
genetic.

614
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,166
It's Mia, right?

615
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,543
I didn't want her
to go out there.

616
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,605
Well, then you should
have made her stay.

617
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:16,756
What, put her in timeout?
She's an adult.

618
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,716
Yeah, and like an adult,
she makes mistakes.

619
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,009
She's right.

620
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:24,013
I chose to go
with the Monitor.

621
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,390
I abandoned her.

622
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,101
I haven't earned
a say.

623
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,668
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
she doesn't want you to have one.

624
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,231
Or... or that you shouldn't,

625
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,318
and I'm saying that
from experience.

626
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,316
You have kids
in the future?

627
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,531
Oh, God, no.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

628
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,741
Kids are a miracle
or... whatever,

629
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,660
but I was actually
referring to

630
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,163
when I left you to go
live with grandma and grandpa.

631
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,010
Yeah, that one's
still pretty fresh for me.

632
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:52,542
Right.

633
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,919
I... I... I...

634
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,713
I thought you
hated my guts.

635
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,715
I hated you
for abandoning me.

636
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,591
- I tried.
- True,

637
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,510
but I wanted you
to try harder,

638
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,097
push a little more.

639
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,474
I think that's all any child
wants from their parents.

640
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm sorry.

641
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,025
It's okay.

642
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,903
Dad, I am glad that
you're in my life

643
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,866
then and now,

644
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:27,744
and Mia will be, too.

645
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,335
Um, I hate to interrupt father-son time,
but we got something.

646
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,380
So Grant is trying to
one-up his father.

647
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,257
The siege version 2.0
is tonight,

648
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,884
and this time,
Mirakuru is out,

649
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,594
and coordinated
bomb attacks are in.

650
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,763
- How many?
- Lots,

651
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,766
and Grant has them all
connected to a remote detonator,

652
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,184
probably a phone.

653
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,020
The good news is...
and I use that term very loosely...

654
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,315
is that he set up a relay device
underneath downtown.

655
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:00,026
So we disable the relay device,
we turn off the bomb.

656
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:01,361
Okay. What about Grant?

657
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,862
He's holed up
underground,

658
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,629
where the lines converge
at Water Street.

659
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:05,990
History repeats itself.

660
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,477
Well, maybe we can stop
the attack

661
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,257
by running the same play
we ran last time.

662
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,372
No. Someone told me
the only way

663
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,291
to change the future is to start doing
things differently now.

664
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,212
- Rene, look...
- John, we're good.

665
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,588
You, too, Connor.

666
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,399
I can't be mad
at either of you for something

667
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,175
I will never
let happen.

668
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,179
All right. We set up one team
to go after Grant,

669
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:29,698
one team to destroy
the relay device,

670
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,809
but we also need to
keep the public calm this time.

671
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,578
Last I checked,
the police are still good,

672
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,813
and I'm still captain,
future be damned.

673
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,540
I'll join you.
I got to do something

674
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,607
for the Glades
from there.

675
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,419
- What about the three of us?
- William, I think it would be

676
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,237
best if you stayed
and helped Curtis.

677
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,906
Mia and Connor, I'd like
for the two of you to come with us.

678
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,385
Rene said it. We have to do things
differently this time.

679
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,410
Agreed?

680
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,830
- All right.
- This is my favorite part.

681
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:55,748
Suit up.

682
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,208
Yes!

683
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,302
- Stay close, please.
- Where are we?

684
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,322
<i>You're in the service
tunnels underneath the city.</i>

685
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,426
<i>Basically, you all are
in "The Shawshank Redemption."</i>

686
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,850
"The Shawshank" what?

687
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,870
"The Shawshank Redemption."
It's... are there no movies in the future?

688
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,497
- <i>Curtis!</i>
- Oh, right. Staying on task.

689
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,321
<i>Sorry. I'm a little bit
out of practice, guys.</i>

690
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,649
<i>Spartan, what's
your status?</i>

691
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,318
We're at the east end.

692
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,320
Looks like someone
beat us here.

693
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,825
<i>Tonight, we take
back this city</i>

694
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,785
<i>from the cancer
which has plagued it.</i>

695
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,746
<i>We will set
its citizens free.</i>

696
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:39,250
We will save this city
from itself.

697
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:43,212
Stand beside me.
Take back what is rightfully yours.

698
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,632
Let's make Star City
great again.

699
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,842
Where are his men?

700
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,344
Mia, you should get
behind me.

701
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,892
I need three units
at the docks

702
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,435
and another two
in Pennytown, okay?

703
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,312
- Hey.
- Yup. Hey.

704
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:00,730
What's up?

705
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,857
Got a press conference
in the Glades in the works.

706
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:03,983
Great.

707
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,661
Brought you a new addition
to the drunk tank.

708
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:07,737
Watch him for a sec?

709
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,783
Hey. You got the time?

710
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,162
It's five to nine.

711
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,213
What the hell
is that?

712
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,763
Bomb!

713
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,518
We're almost
at the relay.

714
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,068
Well, that can't
be good.

715
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,160
Mia! Ohh!

716
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:00,206
Raise your hand
if you know how to disarm a bomb.

717
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,501
William, it's
an intervalometer.

718
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:04,710
Where'd you
learn that?

719
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:07,755
From you.

720
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:09,233
It's most likely
pulsating

721
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:10,484
in a consistently
synchronized pattern.

722
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:11,902
So it will have
a transfer switch embedded

723
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:12,927
into the mainframe.

724
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,054
Look at us...
Holt and Smoak 2.0.

725
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,391
There should be two wires
plugged into the console.

726
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:43,725
<i>You're gonna disconnect
the red one.</i>

727
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,293
<i>Do not touch the blue one,</i>

728
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,128
<i>or else very bad things
will happen.</i>

729
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,717
Unh!

730
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,344
What the hell?!

731
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,103
The device has been
neutralized.

732
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,639
I guess things have never
not been tense around here, huh?

733
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,738
Yeah. I like to cope
by stress eating.

734
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,906
- Gummy bear?
- Thanks.

735
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,744
This isn't over.

736
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,871
- Yes, it is.
- Mia!

737
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,542
Get out of my way.

738
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:27,710
No.

739
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,047
Hate me if you want.

740
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:34,800
I'm not letting you
do this.

741
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,357
Just got off the phone
with Gotham City PD.

742
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,835
Grant Wilson is being
prepped and transferred to Blackgate,

743
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,569
where he will spend
the next 20 to life.

744
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,656
We will keep an eye on him.
He's not going anywhere.

745
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,842
Takes the Deathstrokes off the board

746
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,159
for the foreseeable future.

747
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,953
Literally. Let's hope
it changes things somehow.

748
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,040
- For Zoe.
- And for JJ.

749
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,292
Here's hoping.

750
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,961
Or we make our own hope.

751
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:18,281
You guys really held
your own tonight.

752
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,555
Well, my keyboard
warrior skills are strong.

753
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:24,701
Uh, you know, Curtis went
right back to analyzing that fabric,

754
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,365
so I'm just gonna go
see if he needs help.

755
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,062
Thank you, William.

756
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,235
You okay?

757
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,988
- I would have killed him.
- I know,

758
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,659
and I know you
didn't want to.

759
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:45,788
Thank you.

760
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,999
Come on.

761
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:53,963
Hey.

762
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,343
You ready to go home?

763
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:01,679
You don't have to
do that.

764
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,182
I don't want to be a reminder
of everything bad

765
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,350
that happened to JJ

766
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,352
- and to your family.
- Connor.

767
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,237
You are my family, son.

768
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,199
Look. I'm sorry, Dad.

769
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,244
- I... I really am. I...
- It's okay.

770
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,372
It's okay.
I'm sorry, too.

771
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:30,416
We're gonna figure
this out.

772
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,147
Are you still
giving that speech tomorrow?

773
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:38,048
Yes. You really think
we changed things tonight?

774
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,341
In the future?

775
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,548
You mean in like
a baby Hitler kind of way?

776
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:43,012
"Butterfly Effect"?

777
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,222
- Come on.
- Hey.

778
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,109
If you want me to stop
training Zoe, I will.

779
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,185
Nah. I can't keep her
in a bubble

780
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,895
just like you can't
stop being a cop

781
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,105
and I can't stop
running for office.

782
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:54,940
So don't.

783
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,942
Not all of the future
was bad, right?

784
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,945
Just do
the good stuff.

785
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,573
I mean, the Canary network's
not a bad idea.

786
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,658
Could be useful.

787
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,454
Then why wait for a future
we can start making now?

788
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,295
So this is what you
wanted to show me,

789
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,963
Grandpa's grave?

790
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:20,912
Did your mother ever
mention him?

791
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,176
Not really.

792
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,095
I suppose she wouldn't
know what to say.

793
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:26,597
I barely do.

794
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,308
You weren't close?

795
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,310
I didn't really get
to know the real him

796
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,729
until after he died,
and, uh...

797
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,691
Look, I don't want
that to be us.

798
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:44,740
You've, um... you've
lost people, right?

799
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,409
Yeah. Too many.

800
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,664
Does the guilt
ever leave?

801
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:54,708
No.

802
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,796
You can learn to
live with it.

803
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,008
I can help you
with that, Mia,

804
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,178
if you'd like.

805
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,482
<i>I've been a part
of the Glades my whole life.</i>

806
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,609
Born and raised,

807
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:23,988
and if you're from here,

808
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:28,158
you know we've been
counted out a lot.

809
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,787
We've been told
we're low-income,

810
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,497
we're uneducated,

811
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,708
we're a lost cause.

812
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,753
And if you hear that
enough times,

813
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:44,592
all you can do is hope that
things will get better later.

814
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,095
Now, I don't know
about you guys,

815
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,556
but I'm tired of waiting.

816
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,034
<i>I'm tired of waiting
for the day when</i>

817
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,859
<i>people stop being afraid
of the Glades</i>

818
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,236
<i>and start coming here
to raise their families,</i>

819
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:08,574
<i>to find opportunities
for growth and change,</i>

820
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,535
<i>to uplift our brothers
and sisters to be better</i>

821
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,454
<i>than we ever were before.</i>

822
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,290
<i>If we keep waiting,</i>

823
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,251
<i>we might run out of time.</i>

824
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,921
<i>That's why from here on out,</i>

825
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,299
<i>we don't wait
for our future in the Glades.</i>

826
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:29,386
<i>We make our future now.</i>

827
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:32,306
Special delivery.

828
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:36,810
Ohh! Okay. This is the best late-night
snack you can ever have.

829
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,312
Want one?

830
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:41,732
Why not?

831
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,406
Yes, Curtis.

832
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,617
Do you want the long version
or the short version?

833
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:52,826
Please say the long one

834
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,179
because I would love to
geek out on this science.

835
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:55,443
<i>- Did you know that...</i>
- Curtis.

836
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,374
Short it is. Whatever it is
it is possible to replicate,

837
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,668
but there's a catch...
a couple catches, actually.

838
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,295
<i>- Okay.</i>
- One... I don't have the tools to do it.

839
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,589
Two... it is super illegal

840
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:06,966
because it requires
plutonium,

841
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,467
you know,
the bomb-making kind.

842
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,844
<i>Luckily, there's a guy,
a military general.</i>

843
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,054
Okay. Where is he?

844
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,430
Russia.

845
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,739
You must be
the Monitor.

846
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:31,907
How do you know?

847
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:33,867
Because no human
would actually wear

848
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,536
something
so ridiculous.

849
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,038
You ache for the world
you lost,

850
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:41,250
and I possess the power
to restore it.

851
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,168
You can bring
back my Earth?

852
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,753
The recovery
of your universe

853
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,172
will require
a single task.

854
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:50,175
What kind of task?

855
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,762
You must betray
Oliver Queen.

856
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,293
Greg, move your head!
