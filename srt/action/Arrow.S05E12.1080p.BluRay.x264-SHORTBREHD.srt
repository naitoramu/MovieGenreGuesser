1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,970
<i>My name is
Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,263
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,764
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,391
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,973
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,933
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,976
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,446
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:22,989
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,487
Really sorry about this, Sergeant.

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,451
You're not here to secure the trigger.
You're stealing it.

12
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,245
You want to read your confession
before you sign it?

13
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,790
- You did this.
- No one will ever believe your story.

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,959
We call ourselves Helix.
We're calling the data cache "Pandora."

15
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,246
With it, you can spark revolutions.

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,586
So, you're not just
giving me the file for John?

17
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,292
I've got all we need to exonerate John.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,423
- Well, how'd you do that?
- Long story.

19
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,464
Pleased to meet you.

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,810
I know exactly how this brotherhood works,
and right now, it works for me.

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:57,434
Shipwrecked on Lian Yu, fled to Hong Kong,
and now, you're mixed up with the Bratva.

22
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,191
The man who survived all this
is destined for so much more.

23
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,730
You need to give the monster an identity.

24
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,862
<i>It's only when the monster
becomes someone else,</i>

25
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,365
<i>something else,
that you're free to be Oliver Queen.</i>

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,912
I don't know if I'm ready.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,907
I will help you become ready.

28
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,511
What are we doing here?
These are low-level drug dealers.

29
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,426
They're target practice.

30
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,436
Stop!

31
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,084
You're beginning to understand now.

32
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,543
Understand what?

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,540
That the man who embraces the dark
is never without sight.

34
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,129
Okay,
so is this the Orchid Bay facility

35
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,422
or the Downtown rebuild?

36
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,549
How long until the announcement?

37
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,011
Don't you have a chief of staff
who usually handles this stuff?

38
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,016
- Excuse us, please.
- Okay.

39
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,724
Thea is looking into a few
joint initiatives that I proposed

40
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,399
while in Hub City last week.

41
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,737
Oh, that's really too bad. I've come to
look forward to her many looks of death.

42
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,147
Thea likes you, she's just...

43
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,449
It's okay, Oliver.
She's not the Queen I'm seeing.

44
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,410
That's sort of an old-fashioned way
to say it, don't you think?

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,453
Well, I'm not really sure
how else to put it

46
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,330
given that we haven't progressed.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,412
A funny way of saying
we haven't slept together.

48
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,917
Hi.

49
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,961
Hi, Quentin,
I wasn't expecting to see you today.

50
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,255
Well, you know,
that's the thing about rehab.

51
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,344
<i>It's a long process, and then it ain't.</i>

52
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,263
And by the looks of that assistant
out there, you need me back bad.

53
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,262
- How about I give you guys a moment?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,936
It's all right, Ms. Williams. I wasn't
planning on keeping my problems a secret.

55
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,274
In fact, I wanted to talk with you
about them. You know, on camera.

56
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,102
- I'll have my people set up an interview.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,899
I believe you are running late
for a press conference, Mr. Mayor.

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,870
- Oh, you live a complicated life.
- How are you?

59
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,956
You know, I'm better
than I've been in a long while, thanks.

60
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,000
That's fantastic to hear, but...
Look, maybe we shouldn't...

61
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,295
What, push my luck
by sitting down with your new girlfriend?

62
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,297
Well, no, just wait a little bit,
let Thea come back and prep you, and...

63
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,005
Oliver, if I were any more dry,
I'd be dust, okay?

64
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,463
I'm ready to move forward.
And this is how.

65
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,217
Now, didn't Ms. Williams say you were late
for a press conference?

66
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,426
Yep.

67
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,853
I like to thank District Attorney Chase

68
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,937
who stepped out of his lane
to represent my friend John Diggle

69
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,984
<i>to make sure that justice was done.</i>

70
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,405
Mr. Chase's efforts further exemplify
Star City takes care of their own.

71
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,533
Thank you, everybody, that'll be all.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,486
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,654
For getting me out.

74
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,662
Thank whoever leaked the NSA's case
against Walker. My job was easy.

75
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,705
Congratulations, Mr. Diggle.

76
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,624
L was wondering if the DA
might have a second to chat?

77
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,001
Save your energy, Ms. Williams,

78
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,545
I know you're doing a story
on the death of Detective Malone.

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,842
I have no comment for you.

80
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,886
And yet everyone I spoke to
said you're the man to speak to.

81
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,049
It's a little odd for a DA
to be so involved in a police matter.

82
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,887
<i>The victim
was a member of the ACU.</i>

83
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,687
That office is monitored by City Hall,
not by the SCPD.

84
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,727
- Oh, my God.
- Not what you wanted to hear?

85
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,351
Military police just took General Walker
into custody.

86
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,445
Walker and his men
just shot their way off of Fort Zerillo.

87
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,232
Thirty dead, and he and his men
are in the wind.

88
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,117
And the nuke trigger he stole
in Chechnya is still missing.

89
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,212
What can you tell us?

90
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,213
Lots. But first, welcome back.

91
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,337
- Hugs, kisses, warm feelings.
- Likewise.

92
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,545
I just got word from Lyla that A.R.G.U.S.
discovered a batch of encrypted emails

93
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,509
between Walker
and a group of Markovian separatists.

94
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,636
He's looking to sell the nuke.
We can't let that happen.

95
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,935
We have the US military and A.R.G.U.S.
hunting Walker.

96
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,479
They can't go where it's going.
The sale's in Russia.

97
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,264
This one's personal.

98
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,898
I gotta take that murderous son of a bitch
off the grid right now, whatever it takes.

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,443
City Hall gives me access
to a private plane.

100
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,819
- I'm coming, too.
- Felicity...

101
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,320
This is personal for me as well.

102
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,244
I promised I'd never let
another Havenrock happen again

103
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,072
as long as it was in my power,
and I believe that this qualifies.

104
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,250
Walker will have his whole unit with him,
maybe even some Markovians.

105
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,660
We need the whole team for this.

106
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,460
Agreed, but Quentin just got out of rehab,
and with Thea out of town I...

107
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,586
I need someone to keep an eye on him.

108
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,380
Who'd you have in mind?

109
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,643
Better be the report
on the Washington district water projects.

110
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,231
Not exactly, hoss.

111
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,775
- What are you... What?
- Why aren't you in your office?

112
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,442
Well, I came in here to work 'cause
everyone's been dropping by my office

113
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,106
asking how I am,
and I don't need the attention.

114
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,775
And by the way, I just got off the phone
with Oliver

115
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,951
who says he's on the way to Russia.
So what are you doing here?

116
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,621
Oliver said I'm supposed to help you prep
for your interview with Susan Williams,

117
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,875
and it was safer for me to be here
than over there

118
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,622
starting an "international incident."

119
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,837
Also, you need talk to your receptionist.

120
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,790
She didn't believe I was here for you,
I had to sneak past her just to get in.

121
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,130
I wonder how
she could've made that mistake.

122
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,471
Listen, why don't you just do us
both a favor, all right?

123
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,424
Just go home, polish your hockey mask
or something,

124
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,431
and I'll just tell Oliver you were here
the whole time. That's cool, right?

125
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:30,353
Sure. Except you're fresh out of rehab,
not a politician, about to face the media.

126
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,771
- So, what's it hurt to have a little help?
- Oh, just my waking sanity.

127
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,197
All right, well, pull up a chair.

128
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,281
- Coffee?
- Sure.

129
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,712
Okay, this whole flying private thing
is something I could really get used to.

130
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,005
Being Mayor has its perks.

131
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,503
You're lucky that Star City's
"sister city" is in Russia.

132
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,176
As of 12 hours ago, at least.

133
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,377
You ready for this?

134
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,629
When I signed on, I didn't think

135
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,007
I'd be stopping a nuclear arms sale
in a foreign country.

136
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,351
Yeah, when I signed on,
I didn't think I'd be dealing with aliens.

137
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,768
- Aliens?
- Yeah.

138
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,346
John said you had friends in Russia.

139
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,306
One friend.
Reached out, didn't hear back...

140
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,687
- Oliver Queen!
- Anatoly!

141
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,864
You never should have come back to Russia.

142
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,491
- Anatoly?
- Alexi Leonov. You remember him, yes?

143
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,872
- He was one of your brothers.
- I can explain.

144
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,539
You asked favor of him.

145
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,881
He asked favor in return,
and you pulled gun on him instead?

146
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,093
You know why I can't be some Bratva thug.

147
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,467
You made promise. You swore oath.

148
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,558
And now one of your brothers is dead.

149
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,015
So why should I welcome you as brother?

150
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,733
Go home, Oliver.
There's nothing for you here.

151
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,493
Ugh. Feel like somebody died
of tuberculosis in here.

152
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,832
What's the Russian word for creepy?

153
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,284
<i>Zhutko.</i>

154
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,418
I was studying on the plane.
Where did you find this place?

155
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,085
Lyla.

156
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,754
This used to be an A.R.G.U.S. safe house,

157
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,379
but as you can tell
from Amero-Russian relations,

158
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,463
- it hasn't been used much lately.
- Yeah, no kidding.

159
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,887
Right.
And why aren't we working with A.R.G.U.S.?

160
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,934
I assume preventing black market
nuclear deals

161
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,393
would be pretty high on their to-do list.

162
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,641
John's right about Russia.

163
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,060
A.R.G.U.S. can't operate here
without causing a diplomatic crisis.

164
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,935
Oh, yes, speaking of diplomatic crises,
why did your friend punch you?

165
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,943
Three years ago, I used a Bratva contact
when I was trying to track Slade Wilson.

166
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,743
He asked me for something in exchange,
I refused. Slade killed him.

167
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,910
How long do you think
until we're up and running?

168
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,957
I'm not sure. I'm pretty much
starting from scratch here,

169
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,207
and I have to hack the Russian server to
see if we can find any chatter on Walker,

170
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,751
and that might take no time,
or it might take, like, a lot of time.

171
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,208
What about your Bratva friend
with the good right hook?

172
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,459
You could try making nice.

173
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,717
It's not that simple.

174
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,089
Yeah, well, simple or not, Oliver,
we have to use every asset we've got.

175
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,108
I made a mistake with Leonov.

176
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,028
It was a challenging time.

177
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,325
But you still owe me for Gregor.

178
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,802
Lucky for you, I never liked Leonov. Sit.

179
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,883
John Diggle, it's good to see you.
Now you my favorite American.

180
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,342
Thanks.

181
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,099
So, what brings you to Russia?

182
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,643
We're looking for a US general
that has gone rogue.

183
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,477
We have reason to believe he's trying
to sell a nuke to Markovian terrorists.

184
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,936
What concern is that of yours?

185
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,904
Are you gonna help me
find this man or not?

186
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,488
After business with Leonov,

187
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,364
just me sitting with you
squares us with Gregor, yes?

188
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,916
Fine.

189
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,534
Then, we are even.

190
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,628
And back to how things work in Bratva.

191
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,087
I help you, you help me.

192
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,550
An arrangement you refused with Leonov,
if I'm not mistaken.

193
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:30,764
An arrangement I'm going to refuse again.
That part of my life is over.

194
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,887
Well, then I cannot help you.

195
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,061
<i>But I can offer you some free advice.</i>

196
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,060
Act quickly, Oliver.

197
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,768
The Markovians do not,
as you Americans say,

198
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,401
"Sit on their hands."

199
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,243
You did well.

200
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,079
You've proven to be a most adept student.

201
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,450
I know a few teachers
who would disagree with that assessment.

202
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,588
Hideo Yamane.
His name is in my father's notebook.

203
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,124
<i>And for good reason.</i>

204
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,417
Mr. Yamane's criminal enterprise
is responsible

205
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,174
for much of the designer drug trade
in Starling City.

206
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,843
<i>I think you'll recognize
his chief product?</i>

207
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,191
My sister was using this,
so I killed her dealer.

208
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,314
But I didn't consider the supply.
I left her, I left the city vulnerable.

209
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:33,364
This is why I found you, Oliver.
So you can correct your mistakes.

210
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,658
Now, Mr. Yamane is in town tonight
meeting with his Russian contacts.

211
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,835
He's a careful man,
he'll be heavily guarded.

212
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,248
- Am I ready?
- That's what we find out tonight.

213
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,688
Sorry. I don't really have much control
beyond "on" and "off."

214
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,900
Yeah, probably because you just produced
the sound of 1,000 Beyoncés?

215
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,985
I mean, polyphonics doesn't even begin
to explain what you're doing.

216
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,856
Can you guys please keep it down?

217
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,611
Okay, Walker has gone completely dark.

218
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,409
There is no way of pinpointing his IP
or his GPS from his phone,

219
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,620
which is probably just a burner anyway.

220
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,453
- That's good.
- How is that good?

221
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,996
Military men
tend to be creatures of habit.

222
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,292
If Walker's using a burner, odds are
it's the same model he used in the States.

223
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,464
And the only one
making calls to the Markovians.

224
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,684
Walker's flip phone of choice
is an old model.

225
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,979
The only network here
that supports it is DetraLink DST.

226
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,180
<i>Can you hack it?</i>

227
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,232
I mean, I could,
but it would take a lot of time.

228
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,934
I think I know someone
that could get us a shortcut.

229
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,686
You have contacts in Russia, too?

230
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,107
Well, kind of.
He might need a little bit of convincing.

231
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,741
Think you two could look like Bratva?

232
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,624
Sorry. I mean <i>prosti.</i>

233
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,386
- I can't see a thing in these.
- Tough guys don't say sorry, Curtis.

234
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,463
Right. No <i>prosti.</i>

235
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,049
Guys, focus.

236
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,051
Why isn't Dinah here with us?

237
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,470
Look, I'm secure enough in my manhood

238
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,439
to admit that she is way more intimidating
than either one of us.

239
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,067
Yes, and a total unknown quantity.

240
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,817
Look tough.

241
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:48,294
Maxim Ostrovsky. You speak English.
I suggest you start using it.

242
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,831
Who are you? What do you want?

243
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,916
To talk in private.

244
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,962
Don't make me ask you again.

245
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,477
Who are you?

246
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,400
Someone who needs access
to your system's credentials.

247
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,103
You work for DetraLink.

248
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,114
Not for long, I won't,
if I gave you my sign-in materials.

249
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,611
Funny, you didn't seem worried
about losing your job

250
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,448
when you ignored company policy to notify
the Kremlin about certain suspicious

251
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,325
and terrorist-like activity
on your network last year.

252
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,952
How do you know about that?

253
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,921
Better question is, who would I tell?

254
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,673
Because I am sure that the Kremlin
would love to hear about this.

255
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,302
You can't.

256
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,714
My family, they'll kill them.

257
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,058
Yes.

258
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,641
So I suggest it's in your best interest
to give me exactly what I want.

259
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,240
Time to go.

260
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,575
<i>Prosti.</i>

261
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,779
That guy was seriously shaken.
What'd you say?

262
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,988
What he needed to hear.

263
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,199
I've got what we need
to get a location on Walker.

264
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,552
Recon's in position.
I count 10 civilians in the church.

265
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,599
No sign of Walker or his men.

266
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,232
Backstop's also in position.
No activity here.

267
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,694
Are we sure
this is the spot, Overwatch?

268
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,440
Walker's phone just went active
from that address.

269
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,783
There.

270
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,703
John, there are civilians here.

271
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,406
I don't care, Oliver,
this may be our only shot.

272
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,120
We're moving on the target.
Everyone, stay sharp.

273
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,215
Proximity alarm!

274
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,765
Walker knew we were coming.

275
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,718
Diggle, get down!

276
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,608
- Are you guys hearing that?
- I'm guessing those aren't fireworks.

277
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,359
Recon, get those civilians clear.
Backstop...

278
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,861
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

279
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,239
<i>I don't know
who you gentlemen are,</i>

280
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,454
but I wanna thank you for
being so damn eager to find me.

281
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,934
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, we're good.

282
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,143
We lost Walker.

283
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,229
- Overwatch, do you have eyes on?
<i>- Negative.</i>

284
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,481
- All right, meet us out back.
- We've gotta find Walker.

285
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,947
We have his man.
He'll take us right to him. Come on.

286
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,584
What the hell is this?
There's no way you're A.R.G.U.S. or D.O.D.

287
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,880
Shut up.

288
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,420
Do whatever you want,
I'm not telling you anything.

289
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,129
There are thousands,
maybe millions, of lives at stake.

290
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,345
You don't want those deaths
on your conscience.

291
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,515
My conscience? You gotta be kidding.
What's that?

292
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,228
- This is your conscience.
- Stop!

293
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,226
Nothing stops.
Nothing stops until you tell me

294
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,729
when and where the buy is happening.

295
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:47,488
Now you have five minutes to decide
what you want your face to look like.

296
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,832
Oliver, you're just gonna leave him
in there?

297
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,076
Just give it time.

298
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,538
Oliver, we don't have time!
We have to get Walker now, right now!

299
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,672
Let me in there, and I'll give him
all the persuasion he needs.

300
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,175
He's gonna crack.
If you push him too hard right now,

301
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,798
he'll tell you whatever you wanna hear
to get the pain to stop.

302
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,760
We have to be smart, John, you know that.

303
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,229
As much as I enjoy my visits
to Mother Russia,

304
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,866
have you ever considered
relocating to Starling City?

305
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:41,546
What do you want? Money? Drugs?
I'll give you anything.

306
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,125
There's nothing you have that I want.

307
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,376
Why, why are you doing this?

308
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,305
Because you have failed Starling City.

309
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,182
All right, I got transcripts
of past interviews

310
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,189
Williams has done with alkies and addicts,
no offense.

311
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,562
ls you being here
really necessary?

312
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,069
Oliver wanted me to help you
prep for the interview.

313
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,196
So how about some practice questions?

314
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,444
All right, so you just got out of rehab.

315
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,906
What makes you think you're still fit
to serve as deputy mayor?

316
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,582
Well, that's a
very excellent question, Susan.

317
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,036
- Ms. Williams.
- "Ms. Williams..."

318
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,418
Well, I think
it's my dedication to this city.

319
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,588
- I have lived here my whole life...
- So have lots of people.

320
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,094
And I'm pretty sure not all of them
are recovering alcoholics.

321
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,508
I think it's been
my ability to persevere...

322
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,597
What are you persevering through?
Could you be more specific?

323
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,100
Well, I'm trying to. Would you let me
get a word in edgewise, please?

324
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,348
You think Susan Williams is gonna go
any easier?

325
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,430
Now, when did the drinking begin?

326
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,434
Was it before or after
the death of your daughter, Laurel?

327
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,728
What'd you just say?

328
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,610
Do you hold yourself
accountable for her death?

329
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,444
Or for working with Damien Darhk?

330
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,405
You shut your damn mouth
about my daughter!

331
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,903
Dude, chill! I'm just trying to help.

332
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,455
You're trying to help? Great.

333
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,785
I'm gonna leave here and when I get back,
you don't be here.

334
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,090
It's just me.

335
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,310
You know you have
a workstation inside, right?

336
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,976
Yeah, I wasn't having any luck
locating Walker,

337
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,188
so I decided I'd work on my frustration
in private.

338
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,853
What?

339
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,273
The guy back in the teahouse,

340
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,693
didn't look like someone
who owed you a favor.

341
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:39,998
He was terrified.
Felicity, what's really going on?

342
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,622
The NSA file that exonerated John.

343
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,170
It was part of a cache of information
given to me by a hacker group,

344
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:55,722
and that cache includes intel that I used
to pressure the DetraLink exec.

345
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,719
You mean you blackmailed him.

346
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
Well...

347
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:04,598
For this data cache to have exactly
what you needed for this particular guy,

348
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,104
it has to be huge.

349
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,985
I think the term is "beyond massive."

350
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,190
What?

351
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,109
One of the last things my dad said to me

352
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,036
when he gave me the rags,

353
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:24,701
was that they hold a power most
people could never even imagine.

354
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:30,040
And that I needed
to respect and guard that power,

355
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,958
not abuse it.

356
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,425
The people in this data cache,
they're not good people.

357
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,724
I'm starting to believe that my purpose
on this Earth is to stop people like them,

358
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,102
like Walker, no matter what the cost.

359
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,023
And sometimes
you gotta fight fire with fire.

360
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,937
I'm not worried about them,
I'm worried about you.

361
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,782
I thought you were
working on locating Walker.

362
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,988
Yeah.

363
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,032
Is everything okay?

364
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,326
This might be none of my business but
I think she crossed a line to find Walker.

365
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,620
- Rory.
- What? What line?

366
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,043
Stay here.

367
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,419
Where's the buy happening?

368
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,180
- Where's the buy happening?
- Hey, hey! John! That is enough!

369
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,342
That's enough!
I thought we were doing this my way.

370
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,980
Your way wasn't fast enough, Oliver.
I'm not letting Walker get away!

371
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,604
- Neither am l.
- What's happening?

372
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,611
- What happened?
- John got a little carried away.

373
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,939
Did he say anything?

374
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,900
No.

375
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,447
You get yourself cleaned up. I'll be back.

376
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,241
- Where you going?
- I'm going to handle this.

377
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,085
- What do you need me to do?
- That did not take long.

378
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,094
Anatoly, what do you want?

379
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,434
To our imperfect union. <i>Vashe zdorovie.</i>

380
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,393
<i>Vashe zdorovie.</i>

381
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,273
Thanks.

382
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,408
For coming as backup,
or for not telling anyone?

383
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,614
Both.

384
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,935
This isn't the first time
you've done something like this.

385
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,771
ls it?

386
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,571
- I don't mean as the Green Arrow...
- You mean as a thug, right?

387
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,024
No.

388
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,904
It's a part of my life that
I thought that I had moved past, but...

389
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,530
Here we are.

390
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,578
Right.

391
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,578
You know, the other guys said
when you get in one of your moods,

392
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,874
I should just let you be,
but, to be honest, brooding

393
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,251
really kinda gets on my nerves.

394
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,553
They told you about me.
They tell you about Prometheus?

395
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,964
Yeah, they did.

396
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,598
What... Why? Is this mood

397
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,885
because you got pulled back
into some Bratva drama?

398
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,052
No, it...

399
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,685
That I'm trying to move forward...

400
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,900
But I'm back here, I'm in Russia,
in the Bratva.

401
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,191
And it just proves to me
I can't seem to do that.

402
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,404
Prometheus got in your head.

403
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,323
What was it, some crap about
infecting the people closest to you?

404
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,834
Yeah, and tonight
I watched John torture a man.

405
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,918
And there is something
going on with Felicity. There's...

406
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,333
You affect the
people in your life, Oliver,

407
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,798
that's hardly a revelatory observation.

408
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,928
Yeah, in fact, I...
I think it's, uh... It's called living.

409
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,427
Prometheus has you so
fixated on what's wrong with you,

410
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,512
you've completely
stopped seeing what's right.

411
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,270
You know, John and Felicity,
they'll listen to you

412
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,692
because you have
more to offer than just this.

413
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,822
Your past is a part of you.

414
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,113
There is nothing you can do about that,
you can't change it.

415
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,411
Doesn't mean it has to be your anchor.

416
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,543
<i>The other names in that book
are waiting for you, Oliver.</i>

417
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,217
- They're waiting for you at home.
- I know.

418
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,423
Leaving the Bratva
is not going to be easy.

419
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,301
I swore an oath of allegiance.

420
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,887
Your father asked you to
take a different vow, did he not?

421
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,974
You told me he wanted you
to right his wrongs.

422
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,017
<i>You cannot do that from here.</i>

423
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,237
Can I come in,
or is it still "no dogs allowed?"

424
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,747
You really got
a wise-ass mouth on you, don't you?

425
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,830
I'm not sure, but did you just say
my mouth looks like ass?

426
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,287
Look, I just came in here to tell you that

427
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,171
Susan Williams'
producer called to confirm that

428
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,378
10:00 a.m. tomorrow
still works for the interview.

429
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,883
When did you become my assistant?

430
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,345
When I answered the phone, I guess.

431
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,182
It was out of line
bringing up my daughter.

432
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,844
You gonna tell that to Susan Williams
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow?

433
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,763
Look, man,
you expecting me to give you an apology,

434
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,898
- you don't know me that well.
- I don't know you at all.

435
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,528
But my sponsor says that
I'm the one that owes you the apology.

436
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,688
- It's cool, hoss.
- No, it's not cool.

437
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,701
My daughter, Laurel, is gone.

438
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,620
And I gotta figure out a way to live with
that which doesn't involve booze

439
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,790
or snapping at guys
that are just trying to help.

440
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,791
You know, 10:00 a.m.
will be here before you know it.

441
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,252
How about another dry run?

442
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,968
- Take a seat.
- Atta boy.

443
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,223
Quit calling me "hoss."

444
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,098
All right. You ready?

445
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,227
- Where are your questions?
- I got 'em right here.

446
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,352
Where were you?
Did you take Dinah somewhere?

447
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,103
Yes, but not like that.

448
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,489
Okay, what happens in Russia,
stays in Russia, remember?

449
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,070
- Where's Walker's man?
- Curtis and Rory are keeping eyes on him.

450
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,780
I think she means protecting him from me.

451
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,486
Oliver, I still think it's a mistake

452
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,576
not pushing the scumbag
for the location of the sale.

453
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,490
We don't have to,
we're gonna have it within the hour.

454
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,910
- What? How?
- Bratva.

455
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,625
Hey, Anatoly wasn't playing ball
unless you did the Bratva's dirty work...

456
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,502
Which is where you took Dinah.

457
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,917
Oliver, I thought you didn't
want anything to do with the Bratva.

458
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,132
I don't, but if it's a choice between
me crossing a line

459
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,889
and the two of you crossing one,
that is a very easy choice.

460
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,934
- What did you do?
- Doesn't matter.

461
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,479
Here's what does. I am who I am.

462
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,773
Now, I'm trying to work past that.

463
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,150
Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but I cannot,

464
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,734
I will not have the two of you
make the same mistakes.

465
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,234
Oliver, you're the one that taught us

466
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,446
that sometimes you have to
get in the muck to make things right.

467
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,783
Well, then Prometheus wins
because he'll be right.

468
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,575
I need the two of you to prove to him,
and quite frankly,

469
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,709
to prove to me that he's not.

470
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,212
I need the two of you
to be better than me.

471
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,422
Because you are.
That's why we work together.

472
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,847
Uh, there is a whole mess
of angry Russian dudes outside.

473
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,978
I have location for Walker,
and men to help in fight.

474
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,403
<i>But we have to leave now.</i>

475
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,525
Your strange friend's pronunciation
is horrible.

476
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,238
Yeah, I'll tutor him later.

477
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,958
<i>He'!-</i>

478
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,255
Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.

479
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,050
You sure you don't wanna
toast the transaction?

480
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,678
Ah, I'd love to,
but I got a plane to catch.

481
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,805
And there's someone I'm trying to avoid.

482
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,730
- American government?
- I wish it were just them.

483
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,069
Green Arrow, tango headed your way.
I love saying the word "tango."

484
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,282
So do I.

485
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,229
Okay, in the future,
you might not wanna do that

486
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,765
with a van carrying a nuclear bomb!

487
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,357
That was a neat trick.
Now what's your plan?

488
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,245
Stay down, you son of a bitch.

489
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,414
Who the hell are you?

490
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,089
You didn't expect to
see me here, did you, General?

491
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,094
And no one's gonna believe that I was.

492
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,223
But everyone's gonna know that you tried
to sell a nuclear bomb to terrorists.

493
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,511
You're assuming I actually meant to
sell a bomb to the Markovians, John.

494
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,809
Bomb's not here.

495
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,152
Walker's headed for the hangar.
Odds are that's where the nuke is.

496
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,362
Felicity!

497
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,534
Why the ruse?

498
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,661
Why sell a nuclear weapon once

499
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,165
when I can steal it back and
sell it to another rebel sucker?

500
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,082
Rory?

501
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,796
Curtis told me you needed some help.

502
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,332
He was probably worried
I'd do something stupid.

503
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,297
Those were his exact words, actually.

504
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,460
Okay, you need to get out of here.

505
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,879
I think he said those would be
your exact words.

506
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,046
The bomb is in countdown mode.

507
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,214
<i>- What?
- It's wired with a failsafe.</i>

508
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,928
We must have triggered it
when we entered the hangar.

509
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,764
- Can you disarm it?
- If I can't,

510
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,303
the yield of this thing
will spread over 50 miles.

511
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,728
Do it.

512
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,935
You know you want to.

513
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,528
Come on, John, you have to.

514
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,778
I got a lot of friends, John.

515
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,490
Lots of resources
with itchy trigger fingers.

516
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:48,324
And you, well, you got a wife and kid.

517
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,161
Terrific, Overwatch,
any luck locating the nuke?

518
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,171
<i>Overwatch is off comms
and in the hangar.</i>

519
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,833
I think she's trying to
disable the nuke herself.

520
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,422
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no, no. No!

521
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,174
- What happened?
- Trapdoor code,

522
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,634
<i>- I walked right into it.
- RORY". What does that mean?</i>

523
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:07,051
Any attempt to disarm the nuke will
exponentially pace up the countdown clock.

524
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,639
Wait, what are you doing?

525
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,304
Hoping like hell I can
figure out how to fly a plane.

526
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,562
- What?
- I can't disarm the nuke,

527
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,723
but hopefully I can get it
to a less populated area.

528
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,767
Less populated? What, like Havenrock?

529
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,311
This isn't the time to revisit that.

530
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,275
No. No, no, this is exactly the time.

531
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,656
The rags survived Havenrock,
they can survive this, too.

532
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,034
I can use them to
contain the blast and the radiation!

533
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,537
- No, you don't know that!
- Well, I don't need to know, I have faith.

534
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,198
Okay, but it should be me. Not you.

535
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,366
I don't have time
to take these rags off, so...

536
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,544
Go! Just in case this, you know,
doesn't work.

537
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,500
Felicity, go!

538
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,917
Do it. Go on.

539
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:48,885
No, General. No, you're gonna stand trial.

540
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,220
I'm gonna see that justice is done.

541
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,609
What's happening?

542
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,326
- Rory!
- Oh, my God!

543
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,210
- Well, he always gets the credit.
- Are you okay?

544
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,047
This means I get a promotion, right?

545
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,521
To Rory and his
amazing nuke-stopping rags,

546
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,681
which hopefully doesn't
give us all radiation poisoning.

547
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,155
- Wimps.
- Yeah, can't you hold your vodka?

548
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,533
Now you my favorite American.

549
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,656
Did you hear from Lyla?

550
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,700
Walker's being escorted
under military guard as we speak.

551
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,864
Congratulations.

552
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,035
You know, well, Walker threatened
JJ and Lyla, just like Andy did.

553
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,755
First, I wondered why
I didn't shoot him like I did Andy,

554
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,966
then I remembered
what you said to me and Felicity.

555
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,468
Well, I'm just glad that it took.

556
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,504
But, you know, Oliver, you were wrong.

557
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,264
Me and Felicity, we're no better than you.

558
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:14,144
You, me, Felicity,
we make each other better.

559
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,938
- I'll drink to that.
- You're my brother, Oliver.

560
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:25,113
Oliver. It's good,
good being friends again.

561
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,699
I forgot how strong this is over here.

562
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,527
I make sure I bring some
when I come to Star City.

563
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,199
Yeah.

564
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,118
Ah, I hear you're mayor now.
Big promotion.

565
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,669
Now you Pakhan,
now you tell everyone what to do.

566
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,796
That's not how things work in America,
Anatoly.

567
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,798
Yeah, that's the way things work
everywhere.

568
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,593
I was hoping maybe you could repay me.

569
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,924
- I thought we were even.
- I thought you return to Bratva.

570
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,885
That was temporary.

571
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,684
That is thing about oaths, Oliver.

572
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,185
They are never temporary,
they are for life.

573
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,325
I need to speak with Anatoly.

574
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,666
Where have you been?

575
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,041
I need to speak with Anatoly.

576
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,497
Where is he?

577
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,352
Anatoly?

578
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,440
Oliver? Is that you?

579
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,895
Yeah.

580
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,444
What happened?

581
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,324
Gregor.

582
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,741
I questioned his deal with Kovar.

583
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,660
He did this to me.

584
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,583
You were right about him.

585
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,750
His loyalty lies with Kovar.

586
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,927
But Gregor is Pakhan.
There is nothing we can do.

587
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,924
That's not true.

588
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,886
We can kill him.

589
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,766
You are my brother, Oliver.

590
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,858
Oleg said that you
needed to tell me something.

591
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,527
That can wait.

592
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,799
You know,
if visiting Star City's "sister city"

593
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,459
is what it took to get you to bed,

594
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,754
I would've bought you
a ticket to Russia months ago.

595
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,967
A friend of mine told me that

596
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,812
my past doesn't have to be my anchor.

597
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,981
And I think my past is what was

598
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,654
stopping me from
moving things forward with you.

599
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,329
Looking at all this, I can understand why.

600
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,618
What exactly happened
to you on that island, anyway?

601
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,333
Things that I'm not ready to talk about.

602
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,459
Not even this crazy tattoo?

603
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,425
I mean, how do you even get
something like this on a deserted island...

604
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,836
Hey, hey.

605
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,881
You're not ready to talk about it.

606
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,886
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right. Okay.

607
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,930
Do you mean, like, not now or not ever?

608
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,060
Not now.

609
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,355
Maybe someday?

610
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,358
Yeah.

611
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,355
I can wait for someday.

612
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,218
Hey, what'd that bag ever do to you, huh?

613
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,353
<i>- You got</i> a <i>minute?
- Sure.</i>

614
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,398
How'd the interview go with
Oliver's girlfriend?

615
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,599
Cakewalk.

616
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,645
In fact, I asked her if she
went easy on me and she said she did.

617
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,110
'Cause of something you said to her.

618
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,743
L didn't say much.

619
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,994
L just told her a story about you and me.

620
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,080
- You and me?
- I figured you didn't remember.

621
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,997
When I was a kid,
you were a beat cop on my block.

622
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,252
You caught me tagging a building,

623
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,881
but instead of hauling me in,
you crouched down,

624
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,508
looked me in the eye and told me...

625
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,603
I could be more than just
some rip-run thug.

626
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,443
It really set me on a better path.
You did, I mean.

627
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,105
I had no idea, Rene.

628
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,774
Anyway, I just wanted the reporter to know

629
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,738
just what kinda guy
she was sitting down with.

630
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,363
Didn't you still get dishonorably
discharged from the military, though?

631
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,040
Nobody's perfect.

632
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:47,977
<i>Hey.</i>

633
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,476
Hey. What're you doing here?

634
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,309
Well, I'm just making sure
you're not radioactive.

635
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,943
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I was...

636
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,447
I was gonna call.

637
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,532
Well, I was probably gonna
wimp out and text.

638
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,695
What's going on?

639
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,125
The blast did something to them.
They don't work anymore.

640
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,838
I don't have any control.
They don't offer any protection.

641
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,009
- Well, I'm sure it's just temporary.
- I'm not.

642
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,220
I have a bond with them, Felicity,
I can feel it.

643
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,598
And let's be honest,
without the rags, I'm a liability.

644
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,688
And one the team can't risk,
not with Prometheus out there.

645
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,941
Okay, well, that doesn't
mean you have to leave.

646
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,397
Don't worry. I'll be back.

647
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,104
You'll, uh...

648
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,195
You'll let the team know?

649
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:48,030
Yeah. I mean,
I'll probably just wimp out and text.

650
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,555
- Well?
- You were right.

651
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,481
All the guys in this photo are Bratva.
Means "brotherhood" in Russian.

652
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,644
<i>I</i> know.

653
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,781
Bratva get tattoos on their chests
when they make captain.

654
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,065
What about the other thing?

655
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,576
Nah, I couldn't find
anything else on Queen in Russia.

656
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,154
But I reviewed criminal activity

657
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,914
from the period he was there,
and I found something very interesting.

658
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,411
The Russians call him <i>Luchnik,</i>
the Archer.

659
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,420
Does he remind you of anyone you know?

660
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,877
The Green Arrow.

661
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,593
Now, what are the odds of Oliver Queen

662
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,300
and the Green Arrow
being in Russia at the same time?

663
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,890
Very good...

664
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,927
If Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.
