1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,753
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,069
<i>After 6 months in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,856
<i>I have been released from prison
and returned home</i>

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,758
<i>with only one goal...</i>

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,194
<i>to save my city,</i>

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,640
<i>but things have changed.</i>

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,439
<i>Instead of operating
outside the law,</i>

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,512
<i>I am now working
alongside the police.</i>

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,429
<i>I am no longer inmate 4587.</i>

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,920
<i>I am once more...</i>

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,157
<i>The Green Arrow.</i>

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,879
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,480
There's always gonna
be another Dante.

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,680
There's always gonna be a
logical reason to compromise,

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,274
but I'm not doing
that anymore.

16
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,114
- Walking way is not the answer.
- Well, I'm not walking away.

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,839
I'm gonna call
my own shots.

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,696
I went to go check
your midterm results online,

19
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,056
and I didn't come across any test results
because you didn't take the exams.

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,072
- Why?
- Because I got expelled.

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,834
So you found this place
by watching that documentary?

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,230
Vigilantes were
the death of Star City,

23
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,755
and they got exactly
what they deserved.

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,035
We now have
unfettered access

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,680
to the Archer Program's
entire security interface.

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,989
Let's find those bombs.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,758
- Heading home soon?
- Not quite yet.

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,920
I'll see you
in the morning.

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,559
What's it say?

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,314
Nothing.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,278
Just some punk kid
pulling a prank.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,071
You ever get in
trouble with your parents?

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,516
Uh, yeah.
All the time. Why?

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Because William doesn't
need pancakes.

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,755
William needs to tell us
why he got expelled

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,718
and why he's been
lying to us.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,553
- After pancakes or...
- no.

38
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,994
OK.

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,470
- Ready to talk?
- About what?

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,835
Why you got
expelled.

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,752
Come on, will.
You know you can talk

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,752
to us about
anything. Please.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,674
It's not a big deal.
I just got into a fight.

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,114
I thought you'd be
proud of me.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,032
I went for the nose
just like you told me.

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,720
When did you tell him
to go for the nose?

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,114
That was over
a year ago,

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,159
and it was a lesson in self-defense,
thank you.

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,000
Buddy, it's not like
you to get into a fight.

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,315
Why do you guys
even care?

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,736
Every time that we spoke,
you're telling me

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,816
how much you love
your school,

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,071
about your new friends
and your classes.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,554
What am I missing here?

55
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,216
Maybe you should have
asked how I felt for once,

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,311
but you don't ask other
people for their opinions.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,073
You decide everything
on your own

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,576
just like you decided
to go to prison

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,512
rather than take care
of your family!

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,434
I don't think
that's fair, but OK.

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,910
William, you got
expelled,

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
and, young man, you
need to understand

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,190
that in life you have to
accept responsibility

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,430
for your actions.

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,477
Yeah? I'm over this.

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,712
W-William. Hey.

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,474
William, we're not
done here.

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,674
That went well.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,671
Damn it! Still no luck
figuring out

70
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,120
where Felicity planted
those bombs.

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,351
Well, I'm pretty sure
hitting that thing harder's

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,238
not gonna make it
work better.

73
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,198
Makes me feel
better, though.

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,096
The Archer Program's
supposed to see everything,

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,112
but what good's that when
there's nothing to see?

76
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,559
About damn time.

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,597
Your algorithm
kind of sucks.

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,593
Ah. Nice to see you, too.
Give it to me.

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,439
Archer's not helping us,
and that means

80
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,910
Blackstar's our only lead
on finding those bombs.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,992
You guys have any luck
tracking her down?

82
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,056
Uh-uh. I spent the last few
days searching the entire city,

83
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,072
but she knows
how to be a ghost.

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,197
Pretty easy to do with
the way the city is now.

85
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,112
OK. My algorithm
isn't the problem.

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,590
The Archer Program was designed
to monitor The Glades,

87
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,000
but Star City is
10 times the size

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,912
with half the technological
infrastructure.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,480
So less eyes covering
a larger area.

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Even if that's
the case,

91
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,279
that bomb plan
was massive.

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,589
We should have
found something.

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,616
Well, not if the bombs haven't
been positioned yet.

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,996
I mean,
maybe Felicity stockpiled them

95
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,275
somewhere
off the grid,

96
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,976
somewhere no one would
ever think to look.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,798
I think
I might know a place.

98
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,840
This is definitely
off the grid.

99
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,517
God.
I used to think this place was so cool.

100
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,200
I can't believe
it's still standing.

101
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,670
I can't believe my dad
used to call this home.

102
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,071
Yeah. Well, no one's called
this home for quite some time.

103
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,560
Someone's been here.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,750
Unh!

105
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,274
Someone's
still here.

106
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,670
I told you this
wouldn't end well.

107
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,520
What's that, some
A.R.G.U.S. fan mail?

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,319
No, not exactly.

109
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh. This is some <i>I know what
you did last summer</i> creepiness.

110
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,914
- You want me to run a DNA trace?
- No. Already on top of that.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,799
Besides, that's not the reason
why I called you in here.

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,712
How's the search
for Dante coming?

113
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,110
Good. We were able to backtrace
the number Diaz called.

114
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,954
It belongs to Dante's contact in Egypt,
a guy by the name of Virgil.

115
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,032
If we're able to bring him in,
we'll have Dante.

116
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,557
Fantastic!
And we would have you to thank for it.

117
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,869
Excellent work,
Curtis.

118
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,236
Too bad I might not be
around for my victory lap.

119
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,519
What are we talking
about here?

120
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,512
There's no good way
to say this,

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,230
but I've been offered a job at the
kohler humanitarian institute in D.C.

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,896
I would be able to create
tech that would be able

123
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,912
to help people
all over the world.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,136
Curtis, I know you're not happy
with the ghost initiative,

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,896
but I was hoping that
we could get past that.

126
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,376
Besides, the work you're doing
right here at A.R.G.U.S.

127
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,312
is already helping people
all over the world.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,235
I know you
believe that, John.

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,039
I'm just not sure
that I do.

130
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,230
The key is to maintain
eye contact.

131
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,152
Your assailant's gonna
focus on your weakness.

132
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,038
In this case,
it's that injury.

133
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,600
So you draw them in,

134
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,071
and as soon as they're
close enough, strike.

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,313
Yeah! That's very good.
Eh, you're a natural.

136
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,834
Thanks for teaching me,
aunt Dinah.

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,560
It's so cool learning how to
kick ass from the Black Canary.

138
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,075
Keep kicking the crap
out of that shield,

139
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,710
and captain Drake's gonna
have to deputize you, too.

140
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,156
How about you keep practicing
your kicks in your room?

141
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,118
- OK.
- Good job.

142
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,395
Nice work, Zoe.

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,190
I saw the way
you looked

144
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,636
when Zoe mentioned
the Black Canary.

145
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,518
You still adjusting
to being outed?

146
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,536
Well, it was one thing when all
the people in our inner Circle

147
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,040
knew about my
secret identity,

148
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,430
but now
everybody knows,

149
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,035
the cops at SCPD,
everybody.

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,111
I don't know. Maybe
I'm just worried

151
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,550
people are gonna
treat me differently

152
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,994
now that
the secret's out.

153
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,176
Yeah. Well,
maybe it's a good idea that me and the team

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,954
are gonna be hanging out
at the SCPD for now

155
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,560
in case I got to
crack some heads.

156
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,790
Oh. Thanks.

157
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,759
Hey. Ever since you
became captain,

158
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,998
you've been busting your ass to
earn their trust and respect,

159
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,958
so you keep doing
what you're doing

160
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,016
and don't sweat the haters
because they're gonna hate

161
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,750
like... whoever
left me this.

162
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,950
- When did you get this?
- Last night.

163
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,793
Figured it was some
punk-ass pranking me

164
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,475
for working with you
and the SCPD.

165
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,756
- Oh, damn.
- What, did you get one, too?

166
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,594
And so did Laurel.
We've been trying to track down who did it.

167
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,416
We thought maybe it was about
a case we worked together,

168
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,736
but if you're
getting them, too...

169
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,956
who knows who his
next target is?

170
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,440
Ohh!

171
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,194
Get back!

172
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,318
What the hell?
I can't move.

173
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,960
Oh. Stop! Please
just stop.

174
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,918
I'll give you
anything you want.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,276
Why are you
doing this?

176
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,518
Wow! This is
a lot of blood.

177
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,752
I thought kullens was
in jail for helping Diaz.

178
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,656
Yeah.
Well, apparently, he had a very good lawyer

179
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,797
because he got out
a month ago.

180
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,832
Any chance this connects
with the two body drops

181
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,434
we were looking at
last week?

182
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,896
Kullens did have his throat slit,
same as the other two.

183
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,600
I mean, the only difference
is that kullens

184
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,679
was the only victim to leave
behind one of these notes.

185
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,194
Look familiar?

186
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,040
I spoke to the families
of the other victims,

187
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,355
and they did get
notes, as well.

188
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,312
- They just didn't turn them in.
- Right.

189
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,576
This is turning out to be one
hell of a first day on the job.

190
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,557
Yeah. Look at us,
working together again,

191
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,552
being targeted
by a homicidal maniac.

192
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,869
Feels like a Monday.

193
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
What about Laurel?

194
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,679
You said that she
got a note, too.

195
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,320
She did, but she's fine.
She's at a conference in D.C. all week.

196
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,598
OK. So wait.
You, me, Laurel, Rene all got notes.

197
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,536
- Curtis and Oliver didn't.
- Oh, don't worry about me.

198
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,517
I'm definitely not
feeling fomo over it.

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,114
Well, we already know
this killer's

200
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,376
not only targeting
people on the team.

201
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,754
Kullens was against
vigilantes,

202
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,536
and we didn't even know
the other two victims.

203
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
There has to be
a connection.

204
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,110
We just... Be patient,
and we'll find it.

205
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,429
Maybe this will help.

206
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,352
- Kullens' autopsy report.
- Thank you.

207
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,956
Tox screen is clear.
No defensive wounds.

208
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
So he didn't fight back.

209
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,554
This M.O. feels
very familiar.

210
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,632
When I was undercover
in Central City,

211
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,880
the guys in homicide were
chasing after a serial killer

212
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,553
with a very similar
pattern...

213
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,758
throat slash and victims
who didn't fight back.

214
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm gonna give
captain Singh a call.

215
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,433
Wakey, wakey, money bags.

216
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,396
Unh!

217
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,555
Touch me, I'll bite
your hand off.

218
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,797
Almost makes me forget
that you're nothing

219
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,633
but a pampered girl
from The Glades

220
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,837
playing vigilante
dress-up.

221
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,354
What do you want?

222
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,517
The access codes
to Archer.

223
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,273
Go to hell.

224
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,080
Well, let's try this
another way.

225
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,560
Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

226
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,313
The access codes now.

227
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,595
Keep your mouth
shut, William.

228
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,399
So that's your name.

229
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,839
All right, William.
What the hell are you even doing here?

230
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,276
Funny. I was just about
to ask you the same thing.

231
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,477
Ooh. Is that
a backbone I'm seeing?

232
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,995
Even if we give you the codes,
you're just gonna kill us

233
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,936
just like you killed Felicity and just like
you're gonna kill the rest of the city,

234
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,599
so what is the point
in talking?

235
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,230
Someone is trying to blow up the city,
but it's not me,

236
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,960
and I sure as hell
didn't kill Felicity.

237
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,793
Then who did?

238
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,589
I've been thinking
about what you said,

239
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,176
about wanting to do
something different.

240
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,560
OK. Suddenly, I'm getting nervous
about where this is going.

241
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,359
No need.

242
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,995
Just talked with Lyla,
and we both agree

243
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,518
that, Curtis, we cannot afford
to lose a talent like yours,

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,798
so A.R.G.U.S. wants
to make you

245
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,475
the head of its science
and technology division.

246
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,870
You want me in charge
of the entire division?

247
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,880
The entire division.
You'll be shaping the future

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,639
of A.R.G.U.S., Curtis,

249
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,189
and you can make all the
decisions just like you wanted.

250
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,320
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll do it, man.

251
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,676
Just stay here
in Star City.

252
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,234
You can keep working
with the team.

253
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,040
I think it's the best
of both worlds.

254
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,274
Think about it.

255
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,437
Captain Singh, thank you
for getting back to me.

256
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,399
I'd have done it sooner,
but some new metahuman freak

257
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,560
sent a bunch of Central
City's finest to the hospital

258
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,720
before the flash and his
team were able to stop them,

259
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,197
<i>not that there's anything
wrong with metahumans.</i>

260
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,919
No disrespect
intended, Dinah.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,037
Well, none taken. Heh.

262
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,856
And here I was just starting
to feel like I had a handle

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,155
on this whole captain thing.

264
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,039
Do you remember when
blockbuster and his gang

265
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,440
tried to expand
their operations

266
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,000
from bludhaven
to Central City?

267
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,675
And almost started a turf war with
all the major crime families?

268
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,075
- Yeah.
- But it didn't,

269
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,514
all because one
undercover cop

270
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,990
had the balls and the brains
to infiltrate their ranks

271
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,117
and prevent
a citywide bloodbath.

272
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,350
<i>If anyone knows
how to win</i>

273
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,000
<i>hearts and minds,
Dinah, it's you.</i>

274
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,072
You just have to
have faith in yourself.

275
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,074
I certainly do.

276
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,038
So about that case file.

277
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,675
Your father is gonna make
his famous chili tonight.

278
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,160
Does he really think making
dinner is gonna solve everything?

279
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,072
I mean, it's his chili
we're talking about.

280
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,516
I'm pretty sure it
could solve world peace.

281
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,951
- Let me see that.
- It's impossible.

282
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,976
Actually, solving
a Rubik's Cube is a lot

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,832
like running
an algorithm.

284
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,913
In fact, my favorite
pattern is a cube

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,354
within a cube.

286
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,355
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,036
<i>The Green Arrow has
entered through the front door.</i>

288
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,952
Heh heh heh.

289
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,296
- The Green Arrow?
- You know, I thought I'd give

290
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,551
the security system
a little personality.

291
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,199
Hey, buddy.

292
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
Help me unpack
these bags.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,070
I'm good.

294
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,315
I'm gonna give you two
a moment alone.

295
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,312
Give me those.
Thank you.

296
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,076
William,
I understand why you were mad at me before.

297
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,959
You have every right
to be mad at me, OK?

298
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,199
You're a tough kid.

299
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,236
And I forget sometimes
that you are just a kid...

300
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,195
That's lived in 4 different
cities over the past 2 years.

301
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,239
That's tough.
One of the many reasons

302
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,797
why Felicity and I think that
you should come back here

303
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,315
and live with us.

304
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,951
<i>Warning, warning.
Unidentified person at the front door.</i>

305
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,719
Did you...

306
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,953
Mr. and Mrs. Clayton?

307
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What are you doing here?

308
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,197
Our grandson called us.

309
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,917
OK. I apologize.
I understand and appreciate

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,198
why after everything
that's happened

311
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,192
you two might
be worried,

312
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,751
but we can assure you that...
that going forward

313
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,833
things will be better
and more stable, OK?

314
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,394
- They will be...
- Right.

315
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,040
Because we're taking
him with us.

316
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,239
We're filing a suit
for guardianship.

317
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,640
No. You can't do that.

318
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,154
William, we need to speak
with your grandparents alone.

319
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,873
Oliver, it's
an open-and-shut case.

320
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,599
You're a convicted felon.

321
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,797
You were absent
for most of his life,

322
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,440
and then once you
showed up... heh...

323
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,833
he's kidnapped,
he's sent into hiding from a mob boss.

324
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,956
I'm his father, frank.

325
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,554
By blood maybe,

326
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,520
but you are not fit
to be William's guardian,

327
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
either of you.

328
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,113
We should have done
this a long time ago.

329
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,112
Yes, dear.

330
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,395
It's what Samantha would
have wanted for him.

331
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,075
William is my son.
Felicity treats

332
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,799
and cares
for him like a son,

333
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,111
and nobody...

334
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,873
Is gonna take him
away from us.

335
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,633
No one.

336
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,480
Are you OK?

337
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,313
I hate tranqs.

338
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,669
Where are the others?

339
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,037
Hey, you!
Where are our friends?

340
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,911
They're
with Blackstar.

341
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,957
Hey. She's got
questions to ask.

342
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,474
What about us?

343
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,791
I already know everything
I need to know about you,

344
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,554
and you guys should have
stayed out of this.

345
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,793
Wait. I recognize you.

346
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,197
You know him?

347
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,751
And so do you.
You're Connor hawke,

348
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,634
John Diggle's son.

349
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
Thank you, Dinah.

350
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,635
Call me if you
need anything, OK?

351
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,120
All right.

352
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,559
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

353
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,917
Why? Sounds like you got
to go save the city again.

354
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,074
William, get over here
and sit down.

355
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,194
What?

356
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,400
Your grandparents are trying
to take you away from me.

357
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,234
There is no chance
that that's gonna happen,

358
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,678
but I cannot... I cannot
have you phoning for backup

359
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,274
every time that you're
mad at me.

360
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,896
It's the only thing
that got you to listen!

361
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,752
You think I'm
not listening?

362
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,594
I have heard and felt

363
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,878
every single terrible thing that you've
said to me since you've been back!

364
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,912
Come on. I'm... I'm
trying my best.

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,117
That's the problem because
whenever you're around,

366
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,754
things always
get worse!

367
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,513
You want to give me
a normal life?

368
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,434
Yes! That's all I've
ever tried to do!

369
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,751
That's why i...
that why I've asked you

370
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,136
to come back here and live
with Felicity and I.

371
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,790
That isn't a normal life!
I want to go live with my grandparents!

372
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,836
Eight murders over the
course of 2 months.

373
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,936
And this is definitely the
same guy we're dealing with?

374
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,680
Yeah. Analysis of the wound
confirms the same angle of entry

375
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,911
in all the murders here
and in Central City.

376
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,358
The question is why pack up
and bring the fun here?

377
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,960
Yeah. That really is the missing
piece of the puzzle, isn't it?

378
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,990
Doesn't seem to be

379
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,595
any obvious connection
between the victims.

380
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,478
Actually,
maybe there is.

381
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,473
They all had elevated levels
of magnesium in their blood.

382
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,313
But their tox screens
came back clear.

383
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,916
Well, that's because increased
magnesium alone isn't a red flag,

384
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,600
but if you combine that with
decreased levels of red blood cells,

385
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,036
then you have a drug
called mivacurium.

386
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,919
It's a neuromuscular
blocking agent.

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
Captain Singh said it looked like
the victims had been immobilized.

388
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,080
It's because they
had been drugged.

389
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,038
Mivacurium is
extremely rare.

390
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,635
In fact, there's only been one
shipment in the past month

391
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,916
to Star City to a condemned
house in The Glades

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,640
addressed to a John Doe.

393
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,236
- Hey, don't, Curtis.
- Why not?

394
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,471
What if someone spots
that thing flying around?

395
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,279
Might as well have
a freaking neon sign

396
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,353
that says, "hey, murderer.
We're here."

397
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,711
You were saying, Rene?

398
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,678
Curtis, Rene,
you take upstairs.

399
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,958
Me and Dinah will
secure down here.

400
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,239
Split up? What? Have you guys
never seen a horror movie before?

401
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,834
Wait, Rene!

402
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,590
Rene.

403
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,909
Don't sneak up
on me like that!

404
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,196
Sorry. What was that?

405
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,313
Our psycho was
at slabside?

406
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,790
Hyah!

407
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,792
Unh!

408
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,071
You should have
listened to me.

409
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,355
<i>- Dinah.
- Dinah, where are you?</i>

410
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,397
<i>Dinah, I need you to copy.
Can you hear me?</i>

411
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,472
<i>Dinah, where are you?</i>

412
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,756
- Oh!
- Oh, my god.

413
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,594
Dinah. Have to stop
the bleeding.

414
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,936
We have to call
an ambulance.

415
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,110
They won't get here
in time.

416
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,157
You're gonna
be fine. D!

417
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,435
It's too deep.

418
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,432
- There's nothing I can do.
- What?!

419
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,736
Maybe there's something
I can do.

420
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,056
I've been working
on a new prototype...

421
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,376
mid-Infrared lasers that might
be able to cauterize the wound.

422
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,437
- Might or will?
- I don't know,

423
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,336
but the only way to bond the
cut is by burning it first.

424
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,670
- I've never tested it, though!
- Do it! Do it!

425
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,592
OK.

426
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,195
- Tell me when.
- When.

427
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,194
OK. Done.

428
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,993
There's a pulse.

429
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,076
You did it.

430
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,799
Be strong, Dinah.

431
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,316
I take it by the way that
you're treating the chili

432
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
that your talk
didn't go so well.

433
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,056
He wants to go live
with his grandparents.

434
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,496
- And you think that's...
- I think it's ridiculous

435
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,080
because we're his family and
we are what's best for him!

436
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,096
Well, we've all grown
and changed a lot

437
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,032
since you got out
of slabside,

438
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,800
and I've been thinking
that maybe you and I

439
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,674
need to think more about
what William needs.

440
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,752
You need to tell me...

441
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,476
If you honestly believe that he
would be better off away from us.

442
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,075
I think that now
that you're working

443
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,039
with the SCPD
and Team Arrow again

444
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,990
that we don't exactly provide
a life of normalcy and...

445
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,760
I just want to be a better father
for him than my father was for me.

446
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,912
You already are by giving him
the life that he deserves...

447
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,838
Even if it breaks
our hearts.

448
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,950
If you didn't kill
Felicity, then who did?

449
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,477
No one. Felicity's
still alive.

450
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,196
How do you know that?

451
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,277
I just do.

452
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,750
It's why I need Archer...
to find Felicity.

453
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,479
Don't listen to her.
She's a liar.

454
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,472
She'll say
anything to...

455
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,914
you didn't need
to do that.

456
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,195
No, but I enjoyed it.

457
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,914
Now... how about
those codes?

458
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,640
Only after you tell me why
you're looking for Felicity.

459
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,280
Let's just say
we owe each other.

460
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,599
What I don't get
is you.

461
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,875
You're no hero wannabe
like the rest of them.

462
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,872
You're obviously
well off,

463
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,395
enough to not slum
around Star City.

464
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,560
So what are you
getting out of this?

465
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,793
Honestly...
I don't know.

466
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,076
Closure maybe,
to ask Felicity

467
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,799
why she disappeared
from my life

468
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,349
only to contact me now
out of the blue.

469
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,238
What, did you guys
date or something?

470
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,277
God, no. I'm gay,
and she's my mom.

471
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,714
Stepmom.

472
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,273
Oliver Queen is
your father?

473
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,432
Did you get anything
out of them?

474
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,512
You're supposed to be
watching the others.

475
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,039
Unh! Agh!

476
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,952
Hyaaah!

477
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,273
Hyaaah!

478
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,194
- Brace yourself.
- What?

479
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,794
Aah!

480
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,275
Roy!

481
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,800
- Ugh!
- Drop the bow.

482
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
You first.

483
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,016
I called the ambulance.
They're on their way.

484
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,554
They'll be here
any minute.

485
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,040
- Shh, shh, shh.
- D., d., relax.

486
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,656
Help's on the way.
You don't have to talk.

487
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,469
Oliver. Ohh. Oliver.

488
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,789
Oliver.

489
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,673
What the hell?

490
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,355
Slabside.
We found a uniform upstairs in the closet.

491
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,176
This guy must have been
in prison with Oliver.

492
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,078
So all of this,
the notes, the murders...

493
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,355
It's about Oliver.

494
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,315
Mmm. Sure beats our suppers in hope Springs,
hey, William?

495
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,550
Except when we
ate there,

496
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,518
I could actually
see my food.

497
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,856
Yeah. I'm sure they're working on
getting the power back on soon.

498
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,997
This storm is crazy.

499
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,551
I thought my chili
was your favorite, bud.

500
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,456
- It's too spicy.
- What are you talking about?

501
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,040
It's perfect.
It's absolutely delicious.

502
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,152
In fact, I will have seconds if you
could pass me some more, please.

503
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,197
I can't.

504
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,192
Felicity...

505
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,953
I can't really move.

506
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,520
I can't either.

507
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,273
What's that sound?

508
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,278
Dad, what's going on?

509
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,277
Don't worry, Oliver.
It's me.

510
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,909
I'm just really happy
to see you guys again.

511
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,192
It's so nice
to meet you, William.

512
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,151
I'm Stanley Dover.

513
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,675
I'm your dad's
best friend.

514
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,399
Stanley, don't hurt
my son.

515
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,791
Hurt him?
I don't want to hurt any of you.

516
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,510
I... I just need
to talk.

517
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,512
That's why I gave you
the medicine...

518
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,434
so you would
listen to me.

519
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,274
What kind
of medicine?

520
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,194
Don't worry. Its effects
are temporary.

521
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,439
I used to take this stuff all
the time when I was a kid.

522
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,239
My dad was a doctor.

523
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,754
Said you want to talk,
Stanley.

524
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,513
What do you want
to talk about?

525
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,273
I just have to
warn you

526
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,913
because those people,
they don't understand you like I do.

527
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,296
You can't believe anything
that they say.

528
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,118
Which people?

529
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,510
The people that call
themselves your friends.

530
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,040
I've been sending
them warnings,

531
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,600
but they haven't
listened.

532
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,717
Warnings?

533
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,553
What kind of warnings?
Like, notes?

534
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,994
Yeah.

535
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,190
You're the Star City
slayer.

536
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,597
Don't call me that.

537
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,591
I'm... I'm sorry.
Oliver, I'm sorry.

538
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,115
I just really
hate that name.

539
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,876
Look. No tricks
this time, OK?

540
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,432
I just really need
you to listen to me.

541
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,992
OK. All right, Stanley,

542
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,638
but this is between us...

543
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,911
So I need you to let
my wife and son go.

544
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,472
I can't because there's people
out there that want to hurt you,

545
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,029
who want to hurt
all of you.

546
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,238
If you knew the things that
I had to do to protect you.

547
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,877
But I know that you would
do the same thing for me.

548
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,356
I... I like that you're
working with the police.

549
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,272
Not everybody does.

550
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,477
There's people out there
that are saying

551
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,074
bad things about you.

552
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,117
They want to hurt you.

553
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,874
Like that councilman
that works with Diaz.

554
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,831
Some people don't
deserve to live.

555
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,559
Come on, Stanley.

556
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,112
My teammates
would never hurt me.

557
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,510
But they're still
bad for you,

558
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,717
worse even because they
don't understand you,

559
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,679
they don't understand
you like I do,

560
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,480
and I only had time
to correct one of them.

561
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,994
"Correct" them?

562
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,833
The police captain.

563
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,240
The Black Canary.

564
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,277
What did you
do to her?

565
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,636
It doesn't matter

566
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,355
because we're
together now,

567
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,000
and we can go somewhere new
and be a new team!

568
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,357
But I don't know about her

569
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,990
because I don't think
that she's been listening.

570
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,630
All right,
she's... she's listening.

571
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,120
Just a little scared,
all right?

572
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,113
Sure. I used to be scared

573
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,318
when my dad
gave me medicine.

574
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,831
He gave me medicine
whenever I was bad

575
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,116
or I didn't listen,

576
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,592
and so when
I couldn't move

577
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,191
and when I had to listen,

578
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,638
then he would correct me.

579
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,313
Your dad used to
hurt you?

580
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,234
He was just doing what he
thought was right for me.

581
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,312
My mother thought so, too.

582
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,031
My older brother,
he tried to protect me,

583
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,670
tried to take
my punishments for me,

584
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,240
but it only made it worse.

585
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,716
One day...

586
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,474
I couldn't take it anymore,

587
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,997
and I gave my parents
some medicine.

588
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,833
I corrected them.

589
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,072
Everybody's got to get back
at their parents sometimes,

590
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,595
right, William?

591
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,319
Right, buddy?

592
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,995
Stanley,
you said your brother.

593
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,230
Where's your brother now?

594
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,313
When he found out
what I did for him,

595
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,915
he got upset.

596
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,276
I don't know why.

597
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,512
He wanted to send me
to arkham asylum,

598
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,596
so I had to give him
some medicine, too.

599
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,637
I needed to correct him.

600
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,879
You killed
your own brother?

601
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,395
I didn't have a choice.

602
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,315
If he just listened
to me,

603
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,790
then I wouldn't have
had to do it,

604
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,315
and none of this
would have happened...

605
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,416
But I'm starting to think
that you're not listening

606
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,638
to me either, Oliver.

607
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,552
I can tell!

608
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,350
And you should have...
you should have apologized to me

609
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,352
for being mean to me
at slabside,

610
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,353
but you haven't,
so I'm starting to think

611
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,397
that you're just like
everybody else

612
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,991
and you don't deserve
my... my protection.

613
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,476
I'm sorry that you feel
that way, Stanley.

614
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,993
You're exactly like your father, Stanley.

615
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,718
You're wrong.
I'm nothing like him.

616
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,313
You're right,
you're right.

617
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,919
You're worse.

618
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,795
You're
the Star City slayer.

619
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,952
I told you
I hate that name!

620
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,440
William.

621
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,477
Agh!

622
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,155
Are you all right?

623
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,879
We are now.

624
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,031
Hey. Dinah's
in surgery now.

625
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,833
Doctors say
she'll be fine,

626
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,912
although they're not too
sure about her Voice yet.

627
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,639
Dover's been picked
up by SCPD.

628
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,496
They're transferring him
back to slabside tomorrow.

629
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,016
How many times
has he done this?

630
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,440
At least 3 that we know of.

631
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,910
It always involves some
older brother figure,

632
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,070
someone he admires.

633
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,470
Stanley starts off
by killing those he thinks

634
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,791
are bad for them
and not just enemies

635
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
but friends, as well.

636
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,318
Tries to impress them,
tries to endear himself,

637
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,835
and when that doesn't work,
they become his next target.

638
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,274
You guys OK, though?

639
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,999
So far, so good.
If there's any trace

640
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,576
of the drugs left in our system,
the doctors will find it

641
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,876
in the gallons of blood
they just siphoned from us.

642
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,873
I'm gonna go check on William
and get him discharged.

643
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,353
This is A.R.G.U.S.
we have to go.

644
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,991
Actually, John, uh...

645
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,037
You are taking
the position in D.C.

646
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,158
Look. I know that A.R.G.U.S.
does a lot of good,

647
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,074
but I'll never agree with
them on how they do it.

648
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,914
You have to do
what's right for you,

649
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,955
but I am gonna
miss you, Curtis.

650
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,269
I'm gonna miss you, too.

651
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,477
Sorry I didn't tell you.
Just with everything going on...

652
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,916
eh, Rene already
gave you up.

653
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,798
I was kind hoping
more for "boo-hoo.

654
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,950
"I'll miss you so much.

655
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,256
You're my other half
I'll never replace."

656
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,398
Yeah, but I'm really
happy that you're

657
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,800
finally doing
what you want.

658
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,031
I think it's time
you do the same.

659
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,673
- Yeah.
- I talked to my lawyer.

660
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,376
They're gonna draw up
some legal documents.

661
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,440
I'm signing over sole
ownership of helix to you.

662
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,874
You don't have to
do that.

663
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,394
I want to.

664
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,597
Helix was your idea,

665
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,353
and I love working
with you,

666
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,830
but it feels like
you're struggling

667
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,912
to find
your purpose, too.

668
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,116
Yeah.

669
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,078
Maybe this is it.

670
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,197
Maybe this is how Felicity
Smoak will change the world.

671
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,240
Well, you are right.

672
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,400
I am really
gonna miss you.

673
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,355
Hey.

674
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,556
Are we going home?

675
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,876
Well, that depends.

676
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,629
Do you want to go home?

677
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,549
What do you mean?

678
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,394
I mean you were right

679
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,757
that I never asked you
what you wanted.

680
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,914
So I'm asking now.

681
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,672
Would you like
to come home

682
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,229
and live with us?

683
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,880
Or do you want to go and
live with your grandparents?

684
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,631
I just want a normal life.

685
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,632
I want that
for you, too.

686
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,997
I thought I could...

687
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,760
Provide that
for you...

688
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,592
Especially since,
um, you know,

689
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,433
I've been unmasked.

690
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,632
After what happened tonight,
I see that, um...

691
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,159
Normal may never be
a real possibility.

692
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,477
I don't want you to stop
being a hero.

693
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,870
I know the city needs you.

694
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,474
I just think
for at least now,

695
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,234
it might be better for me
to be in Central City.

696
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,274
OK.

697
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,875
Then that's what
we'll do.

698
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,256
It gets really cold there
in the winter,

699
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,616
so I'm gonna send you,
like, 3 coats

700
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,552
and mitts and a hat.

701
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,000
You're definitely
gonna need a hat.

702
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,158
Ohh.

703
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,959
I'll miss you so much.

704
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,315
I'm gonna
miss you, too.

705
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,511
Listen here,
young man.

706
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,756
Wherever you are,
I'm always gonna be your dad.

707
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,750
So we'll talk
all the time... ahem...

708
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,320
and I promise to
come and visit

709
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,073
whenever it's cool
with you

710
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,793
and with your
grandparents.

711
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,999
You just have to
promise that you...

712
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,231
you will call me...

713
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,152
if you need anything, anything,
you will call me, OK?

714
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,357
- I will.
- You have a home

715
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,512
with the two of us
in Star City forever.

716
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,874
I love you, William.

717
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,235
I love you, too, dad.

718
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,479
Hi. Dr. Schwartz,
is everything OK?

719
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,176
Oh, good.
I thought it was gonna be one of those calls

720
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,999
where you say,
"everything spread to the liver," and...

721
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,550
I'm what?

722
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,915
You can't win this.

723
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,433
Drop
the damn knife.

724
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,877
Come on!
Don't give me a reason to pull this trigger.

725
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,357
You're not gonna
shoot me.

726
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,520
You sure about that?

727
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,790
Yeah...

728
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,990
Because my name
is Mia Smoak.

729
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,192
I'm Felicity's daughter

730
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,114
and your sister.

731
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,200
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
