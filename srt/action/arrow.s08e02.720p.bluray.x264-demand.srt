1
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:04,130
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:06,216
<i>For 7 years, I have fought
with only one goal...</i>

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:07,717
<i>to save my city,</i>

4
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:09,302
<i>but now a new threat
has emerged,</i>

5
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,179
<i>a danger so severe
it has forced me</i>

6
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:13,056
<i>to leave my family
in order to face it,</i>

7
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,725
<i>and it won't be enough for me
to just be the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,393
<i>To prevent the crisis
that's coming,</i>

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,395
<i>I am going to
have to become someone else,</i>

10
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,232
<i>I am going to have to
become... something else.</i>

11
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,734
<i>Previously on "Arrow"...</i>

12
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,701
We see the wall coming
down as an opportunity.

13
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,297
For the criminals
of Star City to

14
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,240
- rob the Glades blind.
- To reunite the city.

15
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,286
Ever since we brought
down the wall, your bro...

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,740
the Deathstroke gang...
has really upped their game.

17
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,205
<i>They've amassed more territory
and power than ever before.</i>

18
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,475
Your brother hates you.
That makes things unpredictable.

19
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,699
<i>Vasquez is one of
the Glades' wealthiest citizens.</i>

20
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,795
<i>Maybe the Deathstrokes
plan to extort him.</i>

21
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,255
A crisis is coming,
John.

22
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,066
- What are you doing here?
- Reminding you

23
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,008
what you are doing here,
which does not include

24
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,760
interfering in the events
of this Earth.

25
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:53,054
- The city's under attack.
- By who?

26
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,223
<i>A crisis is imminent.</i>

27
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,891
<i>Someone is coming,</i>

28
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,811
<i>someone far, far
more powerful than myself.</i>

29
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,988
We have to get
the hell out of here.

30
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,029
<i>I missed
you, buddy.</i>

31
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,196
<i>'Cause we found
ourselves in each other.</i>

32
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:15,118
<i>You're never
without me.</i>

33
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:16,452
<i>Beautiful boy.</i>

34
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:18,913
<i>What's happening?</i>

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,081
<i>Oliver!</i>

36
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:21,833
<i>Survive.</i>

37
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,391
I warned you not
to interfere.

38
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,227
You didn't bring
us here?

39
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,564
No. I discovered what
had transpired on Earth-2,

40
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,733
that you intervened
to save Laurel Lance.

41
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,067
I redirected you.

42
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:51,696
What... the hell
happened back there?

43
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:53,531
A herald of what
is to come,

44
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:56,034
an entire world erased
from existence.

45
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,660
Where's my mother?

46
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:03,333
Where's... where's
Tommy?

47
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,836
Where's... where's Rene,
where's Dinah?

48
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,379
They are no more.

49
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:11,674
Did you hurt
John and Laurel?

50
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,218
They are alive
and nearby,

51
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,638
but now you know
that if we fail to stop

52
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,805
the coming crisis,

53
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,557
what you witnessed
will occur

54
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,018
on infinite Earths
across the expanse of time.

55
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,355
How did I fail? Your dwarf star
particles are right there.

56
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,981
You disobeyed
my instructions

57
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,609
to avoid entanglements
on a parallel Earth.

58
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,152
You confronted
Tommy Merlyn.

59
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,279
You altered the fate
of Laurel Lance.

60
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,947
I watched her
die once.

61
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,618
Ok. I wasn't prepared
to do it again.

62
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:41,579
You are not a man accustomed to
following orders,

63
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:45,750
but the survival
of the multiverse requires

64
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,503
that you obey mine.

65
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,589
Where are we?

66
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,882
Your home Earth,

67
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,926
where you will
complete your next task.

68
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,595
There's a man named
Dr. Robert Wong.

69
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,305
Bring him to me.

70
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,891
- Why?
- Now, that is not your concern.

71
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,937
Do not fail me again.

72
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,942
Oliver, we have to
get out of here... now.

73
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:22,578
- Who are they?
- Local gang.

74
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,122
I think we busted
up a deal.

75
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,197
Nice of you to show up.

76
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,164
Where the hell
are we?

77
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,251
We're in Hong Kong.

78
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,313
It's... it's
not possible.

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,064
There's no way that
my entire Earth

80
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,608
is just...
is just gone.

81
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,818
You saw what happened
to the SCPD, right,

82
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,779
that energy wave,
people just disappearing?

83
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,381
That doesn't mean
it happened everywhere.

84
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:40,698
The Monitor told me
that it did.

85
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,992
- The what?
- His real name is Mar Novu...

86
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,452
Oh. You call
that a real name?

87
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,370
He's the one that
has asked me to be

88
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,538
on this mission.

89
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,499
He is trying to prevent
a crisis...

90
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,666
Oliver, just stop.

91
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,001
Hand me
the breach device.

92
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,128
Give it to me.
I'm going back.

93
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:55,588
Laurel,
back where?

94
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:56,839
To my Earth

95
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,342
to look for
any survivors.

96
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,681
- It's not working.
- Probably damaged

97
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,048
on our jump
through the portal.

98
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,477
We don't have time to go
all the way to S.T.A.R. Labs.

99
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,604
I... I have to find
somebody local.

100
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,611
I'm sorry, but we need to
focus on the mission.

101
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:14,968
First of all, there
is no we here,

102
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,943
and the only mission
that I care about

103
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,028
is saving what's
left of my Earth.

104
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,113
Laurel. Laurel!

105
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,116
There's no one left
to save.

106
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,993
The only thing that
we can do right now

107
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,079
is prevent this
from happening again

108
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,164
by doing what
the Monitor tells us...

109
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,541
screw the Monitor,
Oliver,

110
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,042
and screw you, too.

111
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,002
None of this would
have happened

112
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,755
if you hadn't shown up
on my Earth in the first place.

113
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,007
All of those people
that you saw die,

114
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,926
they weren't real
to you.

115
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,470
They were just copies
of the people that you love...

116
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,682
but that is my home,

117
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,853
and those people,
those are real people

118
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,229
who are counting
on me...

119
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:56,023
Adrian, my sister.

120
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,651
I just got
my life back,

121
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,611
and I am not giving
it up without a fight.

122
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:04,907
Let her go, man.

123
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,492
She's wasting
her time, John.

124
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,035
She's processing
her grief,

125
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,121
and if we have
a new mission

126
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:11,765
and the multiverse
depends on it, Oliver,

127
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,499
we have to get
going right now.

128
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,671
Anyone want to fill me
in on what happened out there?

129
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,464
I almost got
my throat slit.

130
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,819
Turns out Connor doesn't know
his brother as well as he thinks.

131
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,487
Hey, we're
all still alive, aren't we?

132
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,096
Which means what
exactly,

133
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:28,783
that your brother's
not such a bad guy?

134
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,601
All I'm saying is JJ could have
killed you, and he didn't.

135
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,145
Wow! That is some
serious denial.

136
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,689
To answer your question,
nothing good.

137
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,024
What about
Alberto Vasquez?

138
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,152
He's safe, but he'd already
given JJ what he was after.

139
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,963
- Which was?
- Access codes

140
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,031
to the private vault
in Vasquez's penthouse.

141
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,550
Yeah. Well, we
went to the vault,

142
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,335
but by the time we got there, it had
already been trashed and emptied.

143
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,703
This is all that was left.

144
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,582
Flash storage from
the vault's security mainframe.

145
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah. Don't get
too excited.

146
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,835
- It's totally fried.
- Not to brag,

147
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,212
but totally fried is
kind of my wheelhouse.

148
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,673
If I can fix it,
I'll be able to extract

149
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,091
the vault's
security log.

150
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,736
Finding out what
the Deathstrokes stole

151
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,237
could help us figure out
what they're planning next.

152
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,804
We already know
what they're planning.

153
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,181
JJ wants to take
over the city.

154
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,390
He needs the cash
to do it.

155
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,757
Well, Vasquez did say
the vault was full of valuables...

156
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,186
jewelry, cash.

157
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:17,521
So we figure out where JJ's
gonna sell, take him out.

158
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,008
I know exactly where you'd go
to move that kind of product.

159
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,477
You're not the only one
around here with street smarts.

160
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:26,364
Ok. We'll find JJ,
take him out of play.

161
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,617
Stay here. Fix that
useless piece of junk,

162
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,287
and, you, next time
I see your brother,

163
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,790
don't get in my way.

164
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,015
Harbinger sends
her regards.

165
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:12,284
Oh. This would have come
in handy 10 years ago.

166
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,179
Well, it helps to be
married to Lyla Michaels,

167
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,788
who is en route even
as we speak.

168
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,541
John, I didn't even want
to get you involved in this.

169
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,710
I know, but if what
you told me is true,

170
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,713
which is that we're
facing the destruction of...

171
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,840
well, hell, man,
pretty much everything,

172
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,610
then to me that's the very
definition of all hands on deck.

173
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,635
Check this out.

174
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:34,598
Now this machine is hooked up
to A.R.G.U.S.'s intranet,

175
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,643
so we can access all
the information it has on Dr. Wong.

176
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,999
You want to tell me
what that face is all about,

177
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,223
or are you gonna
make me guess?

178
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,360
Laurel. She was right.

179
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,779
The Monitor warned me
not to get involved,

180
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,283
and, I don't know,
if I'd just found

181
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,635
a way to get
the dwarf star particles

182
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,637
without trying to stop
Tommy's Undertaking, then...

183
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,597
Oliver, what were you supposed to do,
just sit back and let it happen?

184
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,750
I ignored the orders
of a cosmic being,

185
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,086
and as a result,
I watched an entire world just

186
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,423
disappear, so...

187
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,051
I'm just trying not to make
the same mistake twice.

188
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,219
Well, if this
cosmic being wanted

189
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,306
someone willing to watch
the mass murder of innocent people,

190
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,601
then... he picked
the wrong hero.

191
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,970
Shouldn't blame
yourself, man.

192
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,063
Well, what about my behavior
over the past 7 years

193
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,024
has given you the impression
that I would?

194
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,818
- Got him.
- Good.

195
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,237
Dr. Robert Wong,
renowned biophysicist.

196
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,906
Won the Nobel Prize
in the specialty

197
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,408
of complex proteins
and antibodies.

198
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,453
First the dwarf star particles,
now a mysterious scientist.

199
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,700
Can't the Monitor just
snap his fingers and get both?

200
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,333
Well, he's not the biggest
fan of sharing information.

201
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,294
Ok. Looks like Dr. Wong
might not be that easy to find.

202
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,922
He's been missing a week.
This is the last-known photo.

203
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,049
Wan Chai University.
He's a professor.

204
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,258
That's where we start.

205
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,761
We need to do things quietly,
stay under the radar.

206
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,474
Too late.

207
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,138
Agh!

208
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:44,895
Tatsu?

209
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,242
You will be safe here.

210
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,913
So who were those men,
Triad?

211
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,874
Shu gang,
their rivals.

212
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,542
Why are you
in Hong Kong?

213
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,645
I thought you were with
the Crescent Order.

214
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,213
I was until I gave Nyssa
the Lotus cure

215
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,506
to save your sister,

216
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,216
and they called
for my head.

217
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,926
So you decided to become
a vigilante?

218
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,803
My son died
in this city.

219
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,055
No more Akios
will die here

220
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,308
as long as I'm here
to protect them.

221
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,561
That explains what
I'm doing here.

222
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,856
It's all you, man.

223
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:32,067
Right. We're looking
for a scientist named Dr. Robert Wong.

224
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,695
- Why?
- There's a crisis coming

225
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,949
that... quite literally threatens
the entire universe.

226
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:43,662
A man... something
like a man

227
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,123
has asked me to
help him stop it.

228
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:50,294
- You mean Mar Novu?
- You've heard of him?

229
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,087
When I was with
the Crescent Order.

230
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,548
A being who
transcends universes,

231
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,343
a crisis brewing.

232
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,149
He believes Dr. Wong
can help him stop it.

233
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,304
And you believe him?

234
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,513
I have to.

235
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,600
Then how can I help?

236
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,407
Tatsu, what we're
doing is very dangerous.

237
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,230
I... I can't ask you
to be involved.

238
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,565
You're not asking.
I'm offering.

239
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,615
Dr. Wong was seen
last leaving his classroom

240
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:20,950
at Wan Chai University.

241
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,701
That was a week ago.

242
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,946
We're trying to figure out why
he would have left town.

243
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,665
I don't think he has.

244
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,458
Those pins,
they're only worn

245
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,751
by the Security Wing,

246
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,628
Hong Kong version
of the secret police.

247
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,115
With a very healthy
reputation for

248
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,813
silencing political
enemies of the state.

249
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,133
Yeah, but why would
they be going after Dr. Wong?

250
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,302
We need to find out.

251
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,881
Johnny told me you were
about to do something stupid.

252
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,318
He called you all the way
to Hong Kong to follow me?

253
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,445
- How nice.
- He thought you could use some help.

254
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,655
Clearly, he was right.

255
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,949
Clearly, he needs to mind
his own business.

256
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,716
He said you're looking
for an old friend.

257
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,251
Doesn't seem like
the kind who's too friendly.

258
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,415
His name is David Chin.
I met him a few years ago

259
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,666
through Cayden James.

260
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,626
He said he could help me
get back to Earth-2

261
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,628
so maybe he still can.

262
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,587
Do you have any idea
what you're about to walk into?

263
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,969
Nothing that I can't
handle myself.

264
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,770
You'll need backup.

265
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,246
What the hell?

266
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,999
I wouldn't.

267
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,710
Hello, David.
It's been a while.

268
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,961
Black Siren?

269
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,671
David, I'm gonna
need your help,

270
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,131
and if you don't
help me,

271
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,884
then I am gonna
hurt you very, very badly.

272
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,177
What do you want?

273
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,223
Whoa? Is that
an interdimensional extrapolator?

274
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,392
If that's nerd talk
for breach device, then yes,

275
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,977
and I need you
to fix it.

276
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,563
That's not really
my area of expertise.

277
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,983
Okay, okay.

278
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,361
I'll do it.

279
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,447
Good. I'm so glad
you reconsidered.

280
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,789
So this is, what,
like a black market?

281
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,290
More or less.

282
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,000
JJ wants to find a buyer,

283
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,210
this is where he'll be.

284
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,671
<i>♪ I got a number,
I got a name ♪</i>

285
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,092
<i>♪ I got a target,
it has a face ♪</i>

286
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,551
I'll check the back.

287
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,639
See, I still don't get it.

288
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,226
Your dad was Bronze Tiger,
and you turned out okay.

289
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,269
I mean, kind of.

290
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,188
Gee. Thanks.

291
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,400
John and Lyla were
basically saints.

292
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,945
Yeah. Well, they spent
all their time worrying about me.

293
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,114
JJ got shortchanged.

294
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,493
Hey. You think JJ
turned out this way 'cause of you?

295
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,287
No. JJ made
his own choices.

296
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,456
I know you want to
believe that deep down

297
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,823
there's still some
good in him.

298
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:16,959
There is.

299
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,086
JJ wasn't just
my brother, okay?

300
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,462
He was my best friend.

301
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,839
That was a long time ago.

302
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,195
Come to have a drink
with me, little bro?

303
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,559
- This is over, JJ.
- I don't think so.

304
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,109
- Put down your weapons.
- You first.

305
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,115
Maybe there's a better way that
we can resolve this.

306
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,537
No, no, no.
We can resolve this

307
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:54,872
by you coming with us.

308
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,040
You know, I wish
that I could. I do,

309
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,209
I do, but I got
business to attend to.

310
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:04,131
I would settle for a friendly chat
with my brother.

311
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,591
What you think?

312
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,134
I think that's never
gonna happen.

313
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,722
Fine.

314
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,516
You want to talk,
we'll talk.

315
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,352
That looked like
that hurt.

316
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,203
<i>Knowing you
has changed my life.</i>

317
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,043
<i>We're gonna be fine.</i>

318
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,884
I spoke to contact
on Hong Kong police force.

319
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,679
As soon as I mentioned Dr. Wong's name,
he stopped talking.

320
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,556
- He seemed afraid.
- I think we know why.

321
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,117
It seems that Dr. Wong
has been working

322
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,119
on a top secret project
for the Chinese government.

323
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,229
Exactly, which means
the Security Wing

324
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,564
wasn't kidnapping him.
It was trying to help him.

325
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,233
He must be in
protective custody.

326
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,799
Safe house
in the Wan Chai district,

327
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,754
but they're planning on moving
him out of the city tonight.

328
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,321
Then we better
get moving.

329
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,125
Don't hurt me.

330
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,131
Triad.

331
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,066
We can't let them get
away with Dr. Wong.

332
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,971
We won't.
Go, go, go, go!

333
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,101
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

334
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,111
Welcome back
to Hong Kong.

335
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,992
Hyah! Hyah!

336
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,043
Agh! Ugh!

337
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,378
- Hyah!
- Unh!

338
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,595
Gah!

339
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,902
- It's gas.
- Got to get these people out of here.

340
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,655
We can't lose
the doctor.

341
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,758
No sign of Dr. Wong.

342
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,302
Triad must have taken him
deep underground.

343
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,263
I thought China White was in
A.R.G.U.S. custody.

344
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,099
Yeah. Well, so did I,
and as far as I know, Lyla did, too.

345
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,061
Well, our situation just got
a whole lot more complicated.

346
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,539
You seemed ready
to let those people die back there.

347
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,939
I knew you had it
handled,

348
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,817
and you knew that Dr. Wong
was the priority.

349
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,111
You sound like someone
I used to know...

350
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,656
you nine years ago,

351
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,282
single-minded
about your mission.

352
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,009
Tatsu, with due respect,
if you had seen

353
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,078
what I have seen,
you would understand.

354
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:24,122
The Monitor is our
best chance at preventing it

355
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,374
from happening again.

356
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,918
I've seen that blind faith
in you before, as well,

357
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,419
with Amanda Waller.

358
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,213
That wasn't blind faith.

359
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,424
She threatened
my family, Tatsu.

360
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,428
Right now, the stakes
are every family in existence.

361
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,806
Guys, I really
hate to interrupt this,

362
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,641
but none of this matters
if we don't find

363
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,142
this missing scientist, right?

364
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,895
Why does the Triad
want him?

365
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,596
His work does not
seem harmful.

366
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,090
Yeah? Well, innocent
men don't work

367
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,308
on secret
government projects.

368
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,901
We need to know what
this project is.

369
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,832
Then we'll know
why the Triad is after him.

370
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,494
I don't like this.

371
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,912
He's stalling.

372
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,128
Hey. Hey!

373
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,921
What's taking so long?

374
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,549
- It's done.
- Great.

375
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,177
So you won't mind
if we test it out.

376
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,226
It isn't working.

377
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,145
Well, it should be.

378
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,771
Then where's
the portal?

379
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:34,067
You want to go
to Earth-37, Earth-14?

380
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,486
I want to go
to Earth-2.

381
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,155
Earth-2...

382
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,575
is gone.

383
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,537
It registered at first,
but now I see that it's like a shadow.

384
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,458
There's no sign of life.

385
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,378
That doesn't make any sense.

386
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,178
You're lying.
Fix it! Fix it!

387
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,721
I'm telling you I did.

388
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,222
I can fix tech.
I can't bring back

389
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,724
a whole
friggin' universe!

390
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,895
I'm so sorry,
Laurel...

391
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,023
but they're gone.

392
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,157
Let's get out of here.

393
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,159
Laurel!

394
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:25,786
Now!

395
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,457
There's nothing in any
governmental databases

396
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,793
of the project
Dr. Wong was working on.

397
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,920
- So we're back to square one?
- No, not exactly.

398
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,255
An A.R.G.U.S. mole led
me to a paper trail,

399
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,965
some equipment that
Dr. Wong purchased.

400
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,292
He shipped it
to this address.

401
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,623
Well, it's his lab. It has to be.
We need to get in there.

402
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,054
That may not be
so easy.

403
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:47,015
I know this place.
It's a PLA garrison.

404
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,767
Oh. Those garrisons
have a reputation

405
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,227
for being
almost impenetrable.

406
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,853
Almost but not quite.

407
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,108
There are certain
vulnerabilities.

408
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,920
Yeah. Well, even if we
could get in that place,

409
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,195
it's gonna be
heavily fortified.

410
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,197
That's never stopped
us before.

411
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,480
Ow.

412
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,608
I'm almost
at the sublevel.

413
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,861
The elevator will take
you straight to the lab.

414
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,487
Most likely
will be guarded.

415
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,969
All right. I've
definitely been made.

416
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,244
You only have
a few minutes.

417
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,208
I'm starting the upload.

418
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,011
What? What is it?

419
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,096
I know what the Triad
is after.

420
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,141
Dr. Wong has been trying
to re-create

421
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,309
the Alpha-Omega virus.

422
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,190
He's not trying.
He's already done it.

423
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,548
After what happened
last time, you'd think

424
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,137
the Chinese government
would have learned its lesson.

425
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,038
The Alpha-Omega is
a powerful weapon.

426
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,765
Yeah, and the Triad
could already have it.

427
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,029
If they had it, they wouldn't
have any need for Dr. Wong.

428
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,645
It's just a matter of time
before they make him re-create it.

429
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,005
Which means, Oliver,
that we have a ticking clock

430
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,007
and absolutely no plan.

431
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,302
- We have this.
- You stole the virus?

432
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,678
This is what
China White wants,

433
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:49,989
this is what I'm
gonna give her.

434
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,283
Oliver, you more than anyone else
knows how dangerous this is.

435
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,243
Which is why I'm not actually
gonna give her the virus.

436
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,936
We're using this
as bait to draw her out.

437
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,188
My husband tried
this gambit once already,

438
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,982
and you're the one
who told him he made a mistake.

439
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,400
This is different.

440
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,110
Maseo had every
intention

441
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,071
of actually giving the virus
to China White.

442
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,114
- I don't.
- It's too risky.

443
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,699
It's riskier
to do nothing.

444
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,286
If anyone has
a better idea,

445
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,705
I'm all ears.

446
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,630
I'll start
making arrangements.

447
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:43,400
Here. It'll help
with the swelling.

448
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,987
I don't have anyone here who cares
if I come home with bruised knuckles.

449
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,992
I'm here. I care.

450
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,620
You barely even
know me.

451
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,373
I know what
it's like to lose people.

452
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,835
Do you know what it's like
to lose an entire universe?

453
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,046
No.

454
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,632
Then you don't know
how I feel.

455
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,094
You didn't know them.

456
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:18,059
My sister, Adrian,
they're my family,

457
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,729
they're... they're
good people.

458
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,232
They don't deserve
to be gone.

459
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,571
To think that I'm the one
who's done such awful things.

460
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,656
But you're trying
to be better.

461
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,075
Everyone deserves a shot
at redemption.

462
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,536
Well, then maybe this is
where I deserve to be.

463
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,832
When I was
in Afghanistan,

464
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,085
my unit got sent
out on patrol

465
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,837
on a day I drew
base duty.

466
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,922
It was a routine op.

467
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,216
We'd done it
a hundred times before.

468
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:55,263
Only this time,
there was an IED in the road.

469
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,518
None of them made it back.

470
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,774
I used to lie in bed at night

471
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,400
asking myself,

472
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,153
"Why them?

473
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,697
Why not me?"

474
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,785
And I made every deal
I could think of

475
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,329
with any god
I thought might listen.

476
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,872
And did it work?

477
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,126
Not exactly.

478
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,130
So you're right.

479
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,235
I don't know what
you're going through,

480
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,221
but I do know something
about survivor's guilt.

481
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,765
Does it get
any easier?

482
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,060
No.

483
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,562
All we can do is
try and move forward.

484
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,777
How am I supposed
to move forward

485
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,572
when everyone I've
ever loved is gone?

486
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,951
By not giving up.

487
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,703
By doing the right thing.

488
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:05,792
We honor the dead
by fighting for the living.

489
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,464
This world needs
you, too.

490
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,180
You're not talking
me out of this.

491
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,155
- I know.
- Trust me, Tatsu.

492
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,366
I will not let
China White get the virus.

493
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,535
- And what if you fail?
- I'm not gonna fail.

494
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:45,748
Nine years ago,
you failed to stop the virus,

495
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,167
and my son died.

496
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,626
And I regret it
every day.

497
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:49,961
You must remember it

498
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,963
because of
what happened after.

499
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,631
I tortured
General Shrieve.

500
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,135
Your grief, your anger,
your guilt over the failure,

501
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,553
it stole your humanity.

502
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,638
This is different.
I'm not angry.

503
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,433
I'm simply doing
what has to be done.

504
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,601
How do you know that?

505
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,687
It is said that Mar Novu
believes order comes through chaos.

506
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,230
So he's bringing
us order?

507
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,065
But first may be chaos.

508
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,193
He's asking you to bring
him a man

509
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,945
who re-created
a deadly virus. Why?

510
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,674
How do you know he won't use it
for something worse than the Triad?

511
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:19,699
I don't know,

512
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,952
but I have to
believe him.

513
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,621
I have no other choice.

514
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,372
Even if that is true,

515
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,918
he does not seem to care
who he hurts along the way.

516
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,297
Sometimes, the mission
is not worth the cost.

517
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,049
You know that,

518
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,761
so why are you still
doing what he asks?

519
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,138
Because if I'm wrong...

520
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:47,310
if I'm wrong,
then all of this is for nothing.

521
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,229
Do you understand,
Tatsu?

522
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,022
I left Felicity.

523
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,108
I left my children,

524
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,820
so if... if... if the...
if the Monitor can't fix this

525
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,322
and if he is not
here to help,

526
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,699
then all of these
things that I've sacrificed

527
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,327
and all the things
that so many other people

528
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,163
have already sacrificed
will have been for nothing.

529
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,626
I need my family
to live,

530
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:17,548
which means that
I need this to work.

531
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,592
You're risking too much.

532
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,843
There's no other choice.

533
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,720
There's always
another choice.

534
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:39,153
You seem stressed. Relax.

535
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,989
You said you
wanted to talk,

536
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:43,533
so talk.

537
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,286
Still can't believe that you
decided to become a vigilante.

538
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,080
You know you always have
a place here with us.

539
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,540
You do have the mark.

540
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,749
You know why I got it.

541
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,210
That's right. You and Dad's
brilliant plan

542
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,920
to save me
from the dark side.

543
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,172
I got it because I
wanted my brother back.

544
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,481
You remember when I was
in middle school?

545
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,945
Remember when those guys
tried to get me to run their drugs?

546
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,388
Not really in the mood for
a trip down memory lane, Con.

547
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:07,557
When you found out,
you were the one

548
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,201
that told me that I
was better than that.

549
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,625
Yeah. My favorite part
of that story

550
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,603
is when you didn't
listen

551
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,522
and I got grounded.

552
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,984
Dad held me responsible.

553
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:20,820
You want to hate me?

554
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,115
You want to hate Dad?
Fine. Ok.

555
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:25,742
That... that's fair.

556
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,994
Don't throw your life
away because of it.

557
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,455
When I look at you,
I still see

558
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,374
the kid who'd take on
somebody twice his size

559
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,043
just because he was
messing with me.

560
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,609
Yeah. I'm not that kid
anymore, Con.

561
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:37,795
Yes, you are,

562
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,839
and you can try...
you can try

563
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,966
to snuff it out,
to cover it up with a mask,

564
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,177
but I know
who you are,

565
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,220
and it's not
too late.

566
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,601
And we can fix
this... together.

567
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:06,199
You're late. I thought perhaps
you changed your mind.

568
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,492
Deal's a deal.

569
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,702
Thank you
for meeting me.

570
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,287
Anything
for a friend.

571
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:18,336
Now I have
the virus.

572
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:21,464
- Where's Dr. Wong?
- He's nearby.

573
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,674
I was surprised
when I got your call.

574
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,111
Well, I'm surprised that
you're not in an A.R.G.U.S. prison.

575
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,780
Well, apparently
the government doesn't like

576
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,181
when agents put bombs
in people's necks.

577
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,017
You know what else
they don't like? Bad press.

578
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,394
So they bought
your silence.

579
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,020
It's a shame
your friend Mr. Diggle

580
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,772
had to lose his job
over it.

581
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,440
I assume he's
here, too.

582
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,568
Perimeter's clean.

583
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,404
Tatsu, any sign
of Dr. Wong?

584
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,532
<i>Not yet.</i>

585
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,075
I don't think he's here.

586
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,536
Wait. Someone's coming.

587
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,081
Oliver, keep
her talking.

588
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,292
You and I...

589
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,964
we have been enemies
since the very beginning,

590
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,924
but there's
something coming.

591
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,592
It's bigger than us.

592
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,345
It is something
that threatens

593
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,013
our entire Earth.

594
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,392
- Let me see him.
- Give me the case.

595
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,028
Tatsu, we have to
move now.

596
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,905
I see him.
I'm going in.

597
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:33,202
Wait. He's wearing
some kind of vest.

598
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,037
<i>It looks like explosives.</i>

599
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,765
<i>China White
must have a detonator.</i>

600
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,666
It's real.

601
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:50,511
That vest is not part
of the agreement.

602
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,889
I had to be sure you weren't
gonna do anything stupid.

603
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,766
I'll deactivate it
once I'm safe in the car.

604
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,561
Until next time,
Mr. Queen.

605
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,396
There's not gonna be
a next time.

606
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,065
Now.

607
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,570
Hyah!

608
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,956
Damn it! I'm going
after the virus!

609
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:47,276
Chien Na Wei.

610
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,736
Tatsu Yamashiro.

611
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,781
You really think this will go better
than the last time?

612
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,306
I have Dr. Wong.

613
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,397
Hi, honey.

614
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,108
Virus is secure.

615
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,910
I can't remove the vest
without triggering it.

616
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,738
We need
that detonator.

617
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,060
Unh!

618
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,524
The detonator.

619
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:15,865
You better kill
me now.

620
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,553
<i>I have the detonator.</i>

621
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:30,713
Tatsu?

622
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,434
Unh.

623
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,623
<i>Looks like I'm not
the only one who needed backup.</i>

624
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,465
Tatsu's resting
in the infirmary.

625
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,802
She'll be in pain for a few days,
but she'll be fine.

626
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,136
She would have
been dead

627
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,806
if you hadn't have come back
and fought with us.

628
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,308
I don't know if I'll ever
get over what happened

629
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:25,851
on Earth-2, but...

630
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,984
I'll help you make sure
it never happens again.

631
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,208
Well, at least
we accomplished our objective.

632
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,775
- How's Dr. Wong?
- He's fine.

633
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,402
In a secure location.

634
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,028
The virus is, too.

635
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:37,988
And so what...
what, do we text

636
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,425
the Monitor or whatever,
letting him know we have his guy?

637
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,492
Don't think he texts.

638
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,328
I don't want to hand
over Dr. Wong just yet.

639
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,748
I want answers, and if he
is not gonna give them to me,

640
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,275
I'm gonna find them
somewhere else.

641
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,477
Oliver, what are
you talking about?

642
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,502
Tatsu...

643
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,048
she told me
that I had to be

644
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,427
absolutely sure that I was making
the right choice.

645
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,389
She almost died, John.

646
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,561
A lot of people have
died already

647
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,521
for the sake
of this mission.

648
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,274
I owe it to all
of them to find out

649
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,234
who the Monitor
really is.

650
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:18,001
And, Oliver, what if we don't like
the answers to those questions?

651
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,321
What do we do then?

652
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,948
We find another way
to stop it.

653
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:24,744
There's always
another way.

654
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,124
Oliver,
so what's the plan?

655
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,293
I need to apologize
to a friend of mine first.

656
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,635
So... what do you say?

657
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,804
How about you and me
leave together?

658
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:48,726
It was a nice speech,
but once again,

659
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,937
you have managed to
make everything about you.

660
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,232
This isn't about you
or Dad.

661
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,027
Yeah, you both have
this misguided idea

662
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,572
about duty and family,
civic pride.

663
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,159
You fail to see
the bigger picture.

664
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,370
I have vision.

665
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,914
What are you
talking about?

666
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,615
Did you really not think that
I knew you'd show up here?

667
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,009
Yes. Worthless piece
of junk, my ass.

668
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,805
What the hell did
the Deathstrokes want with this?

669
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,056
What did you do?

670
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,058
What did you do?!

671
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:30,810
Oh. Hey, hey.
I knew that you thought

672
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,604
that I'd be after the
valuables in Vasquez's safe

673
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:36,315
and that Zoe would lead
you here,

674
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:39,193
the one shady trading post
that she knows about, right?

675
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,820
You were never
after the money.

676
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,697
Why cripple the system
when you can rip its heart out?

677
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,661
Oh, my God.

678
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:51,205
Once the unification
movement is gone,

679
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,416
the power vacuum is
ours to fill.

680
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,813
- I think we're done here.
- Not even close.

681
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:58,877
You are not gonna
touch me.

682
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,005
Oh, yeah?
And why is that?

683
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,423
Because if you do,

684
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,051
the men who are storming
your bunker right now

685
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,427
will kill your brother.

686
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,064
William?

687
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:21,277
William, do you copy?

688
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,446
Like I said,
I think we're done here.

689
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,909
If you hurt my brother,
I swear I will kill you.

690
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,080
JJ... please.

691
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,165
You were wrong
about me, brother.

692
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,753
It was never a mask.

693
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,561
Think the doctors would have
preferred you stay in the hospital.

694
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,231
I have survived worse.

695
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,860
Brought you something.

696
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,742
- Herbs.
- There's a rumor going around

697
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,243
they help with healing.

698
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:14,538
I have seen
many battles.

699
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,832
For a moment,
I believed

700
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,626
this was my last.

701
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,129
I saw Akio and Maseo,

702
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,343
but... this was
not my time.

703
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,887
Tatsu, you almost died
because of me.

704
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,141
I'm sorry.

705
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,938
Well, you were right
when you said that

706
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,441
some missions aren't
worth the cost,

707
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,236
so I'm gonna make sure
that this one is.

708
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,615
So where will you go?

709
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:53,702
You heard a rumor about
the Monitor and a coming crisis?

710
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,037
I doubt
the Crescent Order

711
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,705
will have
the answers you seek.

712
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,708
Thankfully, there are
organizations on this Earth

713
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,545
far, far older
than the Crescent Order.

714
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:07,257
I'm going
to Nanda Parbat.

715
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,941
You should have told me
what was going to happen on Earth-2.

716
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,825
John was there.
He could have been killed.

717
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,953
The destruction of that Earth
was a necessary sacrifice.

718
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,621
And what about
Laurel Lance?

719
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,082
Her friends,
her family...

720
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:42,334
Countless more like them
will perish

721
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,712
if we do not ensure that
Oliver Queen is prepared

722
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,171
for what is coming.

723
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,216
Were you successful?

724
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:53,137
Yes. I have Dr. Wong.

725
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,889
Then let us proceed.

726
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,044
Greg, move your head!
