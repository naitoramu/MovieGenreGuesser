1
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:03,338
<i>Previously on "Arrow"...</i>

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:06,257
This place looks exactly
like it did when I was 13.

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,744
We had planned
to come back here with both of you.

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,361
Yeah. That didn't
really work out.

5
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:11,387
Because I died.

6
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:13,932
Have you come to doubt
your commitment to this mission?

7
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:16,017
<i>It might help
if I actually knew why.</i>

8
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,769
<i>The recovery
of your universe</i>

9
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,896
<i>will require
a single task.</i>

10
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:22,023
You must betray
Oliver Queen.

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,584
<i>If saving it means
going back</i>

12
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:24,835
to the person
that I used to be,

13
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,319
then what the hell
is the point?

14
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:27,402
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,537
<i>Tark drives the lane.</i>

16
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,423
<i>Kicks it to Aldrich
in the corner for three.</i>

17
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:41,167
<i>Bingo! Count it and the foul.</i>

18
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,169
Ohh.

19
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,547
<i>Comets, who have
stormed all the way back</i>

20
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,382
<i>to tie it up
in the fourth quarter.</i>

21
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,009
No way.
It tastes the same.

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,279
I'm telling you these
Big Belly Burgers are just better.

23
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,423
I think he's right.

24
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:54,973
This is pre-Gwespin
Foods merger.

25
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,183
Dad, what are you
still doing here?

26
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,228
How did we
get here?

27
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:01,437
What do you mean?

28
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:05,108
Uh, I was on a roof
with John and Laurel,

29
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,026
and we were tranqed.

30
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,861
Yeah. By Lyla.

31
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,239
Look, Dad said it was all
just a big misunderstanding.

32
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:19,163
Ahem. What did we do with
Burov's plan for the weapon?

33
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,957
You said we didn't
need it anymore.

34
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,585
Why? The Monitor's
still out there.

35
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,794
He's still a threat.

36
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:26,212
Dad, are you okay?

37
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,756
You... you look like
you don't remember any of this.

38
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,091
I...

39
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,636
I need to talk to John.

40
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,722
That should
be easy.

41
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,849
He's waiting for you at that
fancy fundraiser.

42
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,185
What fundraiser?

43
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,271
The one you're
very late for.

44
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,190
I mean, you do remember
you're Oliver Queen, right?

45
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,910
Hey, Queen,
what's the difference

46
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,787
between a cop
and the Green Arrow?

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,165
Cop doesn't need
to play dress-up to do his job.

48
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,293
Ha. Yeah, sure thing. Ohh!

49
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,088
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Queen.
- It's fine, it's fine.

50
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,465
There you
are, man.

51
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,884
Party started
an hour ago, Oliver.

52
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,149
Do you remember
getting tranqed last night?

53
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:19,432
Yeah. Um, Lyla
feels awful about that.

54
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,410
By the way,
that wasn't last night.

55
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,728
- That was two days ago.
- What? No.

56
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,064
No, no. That...
John, that is the last thing

57
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,982
that I remember
before waking up

58
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,817
in my apartment
earlier tonight.

59
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,986
You okay, man?

60
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,991
No. This is... this...
is this the...

61
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,159
this is the Monitor.

62
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,536
- Oliver.
- Your wife is working

63
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:41,996
with the Monitor, John.
What...

64
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,763
I thought we
already settled this.

65
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,876
I have been working with
the Monitor but as a double agent,

66
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,670
which I told you
on the roof.

67
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,213
I don't... I don't
remember that.

68
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,547
I'm not remembering
anything.

69
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,108
Oliver, look. Just maybe
you should go home, man,

70
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,551
get a little sleep, okay,
just some rest.

71
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,918
Oliver, there you are.
Mayor's looking for you. Come on.

72
00:02:58,638 --> 00:02:59,764
What?

73
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,475
- What happened there?
- Oh.

74
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,352
Can't give a speech
with a stained shirt.

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,479
Give a s... what speech?
I'm giving a speech?

76
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,898
Very funny.
Your joint remarks with the mayor.

77
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,695
Rene, um, serious question.

78
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,698
When did Palmer Tech
get rebuilt?

79
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,450
You really need to drop
this amnesia routine quick.

80
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,494
This fundraiser is
our only chance to take

81
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,247
the SCPD Vigilante
Pilot Program global.

82
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,998
The mayor needs you
to be on point.

83
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,458
- He's waiting for you.
- He who?

84
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,168
Isn't... isn't
Pollard the mayor?

85
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,795
In her dreams maybe.

86
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,119
What's the matter, Oliver?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

87
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,539
So listen. I was
thinking about making

88
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,856
a few changes
to the speech,

89
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,775
so I figured I should
run it by you first.

90
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,529
This is not possible.
This is...

91
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,198
What? Don't tell me
you're scared

92
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,125
of a little last-minute
memorization, Oliver.

93
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,455
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

94
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,875
Couple of days maybe.
You're looking at me like it's been years.

95
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,324
No. You're right.
A couple days.

96
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,755
Right. So listen.
I was thinking

97
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,673
about adding a line
about, you know,

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,050
me telling you it was
a bad idea to unmask,

99
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,303
but, you know, maybe
a joke about how

100
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,710
you'd rather take it
to supermax

101
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:22,764
than take my advice.

102
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,432
Heh. You know?
What do you think?

103
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,560
You know that I went
to Slabside?

104
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,229
Uh... yeah.
What's that,

105
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,556
your way of saying
I should have come visit more often?

106
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,318
Quentin, right before
I turned myself in...

107
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,364
Diaz shot you, right?

108
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,532
Oh. Yeah.

109
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,118
That son of a bitch
almost killed me.

110
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,496
Almost died in the O.R.
You don't remember?

111
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,916
I remember it differently.

112
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,795
Well, the doctors
called it a miracle.

113
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,296
I was without oxygen
for so long,

114
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,839
I should have been
six feet under.

115
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,550
Felt like I escaped
my fate or something.

116
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:02,637
Hey. There's
something you need to see.

117
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:12,063
So... there's a hostage
situation at the SCPD.

118
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,030
The leader's demanding
to meet with the mayor.

119
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,145
No. You can't
go down there.

120
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,818
We'll call in
a special-ops team.

121
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,862
I'm the mayor. Nobody
does my dirty work for me.

122
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,280
Give my apologies
to the guests.

123
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,115
I'm... I'm gonna come
with you.

124
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,362
Okay, but you might want
to bring a change of clothes

125
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,483
because something tells me
we're gonna need the green guy.

126
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,214
Get the feds on the line.
Tell them I need backup

127
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,696
- here now, right now.
- Yes, ma'am.

128
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,983
What's
the situation, Captain?

129
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,467
Armed mercs stormed
my precinct,

130
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,719
took a dozen
of my guys hostage.

131
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,264
How did they get
by your men?

132
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,641
It's a long story that
I don't have time to tell.

133
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,977
The only demand was to
speak to the mayor.

134
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,623
All right. Well, I'll
go talk to them.

135
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,500
I appreciate that,
but there is no way

136
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,648
I'm sending you in there.

137
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,358
Listen. I wore the blues
a long time

138
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,877
before I wore
this monkey suit, okay?

139
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,486
- I can hold my own.
- I know, sir.

140
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:01,821
It's not the point.

141
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,239
She's right.
It's too risky.

142
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,908
Says the man who risks
his life every day for this city?

143
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,704
Give me a vest.
I'll go in there,

144
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,014
I'll distract
the son of a bitch,

145
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,683
and in the meantime,
you sneak around the back

146
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:13,749
and do your thing, okay?

147
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,002
The longer
this drags on,

148
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,587
the worse it gets.

149
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:19,755
Let me do this.

150
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,091
I'll have his back.

151
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,721
I want you on comms
the whole time.

152
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,930
Sure.

153
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,909
<i>All units,
be advised</i>

154
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,327
<i>Mayor Lance is entering
the building.</i>

155
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,270
<i>I repeat Mayor Lance is
entering the building.</i>

156
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,817
This is Mayor
Quentin Lance.

157
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,444
I'm unarmed.
I'm coming in.

158
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,866
- That's far enough.
- All right.

159
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,659
Just... just take
it easy, okay?

160
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,161
Take it easy.

161
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,870
<i>I'm in position. Keep him talking.</i>

162
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,584
You asked for me.
Here I am.

163
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:58,854
What do you want to
talk about with me?

164
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,038
You're the Mayor.
You're a guy

165
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,255
who can make things
happen.

166
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,716
Why don't you let a few
of these guys go while we talk?

167
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,343
So I can get stormed
by the cops?

168
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,094
No, thanks.
I'm not stupid.

169
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,501
But it would show that
you don't want anybody to get hurt

170
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,848
because if anybody gets hurt,

171
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,058
you're in real trouble.

172
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,061
Actually, I think
you're already in trouble.

173
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,562
I'm the one holding the gun.

174
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,648
Not for long.
Put it down.

175
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,691
Agh. Err.

176
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,403
This... is... over.

177
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,656
This isn't over
until you stop it, Oliver.

178
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,199
That's the only
way out.

179
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:29,784
What are you
talking about?

180
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,495
- No!
- Quentin!

181
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,499
Ahh!

182
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,292
<i>Tark drives the lane.</i>

183
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,252
<i>Kicks it to Aldrich
in the corner for three.</i>

184
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,506
<i>Bingo! Count it and the foul.</i>

185
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,052
<i>That's an 8-0 run
by the Comets,</i>

186
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,804
<i>who have stormed
all the way back</i>

187
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,681
<i>to tie it up
in the fourth quarter.</i>

188
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,020
<i>88 apiece. What a comeback
for the Comets,</i>

189
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,647
<i>and there's a timeout...</i>

190
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,191
No way.
It tastes the same.

191
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,378
I'm telling you
this Big Belly Burger's just better.

192
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,522
I think
he's right.

193
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,988
This is pre-Gwespin
Foods merger.

194
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,453
Ooh, Dad. What are you
still doing here?

195
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,415
I'm late
for a fundraiser.

196
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,916
Yeah. Really late.

197
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,899
You want a burger?
Those things never have good food.

198
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,302
Did something happen
at the SCPD headquarters?

199
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,054
Like what?

200
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,223
Never mind.

201
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,375
Hey, Queen.
What's the difference

202
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,109
between a cop
and the Green Arrow?

203
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,820
Cop doesn't need
to play dress-up to do his job.

204
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,658
- Ooh! Nice reflexes, Mr. Queen.
- Thank you.

205
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,787
There you are. You know
the party started an hour ago, right?

206
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,247
I need to speak
with you.

207
00:08:58,414 --> 00:08:59,832
Uh, this is gonna
sound crazy.

208
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,586
Um... I have been
here before. So have you.

209
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,168
What are you
talking about?

210
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,024
About the Monitor dropping
me into some sort of

211
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,842
alternate reality
t-time loop or something,

212
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,279
where everything is different,
where Lance is still alive.

213
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,805
Oliver, Lance has
always been alive.

214
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,141
No, he hasn't.
You just don't remember

215
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,668
because the Monitor has done
something to people's memories,

216
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,447
but I... I think I know
the way out of this,

217
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:24,982
but I... I need to stop
a bomb at the SCPD.

218
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,234
Oliver, will you just
calm down, man?

219
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,653
If there was a bomb,
we would know about it.

220
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,113
Lyla would know
about it.

221
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,364
Lyla's a part of this.

222
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,532
Part of what?

223
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,385
Oliver seems to
think that he's caught

224
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,410
in some sort
of time loop.

225
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:37,846
If we're traveling
back in time,

226
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,080
I'd like to revisit
my 20s.

227
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,664
I... I need to speak
with Quentin.

228
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,875
The mayor's waiting
for me.

229
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,377
Yeah. How'd you know?

230
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,879
Mr. Mayor.

231
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,381
Oh. Hey, Oliver.
Listen.

232
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,343
I, uh... I made a few last-minute
changes to the speech, so...

233
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,137
- We need to talk.
- Sure. Let's.

234
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,265
Uh, yeah. I wanted to run
these changes by you anyway.

235
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,060
You want to add
a joke about Slabside,

236
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,229
about how I would
rather spend time

237
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,815
in a supermax
than take your advice.

238
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,234
You steal a copy
of my speech or something?

239
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,112
We've had this
exact conversation already.

240
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,403
What are you
talking about?

241
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,202
Fully aware of how
this is going to sound.

242
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,666
Quentin, I am trapped
in some sort of... time loop,

243
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,086
where the same events
just keep repeating themselves.

244
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,839
- Like "Groundhog Day."
- Sure,

245
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,633
except this one ends
in a lot of people dead,

246
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,468
including the two of us.

247
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:38,931
Okay. How can I help?

248
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,516
Do you actually
believe me?

249
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,477
Oliver, I've seen
one daughter die

250
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,396
and come back
to life twice.

251
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,323
I've seen another
come from some other Earth.

252
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,568
I've seen a guy in red run
so fast he can reverse time.

253
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,279
This is not exactly
outside the norm, is it?

254
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,282
Also, I'm done learning my lesson
about doubting you

255
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,784
because that always
bites me in the ass. Heh.

256
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,079
What happens now?

257
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,332
Very shortly, we are
gonna learn that

258
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,960
there is a hostage situation
at the SCPD.

259
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:12,423
They're going to insist
that they talk to you and only you.

260
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,757
And how does it
go south?

261
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,218
There's a hidden
explosive device

262
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,554
that I didn't know about
the first time through,

263
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,765
and judging from the blast,
it's underneath the building.

264
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,143
- Eh. So you find it.
- Yeah.

265
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,430
You keep us from going boom.

266
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,188
- What then?
- I break out of the loop.

267
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,522
Great.

268
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,942
Here you are.
There's something you need to see.

269
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,363
Get the feds
on the line.

270
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,250
- Tell them I need backup now.
- Yes, ma'am.

271
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,442
What's the situation,
Captain?

272
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,910
Armed mercs stormed
the precinct,

273
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,316
took a dozen
of my guys hostage.

274
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,666
They have a bomb.

275
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,009
We already did a sweep
of the entire building.

276
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,929
It's not in the building.
It's underneath it.

277
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,923
How could you
possibly know that?

278
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,175
I trust him.
Instinct thing.

279
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,303
So what do you
want to do?

280
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,180
This is
Mayor Quentin Lance.

281
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,516
I'm unarmed.
I'm coming in.

282
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,193
Stop right there.

283
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:21,075
Oh. It's you.
Would you relax?

284
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,077
We are both here
for the same thing.

285
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,995
Hey. How did you know
to come down here?

286
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,331
I may have learned
about the existence

287
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,541
of this place as a part
of a former career.

288
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,657
How did you know
about the bomb?

289
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,545
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

290
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,577
Well, actually, since you're
not going to remember anyway,

291
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:40,427
there is a crazy space god
who has me trapped in a time loop.

292
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,054
Yeah? Me, too.

293
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,765
- It's my second time through.
- Same.

294
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,910
- I wake up in the bunker.
- I wake up in my apartment,

295
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,435
so clearly,
the Monitor is doing this.

296
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,145
- You mean punishing us?
- Yeah.

297
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,733
We are the two people
who have royally pissed him off the most.

298
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,819
In Russia,
I disobeyed him,

299
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,404
and you... you tried to
destroy him.

300
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,090
At least we're in it
together now.

301
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,914
I think disarming that
is the way out of here.

302
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,620
How long do you think
until this thing goes boom?

303
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,370
Oh. Your guess is
as good as mine.

304
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,247
Quentin's upstairs
buying us some time.

305
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,584
- Quentin... he's here?
- Yeah.

306
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,005
I think we just activated
some kind of failsafe.

307
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,774
Look. We need more
time on the next loop, Laurel.

308
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,567
It would probably help
if we found each other faster next time.

309
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,735
There's a party
at the Palmer Tech building.

310
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,320
- Meet me there.
- Are we talking formal wear or...

311
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,543
<i>Tark drives the lane.</i>

312
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,766
<i>Kicks it to Aldrich
in the corner for three.</i>

313
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:28,934
<i>Bingo!</i>

314
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,061
No way.
It's the same.

315
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,206
I'm telling you.
This Big Belly Burger is just better.

316
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,416
Guess you realized
you're late.

317
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,441
Something like that.

318
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,296
Hey, Queen.
What's the difference

319
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,463
between a cop
and the Green Arrow?

320
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,299
Cop doesn't need to play
dress-up to do his job.

321
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,324
Sorry.

322
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,702
Mr. Mayor?

323
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,457
Hey, Oliver. Listen. I made a few
last-minute changes to the speech.

324
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,976
And you figured you should
run them by me first.

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,043
Yeah, exactly.

326
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:56,587
Hey, baby girl.

327
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,049
I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

328
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:01,800
Me either.

329
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,011
You okay, honey?

330
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,058
I'm just really
happy to see you.

331
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,393
Oh. I'm happy
to see you, too.

332
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,955
Though I got to say
I'm glad you left

333
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,339
the black lipstick
at home tonight.

334
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,899
You know that I'm
Earth-2 Laurel.

335
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,192
Who else would
you be?

336
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,759
Look. I'm really sorry
to interrupt,

337
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,195
but you and I
need to go.

338
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,128
You're coming with us.
We need your help.

339
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,150
What do you mean
there's a bomb?

340
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,348
I know how to stop it,
but you have to trust me.

341
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:32,414
I'm gonna need
a vest.

342
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,832
Not this time,
Quentin.

343
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,751
This is
Mayor Quentin Lance.

344
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,088
You wanted to talk.
Let's talk.

345
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,759
The detonator operates
on an oscillating frequency.

346
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,366
If we can find the right one,
we should be able to disrupt it.

347
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,276
<i>Vincent, listen to me.</i>

348
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,700
<i>I know you don't
really want to do this.</i>

349
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,327
And I know that
if you don't get in here

350
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,936
these men are
gonna die.

351
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,021
I have an idea.

352
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,483
We did it.

353
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,028
Okay. Fine. You did it.

354
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,133
We stopped the bomb.
What the hell are we still doing here?

355
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,283
I don't... I...

356
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,285
we must have
missed something.

357
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,039
No!

358
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,834
No! No!

359
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,338
<i>Tark drives the lane.</i>

360
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,225
<i>Kicks it to Aldrich
in the corner for three.</i>

361
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,383
<i>Bingo!</i>

362
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,764
Lovely to have you
here this evening.

363
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,558
Thanks for coming out.

364
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,106
All right. Quentin's death
is the reset point,

365
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,315
which means that

366
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,734
saving him must
be the key.

367
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,910
What kind of sick game
is the Monitor playing?

368
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,488
I don't know.
We need to find out

369
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,449
who is behind this
hostage situation.

370
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,160
If it's just about killing Quentin,
then why plant a bomb?

371
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,870
It seems like a lot
of extra work.

372
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,413
Maybe whoever is
behind this wants

373
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,831
their involvement
kept a secret.

374
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,333
Do you really think
there's a larger conspiracy here?

375
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,960
Those were
mercenaries, Laurel,

376
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,962
which means that
somebody had to hire them.

377
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,132
Great, and I'm sure they're
gonna be really easy to find, too.

378
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,509
Any idea
where to start?

379
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,447
Let's get Quentin
out of here.

380
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,911
Why don't you take
him to the bunker?

381
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,515
What about you?

382
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,311
I'm gonna go take
a look at that bomb.

383
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,151
Laurel, I didn't think
you'd make it tonight.

384
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,196
I am really not
in the mood for small talk

385
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,405
with the Monitor's
bestie.

386
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,407
- Excuse me.
- It turns out tranq darts,

387
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,867
they don't
feel so good.

388
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,661
I told you that was
a big misunderstanding.

389
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,164
Well, understand this.
The second I get out

390
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,458
of this sadistic
"Edge of Tomorrow" reboot,

391
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,019
I am going to make sure
to tell everyone

392
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,504
exactly what kind
of traitor you really are.

393
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,298
Laurel, I truly have
no idea what you're talking about,

394
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,383
but whatever it is
you're feeling toward me,

395
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,551
that's on you.

396
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,137
Thank you for
the advice, Dr. Phil,

397
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,139
and now here's
some for you.

398
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,226
The next time you decide to
double-cross someone,

399
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,769
don't pick a woman
who specializes in revenge.

400
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,355
You're threatening me.

401
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,942
Yes. Yes, I am,
but don't worry.

402
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,235
You won't remember
anyway,

403
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,030
and by the way, I pull off
the short hair way better than you do.

404
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,580
What are you
doing here?

405
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:23,835
Well, word came down that
the Green Arrow called in a bomb threat,

406
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,506
so I thought to myself,
"How did he know about that,

407
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:28,713
and why didn't
he call me?"

408
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
Because the Monitor
has me trapped in a time loop.

409
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,470
Already told you that.

410
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,931
Okay. Definitely not
the answer I was expecting,

411
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,559
but if the Monitor's involved,
anything is possible.

412
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,977
Any idea
how to break out?

413
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,145
I have to save
Quentin's life.

414
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,690
I thought that this
was the key to it,

415
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,233
but I'm not finding
anything.

416
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,652
Well, has to be something.
No case is unsolvable.

417
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,070
This might be impossible.

418
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,319
Well, you'll
figure it out.

419
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,949
I do wish I was
as sure as you are.

420
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,719
You want to know what
makes me so sure?

421
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,785
- Huh?
- You.

422
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,580
You, Oliver.
You always figure it out.

423
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,915
You never stop fighting.
You never give up.

424
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,208
You always keep at it.

425
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,252
Why should this be
any different?

426
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,920
Whatever version
this is of you,

427
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,840
you still give
the best advice.

428
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,184
- Yeah. I'm flattered.
- Well, A.R.G.U.S. has

429
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,678
some more sophisticated
analytical equipment.

430
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,431
Any chance you can
get me in there?

431
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,934
Yeah. I bet I can make
a few calls.

432
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,648
So you're telling me we're in
some kind of a alternate reality

433
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,984
based on the plot
of a Bill Murray movie?

434
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,362
Well, I was gonna go with
a Tom Cruise flick but basically.

435
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,907
Also just really glad
that you believe me.

436
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,177
Well, it's not the craziest thing
you ever told me.

437
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,681
I mean, I'm just
glad this Monitor guy

438
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:40,985
just kept me
as mayor, you know?

439
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,752
What is it?
What's that look?

440
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,340
It... it's just that, uh,
in my world

441
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:56,094
or in the real world, uh,
you're not mayor anymore.

442
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,097
Really?
Pollard.

443
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,224
She always had it in for me.

444
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,146
There something else?

445
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,025
Laurel. Sweetheart,
I always know when you're

446
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,193
hiding something
from me.

447
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,486
Please tell me.
What is it?

448
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,446
It... it's a year
and a half ago

449
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,615
when Diaz...
when he shot you

450
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,242
in... in the real reality
or whatever,

451
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,495
you... you didn't
exactly, um...

452
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,626
I didn't recover.

453
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:31,922
No. No. You died
to save me.

454
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,594
Best way I could
have gone.

455
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,223
What?! I'm sorry.
I basically just

456
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,351
told you you're a ghost,
and you're completely okay with that?

457
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,812
It doesn't... it doesn't faze you?
You're completely calm?

458
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,231
I always felt like
I cheated death with that one.

459
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,192
Guess that's
because I didn't.

460
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,697
Fate's just tricky
like that.

461
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,039
- It's Oliver.
- Yeah?

462
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,166
He figure out who
wants me dead?

463
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,877
Not yet, but he did
figure out the location

464
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,045
of the mercs' hideout.

465
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,339
Okay. So we better go.

466
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,728
How'd you find
this place?

467
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,896
Uh, we analyzed
the bomb

468
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,649
and traced the chemical signature
back to this building.

469
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,109
Interesting.

470
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,028
- What?
- Your mouth

471
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,238
but Felicity's words.

472
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,032
It still doesn't tell us
who hired these bozos.

473
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,201
Maybe this will help.

474
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,800
Bomb!

475
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,362
Uh, w-what the hell
are you doing?

476
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,615
Helping you. You're missing
the point, Oliver.

477
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,492
- What?
- You can't fight this.

478
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,119
Ugh.

479
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,206
Lyla!

480
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,258
<i>Tark drives the lane.</i>

481
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,145
<i>Kicks it to Aldrich
in the corner for three.</i>

482
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,430
<i>Bingo! Count it and the foul.</i>

483
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,561
No sign of Lyla
anywhere. You?

484
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,664
John just told me
she got called away

485
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,999
on a last-minute
A.R.G.U.S. mission,

486
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,192
meaning she's never
even been here.

487
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,070
Maybe the Monitor deleted
her for going rogue.

488
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,920
Wouldn't that be so, so sad?

489
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,987
She's clearly helping him.
There's no reason for her

490
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,158
to switch sides right now.

491
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,327
So why reveal her hand?
It makes no sense.

492
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,662
All right.
You spoke with her.

493
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,455
Was there anything,

494
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,622
anything at all in
the conversation that stood out?

495
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,086
She said how I feel
towards her was on me.

496
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,588
Like it's my fault that
I'm stuck here.

497
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,551
I told you the Monitor's
punishing us.

498
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:24,845
I'm not so sure.

499
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,889
We've had to watch
Quentin die over and over again,

500
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,516
and we can't save him.

501
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,686
If I had to design hell,
this would be it.

502
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,688
But right before
Lyla disappeared,

503
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,566
she told me she was
trying to help me.

504
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,318
She also told you
you can't fight this.

505
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,947
It seems pretty clear to me
that we're not supposed to win.

506
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,949
The first time
that I met Mar Novu,

507
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,952
it felt... it felt
the same.

508
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,556
It was like I was put in a situation
where there was no way out,

509
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,164
but it was a test,
Laurel.

510
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,792
It was a test
just like I think that this is.

511
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,627
- A test of what?
- I don't know,

512
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,504
but there is
a way out of here,

513
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,256
and I'm gonna find it.

514
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,511
- You just never give up, do you?
- No, I don't.

515
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,218
Are you with me?

516
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,971
Fine.

517
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,265
What's our play?

518
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,130
We go back
to the mercs' hideout.

519
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,704
We know where the danger
is this time,

520
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,187
so we can do things
differently.

521
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,704
You grab Quentin,
and I'll meet you there.

522
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:21,860
Okay.

523
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,548
So you're telling
me we've been here once

524
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,115
and still came back
for more?

525
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,826
At least now we know
what not to do.

526
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,077
Okay.

527
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,131
All right. That should
disable the bomb.

528
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,098
Well, I certainly hope so
because I am getting

529
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,010
sick and tired
of getting blown up.

530
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,032
- All right.
- Okay. So now what?

531
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,392
We find out who hired
those mercs to kill you.

532
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,980
Money leads to a man
named Anderson White.

533
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,315
Never heard of him.

534
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,834
Looks like he's
been accused

535
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,026
of not too many
nice things...

536
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,779
money laundering,
racketeering.

537
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,031
Doesn't explain why
he'd want me dead.

538
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,718
Well, that's what we're
gonna find out.

539
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,911
CEO of a company
named Global Solutions.

540
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,555
They have a warehouse
down by the docks.

541
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:15,580
Let's go.

542
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,045
We need to find White.

543
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,223
Back this way!

544
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,499
- Come on, come on.
- I got you. I got you.

545
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,648
I'll take care
of the rest.

546
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,111
Err! Ugh.

547
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,654
Oh, I'm sorry, baby girl.

548
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,614
Looks like we lost
this round.

549
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:53,743
No. No! I am not
letting you die again.

550
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,664
- It's too late.
- No.

551
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,499
It... it's... it's time
to say good-bye.

552
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,086
I'm not giving up
on you, Quentin.

553
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,171
Quentin, I am not
giving up on you.

554
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,215
You never gave up
on me.

555
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,844
You believed in me
when nobody else did.

556
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,723
Well, that's what
dads do. They believe.

557
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,641
I want you to know

558
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,185
that you are the reason
that I'm trying to be a hero.

559
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:21,688
It's because of you.

560
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:27,902
Sweetheart...
you are a hero.

561
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:29,696
You are.

562
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,033
Thank you.

563
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,119
Thank you. I never
had the chance to tell you

564
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,871
how much you
mean to me.

565
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,375
- Well...
- Thank you.

566
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,252
I think you just did.

567
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,966
I love you. I love you.

568
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,901
Good-bye.

569
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,694
Damn it.

570
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,990
All right. Okay.
All right, Laurel.

571
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,201
We fix this next time.
We'll fix it.

572
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,248
I can't do this again.

573
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,250
I'm done, Oliver.

574
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,378
All I have ever wanted
was a chance

575
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:28,880
to say good-bye
to Quentin.

576
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,094
Now I have.

577
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,431
<i>Tark drives the lane.</i>

578
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,642
<i>Kicks it to Aldrich
in the corner for three.</i>

579
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,395
<i>Bingo! Count it and the foul.</i>

580
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,649
Laurel?

581
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,361
Laurel!

582
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,496
She's not here.

583
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,208
- Where is she?
- Gone.

584
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,210
What did you... what
did you do, Lyla?

585
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,796
I didn't do anything.
Laurel got what she needed from this.

586
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,482
I don't have time
for these games, Lyla,

587
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,300
so whatever this is,
get me out of here right now!

588
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,510
I can't do that,
Oliver.

589
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,345
Mar Novu needs you
to understand

590
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,180
no good will come
from struggle.

591
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,100
The only way to win
is to accept the inevitable.

592
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,227
I have no idea
what that means.

593
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,813
Learn that,
and this will end.

594
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,609
Lyla!

595
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,866
So if me dying
is the problem,

596
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,160
maybe bringing me
into the lion's den isn't so smart.

597
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,206
Couldn't think of a better
way to keep you safe.

598
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,454
Yeah.
That makes sense.

599
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:44,956
Huh!

600
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,460
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Unless you want a hole for a head.

601
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,045
Are you
Anderson White?

602
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,438
You really think
Mr. White would be here?

603
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,425
He ordered a hit
on my friend. Why?

604
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,701
I guess
the clock's ticking.

605
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,644
Looks like a list
of hits.

606
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,521
And clients.
Coded and anonymous.

607
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,023
White's just
the middleman.

608
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,025
A CEO with a healthy
side business brokering

609
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,610
hits for wealthy asshats.

610
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,087
All right. We're back
to square one.

611
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,951
We have no idea how deep
this rabbit hole goes.

612
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:18,114
We got to get going.

613
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,457
Unh!

614
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:44,933
Get down! Get down!

615
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,396
Hey. You okay?
You all right? Okay.

616
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,732
Come on. Come on.

617
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,861
Come on.

618
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,739
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

619
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,324
Whoa!

620
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,038
Go, go, go,
go, go, go!

621
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,500
Aah!

622
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,919
- Get them.
- Go, go, go.

623
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,149
Let's go.
Come on.

624
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,985
Get down, get down!

625
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,371
Over there!

626
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,581
Down, Quentin!

627
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:58,089
Ohh. Oh, it's
the last one.

628
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,383
How many arrows
you got left?

629
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,512
Not enough.

630
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,472
Oh, boy. Aren't we
the couple?

631
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,142
We are gonna find
a way out of this.

632
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,977
There has to be
a way to fix it,

633
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,589
and we are gonna
find it, Quentin.

634
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,456
It doesn't matter how many times.
We're gonna find it!

635
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,649
Yeah? Sure.
What's it gonna be,

636
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,443
60 times, 100 times?

637
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,445
It's gonna be however
many times it takes!

638
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,950
You know, getting
hunted like this

639
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,287
in a space like this
is kind of like

640
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,289
what I was doing to you
all those years ago.

641
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:32,623
Remember?

642
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,591
Sort of makes sense I'd go out
like this now, don't you think?

643
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,358
Would you please just
save your strength?

644
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,220
For what?

645
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,599
Oliver, you take care
of these guys,

646
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:50,886
there'll be more
behind them,

647
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,119
there will be more
behind them.

648
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,978
There is no saving me
from this!

649
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,024
Okay? You ever think
that's the point?

650
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,777
Maybe you're not
supposed to.

651
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,322
I'm not giving up...

652
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,326
and you're not
giving up either.

653
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,828
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not giving up.

654
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,748
Maybe I'm giving in.

655
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,627
You see, I've been
outrunning death for a while now.

656
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:21,172
The siege, the island,

657
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,300
but when Diaz shot me,
that felt different

658
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,346
like I was finally
at the end,

659
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,141
and I made my peace
with that.

660
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,899
And maybe it's time
you did, too.

661
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,786
It looks like fate's
knocking.

662
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,706
You just get ready
to move.

663
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,950
I'll see you
on the other side, Oliver.

664
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:18,729
Quentin.

665
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,033
<i>Tark drives the lane.</i>

666
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,202
<i>Kicks it to Aldrich
in the corner for three.</i>

667
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:36,414
<i>Bingo! Count it and the foul.</i>

668
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,417
<i>That's an 8-0 run
by the Comets,</i>

669
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:41,627
<i>who have stormed all the way
back to tie it up here</i>

670
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:42,795
<i>in the fourth quarter.</i>

671
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,172
<i>88 apiece.</i>

672
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,882
<i>What a comeback for the Comets,</i>

673
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,049
<i>and there's a timeout.</i>

674
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,699
No way.
It tastes the same.

675
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,203
Dad, what are you
still doing here?

676
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,414
Hey, guys.
I'm just heading out the door.

677
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,002
Wanted to let you know,
all of you know

678
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:27,048
what a... just what a gift

679
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,176
getting to know
you all has been.

680
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,929
Dad, you're going
to a fundraiser.

681
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,781
It's not like you're
going into war.

682
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,309
Although I guess I can
see the similarities.

683
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,853
I think he's talking
about Crisis.

684
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:47,109
I'm just really
proud of all you guys.

685
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:49,570
I'm really proud.

686
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:52,698
I got to go.

687
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:55,701
Dad...

688
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,624
you're gonna be fine.

689
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,543
So are you.

690
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:05,878
All of you will be

691
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,006
whatever happens.

692
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,824
Hey, Queen.
What's the difference

693
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,517
between a cop... hey!

694
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,234
Yeah. Lovely.

695
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,569
Quentin, excuse me.

696
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,487
Hey.

697
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:32,822
What's the matter,
Oliver?

698
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,532
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

699
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:35,908
Maybe I did.

700
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:38,953
May I speak with you
for a second?

701
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,329
Sure.

702
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,749
Uh, yeah, you want to
go over the speech?

703
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,586
'Cause I was thinking
about adding a few lines.

704
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,673
I have a question for you.

705
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,008
Sure.

706
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,386
Back when I was
running around as the Hood,

707
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:57,757
you were trying to
arrest me.

708
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,473
You remember that?

709
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,976
Ah. Yeah. The good old days.

710
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,603
How could I ever forget?

711
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,479
The question is...

712
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,818
what made you decide
that I wasn't

713
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,653
your enemy anymore?

714
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:14,905
What changed
your mind?

715
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:21,037
Huh. Oh, you know,
my daughters for one.

716
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:22,946
Because I didn't
raise dummies,

717
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,349
and, uh, you know, if
they were okay with you,

718
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,751
then I figured
I should be, too.

719
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:31,005
- Yeah.
- They trusted me,

720
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:33,424
and you trusted them.

721
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,193
Yeah. They got me to listen
to what I always knew

722
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,178
in my gut, that we were
on the same side

723
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,055
and fighting
for the same goal,

724
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:42,642
and it just took me
a while to get there.

725
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,809
Sorry.

726
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:45,519
It's okay.

727
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,209
Oliver, is there
any particular reason

728
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,482
for this trip
down memory lane?

729
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:51,442
Yeah.

730
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,323
God, I've been
hanging on to something.

731
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:02,495
Someone told me
just recently that, uh...

732
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,998
it's about time
I made peace with it.

733
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,338
Okay. Sounds like
a smart someone.

734
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:17,635
Yeah.

735
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,558
Oh, I shouldn't have
to say good-bye to you again.

736
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,352
Good-bye?

737
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,106
Evening's just
getting started.

738
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:32,483
Yeah.

739
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:39,365
Thank you, Quentin
for everything.

740
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,243
Mr. Mayor.

741
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,328
We're gonna see
each other again, Oliver.

742
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:45,496
Mr. Mayor!

743
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,873
Hostage situation.

744
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,503
I hope so.

745
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,114
Congratulations, Oliver.

746
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,324
Now you understand.

747
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,955
I couldn't change
Quentin's fate.

748
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,418
I can't change
mine either, can I?

749
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,755
No. I'm sorry.

750
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:42,219
Why did the Monitor go to all
of this trouble just to...

751
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,514
just to prove a point?

752
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,161
You've always been
a man who needed to

753
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,601
see things for himself.

754
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,082
Telling you wouldn't
have been enough.

755
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,064
How long have you
worked for him?

756
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:55,733
A while.

757
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,360
You lied to us, Lyla.

758
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,820
You...

759
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,365
you lied to John.

760
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,732
Keeping this
from John has been

761
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,303
the hardest thing I've
ever had to do.

762
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,328
Then why do it?

763
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:10,039
The same reason you left
Felicity and Mia

764
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:13,083
in that cabin...
to protect my family.

765
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,211
Do you honestly
believe that working

766
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,088
with the Monitor
is the best way to do that?

767
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,507
It's the only way.

768
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:22,468
The Crisis is coming.
There is no stopping it.

769
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:24,720
All we can do is
try to survive it.

770
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,096
Okay, help me out
here, Lyla.

771
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,808
I don't even know
what it is.

772
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,937
I know,
but you will... soon.

773
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,564
What I can tell you

774
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,525
is there is an evil coming
that is greater

775
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,610
than anything we've
ever had to face.

776
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:45,866
Can we stop it?

777
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:47,618
I don't know...

778
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,372
but you are the only
chance we have.

779
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,502
So everything I've done

780
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,463
from the moment
I left that cabin,

781
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:02,508
this has all been some...

782
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,427
bigger part of a test?

783
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,763
He needed to be sure
you were ready.

784
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,641
He's just been sending
me on useless missions.

785
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,184
They weren't useless.

786
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,520
The dwarf star particles,
Dr. Wong,

787
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:16,397
even the antimatter
weapon,

788
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:17,982
they all have a purpose,

789
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,276
just not the one
you were expecting.

790
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,784
Why did he involve
my children?

791
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,494
Time is a gift.

792
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:37,793
What now?

793
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,045
You complete
your final mission.

794
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:44,675
I'll see you there.

795
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,650
Ohh.

796
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:04,570
Where are we?

797
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:07,948
You okay?

798
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,076
I have
a killer headache.

799
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:14,705
The last thing that
I remember is Quentin...

800
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,499
dying in
that warehouse.

801
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:20,544
I was wearing these
on the roof

802
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:22,922
when we got tranqed,
so does that mean that...

803
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,050
We got out.

804
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:27,885
How?

805
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,596
We learned our lessons.

806
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,599
I got out
after I said good-bye.

807
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,635
Why would the Monitor
let me see Quentin one last time?

808
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:41,065
It was a reward
for not betraying me.

809
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:44,193
Didn't really think
rewards were his brand.

810
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,655
No. We were wrong
about him.

811
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,907
And Lyla was right?

812
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,785
That's annoying.

813
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,788
So why did you
have to learn to let Lance go?

814
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,084
Because deep down,
I still believed

815
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,252
that I could fight
my fate.

816
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,633
Now I know I can't.

817
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,683
Lyla said we had
one last thing to do,

818
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,560
one final mission.

819
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,271
I can't wait to find out
what that is.

820
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,400
Where that is.

821
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,987
We're not
in Star City.

822
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:32,533
Dad.

823
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:36,662
You okay?

824
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,288
Where the hell are we?

825
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:43,961
We're on Lian Yu.

826
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,877
Greg, move your head!
