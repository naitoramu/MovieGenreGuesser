You heard him, no?

That guy is the law. Like John Wayne.

192

The Governor took three medical courses
in the army.

He's gonna help with the operation.

197

I didn't finish my studies,

Death can be the greatest opportunity
of your life, Sergio.

609
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,290
You're sad, Professor?

610
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,410
If you want,
you can talk to me about feelings.

611
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,120
Do you want to listen to some music?
Music tends to cheer people up.

This is a stolen car.
This music is not mine!

Why do you care who the blood's for?

620
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,120
I saw two people going upstairs
with the teddy bear,

621
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,520
but there's only one of them now.

622
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,540
Well, now you know who it's for.

So let's stay quiet.

624

- Denver.
- What?

625
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Thanks, man.

626
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,950
- For what?
- I wanted to get in here

627
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,700
so I could talk to you in person.

628
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,700
I know we didn't exactly start off
on the right foot,

629
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,200
but at the end of the day,
the only thing that's important

630
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,870
is that you raise my son.

631
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,580
- Thank you.
- What are you doing, you moron?

632
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,200
It's fine, Paquita. That's enough.
That's enough. Thank you.

I’m pretty sure changing shitty diapers

636
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,320
That’s why you've got my respect.

637

She was so close.

I don't know.
I guess I didn't read the signs right.

675
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:52,500
She told me that we would meet somewhere
after this so I could see my son.

676
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,330
One thing led to another, and I jumped.

You jumped?

678
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,290

Just let it go. Let it go.

You were gonna meet this piece of shit
to show him our son?

He was emotional.

Pamuk.

What?

00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,120
My dog's name was Pamuk.

743
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,120
It was with me during the whole war.

744

I know what you feel.

745
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,660
Marseille, are you trying to create
a metaphor

746
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,200
or something between your dead dog
and my wife?

She was a female dog.

748
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,160
After the war,
all of my friends were dead.

749
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,450
And I...

750
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,580
spent my nights in a bar.

751
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,120
One day, another day.

752
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,910
Pamuk was always outside waiting. Always.

753
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,450
So you two were also in love,
and was she executed in front of you?

754
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes.

755
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,200
What happened to Pamuk?

756
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,790
The boys from the village...

757
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,450
liked to play war.

758
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,450
So after a while,

759
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,830

they got all bored of playing war.

760
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,370
One day,

761
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,620
they found some rocks.

762
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,290
They broke bottles...

763
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,370
and said my Pamuk

764
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,160
was the enemy.

765
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,910
I'm sorry.

766
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,950
She was a good dog.

767
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,080
Marseille, can you stop for a moment?
I need to... urinate.

There's been an increase

coming in and out of the bank.

Martínez, in clear terms, please.

790
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,250
They're communicating
with someone outside.

Okay. We need to remove

797
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,200
From the bandwidth,
it looks like a video call.

<font color="#138ce9">TAMAYO:</font> Can we see it?

The signal is encrypted.

800
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,000
I'd say
it’s going through a Kazakh satellite.

801
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,910
And from there, probably through
the deep web, but I'm not sure.

So let's take it down.

Colonel...

807
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,260
If the satellite belonged
to a phone company in Spain,

808
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,930
- we'd have to request a temporary jam...
- I don't need you to tell me

what we can't do.

We'd have to jam every signal in the area,

take down the Internet and anything
going through satellites.
