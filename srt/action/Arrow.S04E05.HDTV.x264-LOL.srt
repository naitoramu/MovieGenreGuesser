1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,732
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:04,015
I'm going to run for mayor.

3
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:06,348
Mr. Palmer's last
recorded statement

4
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:07,814
could shed some light
on how he died.

5
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:09,049
Ahh!

6
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,751
What's happening to me?

7
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:11,885
We're going
to Nanda Parbat.

8
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,086
You need to feed this impulse.

9
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,721
Once you do, it will
subside for a time.

10
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,189
I want you
to bring my sister back to life.

11
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,724
Even if Sara
went into the Pit,

12
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,159
what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.

13
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:20,360
Your daughter is alive.

14
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:21,762
The most loving act
you can commit

15
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:23,730
is to return Sara
to her final rest.

16
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,966
You are not going
to kill your own daughter.

17
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:26,967
She's not my daughter!

18
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,069
Sara?

19
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,446
Ohh, damn it!

20
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,081
Hey, honey.

21
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,350
Why don't you just
leave that right there?

22
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,361
Get off, bitch.

23
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:01,768
Oh, my God, thank you!

24
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:06,773
Hal Ha-tha An-tea?

25
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,409
SCPD! Stay where you are.

26
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:13,942

Original Air Date on November 4, 2015

28
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,924
I cannot thank you enough
for coming on board, Alex.

29
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:27,194
Well, then it is a good thing
you're paying me, also.

30
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:28,628
Sorry for the wait.

31
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,163
Ollie, this is Alex Davis,

32
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,999
the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

33
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,901
Old enough
to vote, Alex?

34
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:37,204
I owned a bar and I wasn't
even old enough to drink.

35
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:38,872
I am old enough
to do both.

36
00:01:38,874 --> 00:01:41,041
Well, I'm glad that
you're joining the team,

37
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:45,078
but I don't entirely know why I need
a political strategist.

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,981
Well... I guess
the question then is,

39
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,984
do you want to take office with
ten percent of the vote or 90?

40
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,719
After you win, you still need
to be able to govern.

41
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,187
Well, what
has you concerned?

42
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,123
My lack of experience?
No, we can spin that.

43
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,692
No, I'm talking about the kind
of closet skeletons

44
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:00,827
that could cripple you on
your first day in office.

45
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,463
Your personal
Chappaquiddick.

46
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,365
Wait, like that game
from Harry Potter?

47
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,835
Uh, Chappaquiddick
was a scandal

48
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,637
involving
a can't-lose candidate

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,839
whose campaign fell apart when
he was caught having an affair

50
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,374
after his vehicle
went underwater

51
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,910
and the girl
he was with drowned.

52
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:19,246
Does that sound
at all familiar?

53
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:22,182
Ah, referencing
the "Queen's Gambit" and Sara Lance.

54
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,917
Yeah, got it.

55
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,485
You're about to do
your first on-air sit down, right?

56
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:26,380
Yeah.

57
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:27,255
Bethany Snow?

58
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,956
Ten'll get you twenty,
she brings up Sara and her sister.

59
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,893
Alex, all due respect,
I don't think that people care

60
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:35,195
about my friendship
with Laurel Lance

61
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,264
and an eight-year-old scandal

62
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,733
when the city
is disintegrating

63
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,935
and there are masked
armed men helping it.

64
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:43,904
Not to mention,
there's a woman in Pennytown

65
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:45,639
that's just running
around killing people.

66
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,908
You're right.

67
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,709
I'm sorry.
For a moment,

68
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,012
I forgot how the electorate
always cares about the issues

69
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:54,114
and has zero appetite
for scandal.

70
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,350
You want this city united?

71
00:02:57,352 --> 00:03:00,620
You can't do it as the rich kid playboy
from the tabloids.

72
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:04,224
And like it or not, Laurel Lance
is a constant reminder of that.

73
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,194
So from this day forward,
when anyone brings up Miss Lance,

74
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:09,429
you distance
yourself from her.

75
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,506
Hey, just in time.

76
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,408
I was looking for you.

77
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,318
Why?

78
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:24,606
I want to talk to you
about something you forgot.

79
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:28,748
What's that?

80
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,784
Is that how you want
to play this?

81
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,787
It's fine by me,
pal. Let's go.

82
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:40,193
I don't appreciate
the intrusion, gentlemen.

83
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,028
There's communications
gear in here.

84
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,598
We got ourselves a mole.

85
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,366
You believe
it's Mr. Queen.

86
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:49,636
Look, we've been
on this island eight months

87
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:52,038
without a single problem.
He shows up; Suddenly two guys

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,975
find landmines
and a bunch of drugs go missing.

89
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:56,810
Yeah, Conklin, you got me.

90
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:59,246
I didn't, uh, wash up on shore here after
a boating accident;

91
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:02,684
I parachuted in
on a secret spy mission.

92
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,828
You want to die a liar,
that's fine by me.

93
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:05,606
Man, that's enough.

94
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:08,289
Enough! There are more pressing
matters at hand.

95
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,390
Perhaps if you were focused more
on external threats

96
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:13,493
rather than witch hunts,
you would have caught this man

97
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,195
spying on us
in the fields.

98
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:17,197
Oh, I wasn't spying, mate.

99
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:27,674
Any of you squabblers
got a cigarette?

100
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:30,510
She mumbled something.

101
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:34,281
It sounded, I don't know,
middle eastern?

102
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:36,016
All right, um, I'm going to
have you sit down

103
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:37,651
with a sketch
artist, ok?

104
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,319
Take care of that.

105
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:42,459
Dad.

106
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,324
Hey.

107
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,261
What happened?

108
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:44,992
You tell me.

109
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,893
These two bodies,
dropped by a woman.

110
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,662
Probably the same woman
that's been linked

111
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,821
to the murders of three other skels
in the past few days.

112
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,000
A blonde woman.

113
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,006
Dad, I--

114
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:53,700
I didn't know what
to make of it until tonight,

115
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:55,135
and then this woman
here, she suspects,

116
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:56,937
speaks some kind of
middle eastern language,

117
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,340
just like Sara.
Is she still at your place?

118
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,175
I've been
looking for her.

119
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,261
Why didn't you tell me,
huh?! You tell Queen?

120
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,262
No!

121
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:07,714
Because he would just see this
the same way as you.

122
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:09,582
Oh, yeah, and how is
that, huh? How is that?!

123
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,218
That Sara is
just... a thing

124
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,187
that needs
to be stopped.

125
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,388
This is my daughter.

126
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,856
Then why
did I find you

127
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,558
with a gun
pointed at her head?

128
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,293
I'm not proud
of that, Laurel.

129
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:21,594
But people are dying.

130
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:24,230
And if I pulled
that trigger,

131
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:26,199
maybe they wouldn't be.

132
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,901
I'm going to go find
Sara, and hopefully

133
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,769
I do before
you or Oliver.

134
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,509
Curtis, I need you
to do something for me.

135
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:37,844
Felicity,
look at me.

136
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,746
Gym clothes, gym bag--
do either of those

137
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:41,614
suggest
anything to you?

138
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:44,651
Physical fitness, but then
I remembered you're a tech guy.

139
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,386
I'm also a bronze
metal decathlete.

140
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,387
Bronze medal, huh?

141
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,588
Beijing, 2008.

142
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,291
Beijing, as in the Olympics?

143
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,262
Mr. Palmer's recording.
Did you play it?

144
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:58,431
Yes. There's something
off about it.

145
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:01,267
You sure it's not the fact that
it's a dying declaration from your ex?

146
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:05,405
I mean, that is some serious
Nicholas Sparks-level stuff.

147
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,308
Don't judge. The man
can write emotion.

148
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,743
No, not that.
I mean, yes, there's that,

149
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,344
but there's still some
artifacts playing

150
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:12,912
that shouldn't
be there.

151
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,217
What about your work-out?

152
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:20,153
Didn't seem to concern you
20 seconds ago.

153
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,725
Ray, on recording:
I'm sorry, Felicity, this is my fault.

154
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,595
You hear that?

155
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,763
Like there's more
to the recording.

156
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,131
Something
overlapping with it.

157
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,999
I was hoping you could
clean it up for me.

158
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,467
I mean,
after your workout.

159
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,536
It can wait. I'm glad you
changed your mind

160
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:38,605
about hearing
Mr. Palmer's final words.

161
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,840
Thank you, Curtis.

162
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:45,412
Ah, thank you for coming.

163
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:47,414
I think we both know
I didn't have too much choice.

164
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,049
No. Well,
certainly not since

165
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,350
you literally doubled the number
of daughters

166
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,484
I have
to hold over you.

167
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:52,786
Or did you
take my advice

168
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,288
and return Sara
to the grave?

169
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,023
You didn't take
my advice. Pity.

170
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,324
What do you want?!

171
00:06:58,326 --> 00:06:59,793
Oh, a new beginning
for the world,

172
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,094
a nice glass
of Merlot--

173
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,362
not necessarily
in that order.

174
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:04,597
Oh!

175
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,001
And for you
to do me a favor.

176
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:10,970
There's a federal server farm
30 miles outside of the city.

177
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,052
I want you to gain access and plug
this little baby into one of the computers.

178
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,977
And what's this
thing going to do?

179
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,345
Oh, it's of
no concern of yours.

180
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:20,880
But don't worry.
It's not like

181
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:23,483
it's going to destroy
the city or anything.

182
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,355
Whatever that spa weekend did
to clear your head,

183
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:32,559
it also improved
your technique.

184
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,794
You're effortless.

185
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:37,831
Yeah, well, you know

186
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,866
how I love my
hot stone massages.

187
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:42,635
By the way, that political strategist
was a good call.

188
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,737
But his advice
was a little harsh.

189
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:47,006
I mean, distancing
yourself from Laurel?

190
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,175
I wasn't expecting that, bu
he made a few good points.

191
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,944
What, like kicking
your friends to the curb?

192
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:53,980
Well, my friendship
with Laurel is... complicated.

193
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:57,150
We have been in each other's
lives for like forever.

194
00:07:57,152 --> 00:08:00,520
I mean, you have been
in love with Laurel and Sara,

195
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,590
and Laurel, she--
she took me in at CNRI

196
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,525
when I was completely lost.

197
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,193
Even Captain Lance, ok,

198
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,863
he has been there for us
since mom died.

199
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,131
Ok, but your point?

200
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,899
My point is that...

201
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:15,502
Pretending that you don't
know who your friends are,

202
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:19,472
it... just doesn't
feel very united.

203
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:22,442
This is your overlord,
Felicity Smoak.

204
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:23,843
We have a P.A. system?

205
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:27,514
Yet another decision I might
live to regret.

206
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,482
Hi, what's going on?

207
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:31,784
Code 47 at
a nightclub on Ninth.

208
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:33,253
A blonde woman
going cray cray.

209
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:35,054
And since
I'm down here,

210
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,290
it's probably the blonde woman
we've been looking for.

211
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,491
The woman who's
killing people in Pennytown.

212
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,659
Suit up.

213
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:40,394
Yeah.

214
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,703
Help! Help!

215
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:55,642
Run!

216
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:58,311
You have got
to stop this!

217
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,887
Sara...

218
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:25,039
Your sister's alive,
she's out there,

219
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,007
and she's hurting people.

220
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,543
How is she alive?

221
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:32,780
The Lazarus Pit?

222
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:35,616
You two spent your spa weekend
at Nanda Parbat?

223
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,519
It was the only place
we could get a reservation.

224
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,388
The blood lust is worse
with Sara, isn't it?

225
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,857
Because you brought
her back from death.

226
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,592
Yeah, and that's not
the only problem.

227
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,128
Sara's not herself.

228
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,662
She's changed.

229
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:49,864
Why didn't you come
to me with this?

230
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,432
Come to you
for what?

231
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:54,068
Your expertise
with magical resurrection?

232
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,636
Or that judgmental
look on your face?

233
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,072
For help finding her, Laurel,
before she gets hurt,

234
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:59,573
or she hurts anyone else.

235
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,575
And if I have a judgmental
look on my face right now,

236
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:04,011
it's because you played with forces
that you do not understand,

237
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:07,548
and now people are dying
because of it.

238
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:10,918
Who's he?

239
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,553
John Constantine.

240
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:15,823
Says so right on the business card
your boss took from me.

241
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,726
He had this on his
person, as well.

242
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:21,695
Do you recognize
these landmarks?

243
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,531
Yeah.

244
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,833
Good.

245
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,702
Whatever it is Mr. Constantine
is looking for,

246
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:30,571
I want you to find it
and bring it back to me.

247
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,406
Oh, come on, I'm telling you,
you can't trust him!

248
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:33,707
Then you can follow him.

249
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:40,414
What are you doing?
Are you actually praying?

250
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,116
No.

251
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:45,019
No, these aren't
prayers, mate.

252
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:52,526
Ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah.

253
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,695
Unless you want
to redecorate

254
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,530
your lovely hut
with his brains,

255
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,399
I suggest you drop
your weapon.

256
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,337
On the floor.

257
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,573
You won't escape
this island.

258
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,575
Ah, I don't intend
on leaving just yet.

259
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:10,144
Come on, you.

260
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:12,393
You really know
the place on that map?

261
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:13,004
Yes.

262
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,034
You do?

263
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:14,508
Yes.

264
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:17,751
Good.

265
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:20,721
You're going to show me.
Now drive!

266
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:28,391
We need to talk.

267
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:29,240
About Sara?

268
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:30,819
Laurel told you?

269
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:32,600
Not exactly.

270
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,435
You got to admire
her consistency.

271
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:37,405
Keeps her death secret from me,
her resurrection secret from you.

272
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,307
Are you ok?
Am I ok?

273
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:41,342
I think there are certain
situations in life

274
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:43,478
where the word
"ok" does not apply.

275
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,246
Well, we're working
on finding Sara.

276
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:48,583
Good. Because we got
other problems.

277
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,251
It's a rat.

278
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,019
A remote access Trojan.
Basically a computer virus.

279
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:55,123
A polymorphic code
designed to target and erase

280
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,591
certain pieces of data.

281
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:58,559
It's buried under
three levels of encryption.

282
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,695
By the time
I've cracked it--

283
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:03,030
Darhk could be wondering
why I haven't run his errand for him.

284
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,332
I'm not sending you
to break into

285
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,334
a federal facility
without back-up.

286
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:07,835
I don't want Laurel knowing
about me and Darhk.

287
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:09,604
I wasn't
suggesting Laurel.

288
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:12,540
Did Oliver tell you that Darhk works
for an organization?

289
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,280
Hive?

290
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:15,510
Yeah.

291
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,211
Hive had my brother killed.

292
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:20,915
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,183
And now, Detective,
you're telling me

294
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,752
that you were
working with them?

295
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,088
For them?

296
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,258
It's a long story.
I've got time.

297
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,693
This city's
been hurting.

298
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:34,562
This is nothing new.

299
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:37,932
Darhk comes to me,
he offers to help fix it.

300
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:40,434
He's got powerful friends,
he's got money--

301
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,670
and this was months
before the Ghosts, all right?

302
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:45,840
I didn't see him as anything other
than a concerned citizen.

303
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,508
Ok, and then?

304
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,377
Well, then he's doing
all of his good stuff,

305
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,046
and then he asks me where
the fire chief is going on his vacation.

306
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:53,848
So I give him the address
of his summer cabin.

307
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,316
Next day,
the cabin blows up.

308
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,784
You confront
Darhk about this?

309
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:59,153
Of course I did.
And that's when

310
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,522
he shows me
pictures of Laurel.

311
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:03,090
At work,

312
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:05,626
at home,
AA meetings.

313
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:08,863
So this thing
with your brother,

314
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:10,131
is it going to be a problem

315
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,233
for us working together?

316
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:16,070
No, Detective.

317
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:19,440
Because you being next to Darhk
is going to help us take down HIVE.

318
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:23,211
Any luck connecting
Sara's victims?

319
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:27,915
Just that she's only killed
muggers and street thugs.

320
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,451
I still can't believe
that it's Sara

321
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:32,153
we're talking about.

322
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,655
That she's alive.
I mean, I know how it's possible,

323
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:37,692
but how is it possible?

324
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:40,461
The world
is a much more...

325
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:42,463
Complicated place
than most people

326
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:43,998
are comfortable
believing.

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
I received an old message
from Ray,

328
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:49,971
in the moment
right before he died.

329
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:52,974
I almost didn't
listen to it,

330
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:55,176
because...

331
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:58,579
I didn't--I didn't
want to feel that grief again.

332
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:01,916
The threat of zombie
apocalypse aside,

333
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,417
isn't it kind of nice not
having to deal

334
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,187
with the pain
of saying good-bye?

335
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:08,322
Well, if it were that simple.

336
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:14,295
Not a day goes by
that I don't

337
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:16,430
miss my parents,

338
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:18,733
or Tommy.

339
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:22,503
And I think about
what I would...

340
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:25,907
give just to spend
another minute,

341
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:31,178
but what's happening
with Sara isn't

342
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,651
healing anyone's pain;
It's just--it's making it worse.

343
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,253
She almost killed
those two girls.

344
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:42,857
I mean, why would she
even go after them?

345
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:45,559
Her marble collection's
a little incomplete.

346
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:47,094
Just guessing.

347
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,830
Well, they have
something in common?

348
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:52,199
Well...

349
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,669
The waitress was
Stephanie Dangess,

350
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:57,605
and the girl at the club
was Lindsay Paulson.

351
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:58,873
Oh, my God,
both these girls--

352
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,542
they look like Thea.

353
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:03,945
♪ When you walk
in the room ♪

354
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,681
♪ it catches fire ♪

355
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:09,150
Last thing I want,
judgment for tonight.

356
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:20,628
Ho-wa An-tea!

357
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,367
I just can't believe that Sara
would do something like this.

358
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,164
She's not Sara.

359
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:37,429
No, that's not it.

360
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,365
Hey, hey.

361
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,066
How you feeling?

362
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,501
Ah, Sara, she--

363
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,970
Ah, I know, it's ok.
You're safe.

364
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:47,540
She tried to kill me.

365
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,341
She's not in her
right mind.

366
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,844
You have no idea.

367
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,981
This is the Pit.

368
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,350
She's going through
the same thing I am.

369
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,321
I--Thea, I thought that
you were better.

370
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:06,025
When I went
to Nanda Parbat, I...

371
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:09,395
Killed two guys.

372
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,832
Malcolm--

373
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:17,870
Malcolm served them up
on a platter for me,

374
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:21,407
and... helped keep
my blood lust at bay.

375
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,378
Oh, my God.

376
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,613
Thank God
you're all right.

377
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,181
Laurel, come with me.

378
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,087
Is Thea ok?

379
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,660
No.

380
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,263
Not only is
Thea hospitalized,

381
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:47,600
but she has Merlyn
influencing her to kill people.

382
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:49,168
What are you talking about?

383
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,103
Oh, just another
thing that happened

384
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:52,705
on your secret trip
to Nanda Parbat.

385
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:55,374
Hey! I didn't tell you
that I took my sister

386
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,576
to Nanda Parbat because I knew that
you wouldn't approve.

387
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,112
Why didn't you tell me
you took Thea?

388
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:02,047
What does that have
to do with anything?!

389
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,649
It's the hypocrisy
that I can't stand!

390
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:05,417
What?

391
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,420
It's ok for you to do
whatever you have to for your sister,

392
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,389
but it's not ok for me
to do the same to mine?

393
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:12,024
Sara was dead.

394
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:13,626
Thea wasn't.

395
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,060
Then why didn't you tell me

396
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,962
about Thea
seven months ago?

397
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,602
Because you don't see me
as an equal.

398
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,604
What? Oh, come on.

399
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,906
Laurel, of course
I see you as an equal.

400
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,242
No, you don't!
You never have.

401
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:32,745
You never told me
that you were the Arrow--

402
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:34,380
keep your voice down!

403
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:35,914
...becoming
the Black Canary,

404
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,616
and you never
would have told me

405
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,452
that there's a way
to save my sister.

406
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,655
My sister, she's out of her
mind right now.

407
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:45,090
Because of something
that I did.

408
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:47,559
A decision
that I made.

409
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,829
Did you ever just stop
and think for one second

410
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,165
about what I might
be going through?

411
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:58,237
I'm sorry about what
happened to Thea.

412
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:01,607
I really am.
I love your family--

413
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,776
I always have.

414
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:06,345
I just wish
that sometimes

415
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:08,380
you would give
a damn about mine.

416
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,789
Get out.

417
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:21,760
You're sure
this is the place?

418
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,495
It's the place.

419
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,030
What's going on,
who are you?

420
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,432
How much do you know
about what your boss

421
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:27,800
is really doing
on this island, mate?

422
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:29,368
He's making drugs.

423
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,236
If only.

424
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,806
Your friend Reiter,
he's the dangerous sort.

425
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,507
What's that
supposed to mean?

426
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,909
It means there are
things on this island

427
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:38,277
that bad people
shouldn't have access to.

428
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,913
Says the guy with a gun
pointed at my head.

429
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:43,882
Ah. I'm not a bad guy.

430
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:46,251
A little hard
scrabble, sure,

431
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,908
but, uh, I'm on the side
of the angels, mate.

432
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,932
At least when they're busy
trying to screw me over.

433
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:56,273
You're right.
This is the spot.

434
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,681
Ahh.

435
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:10,554
De cruinne-ce
agus akasha

436
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,924
seall me do solas!

437
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:24,601
What? You've never
seen magic before?

438
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:34,978
Well, go on
then, Alice.

439
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,147
Down the rabbit
hole you go.

440
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,727
Nice job
getting us in.

441
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:42,995
You learn how to do that before
or after working for Queen?

442
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:44,262
Save that
for another story.

443
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:47,432
Yeah, I bet.

444
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:48,343
Is this the access point?

445
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,069
Yeah, yeah, looks like it.

446
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,937
All right, keep an eye out
for rent-a-cops,

447
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:54,806
'cause it wouldn't do
my career prospects too much good.

448
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:58,610
It working?

449
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,779
Yeah, I think so.
Looks like the virus

450
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,848
is erasing files on people.

451
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,684
Which people,
and why?

452
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,452
Both really good questions.

453
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:13,158
Hey.

454
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,659
Hey.

455
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:16,762
What are you...
doing here?

456
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:18,964
Waiting for you
to wake up.

457
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:22,601
Thea, I owe you
an apology.

458
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:24,770
No, no, there's no need

459
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:27,305
for you to apologize
for anything.

460
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:29,274
Yes, I do.

461
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:34,046
I brought Sara back without
any idea of how to control her.

462
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:37,516
I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

463
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:40,152
That--

464
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:43,321
that's why she's
after me, you know.

465
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:46,391
This blood lust
she's consumed by...

466
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:50,896
It's the same pain I feel
when I think about Ra's.

467
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,531
I don't understand.

468
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,802
Because the person
that I'm driven to kill,

469
00:21:56,804 --> 00:22:01,640
the one who killed me
is already dead.

470
00:22:01,642 --> 00:22:03,575
Thea, what are you
talking about?

471
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:07,279
As soon as she kills me,
she'll be ok.

472
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:10,215
If the only way
to save Sara is to kill you,

473
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:12,484
then that's
no cure at all.

474
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:15,816
How much longer?

475
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,241
Two minutes.

476
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,182
Wait, wait, what was that?

477
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,496
What is it?

478
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:24,796
I just saw my brother's name.

479
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:26,565
What is that all about?

480
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,779
What'd you do?

481
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:30,203
I didn't do anything!

482
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:31,736
I just have to get back
to whatever it is that's been erased.

483
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,205
No, no, no,
we don't have time.

484
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:34,272
Security's going to be
on their way now.

485
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:37,075
I'm not leaving.

486
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:39,444
Drop it! Drop it now!

487
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:40,879
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
it's all right, it's all right!

488
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,280
Captain Lance,
Star City police department.

489
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:44,816
I just tracked
this hacker here.

490
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:46,952
All right. Now, look,

491
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,887
go get some back-up,
all right?

492
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,623
Call this in,
come on, go, go!

493
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:57,362
It's a good story. I just
wish you would have told me

494
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:58,897
before you gave me
a concussion.

495
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:01,633
Come on. Then it wouldn't
have looked real.

496
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,082
I didn't know
you were still here.

497
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,917
Hey.

498
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,820
Yeah, I just came to make
sure Thea was ok.

499
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:23,889
I didn't have
a chance to before, so.

500
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:25,590
She's sleeping.

501
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:27,359
Trying to.

502
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:31,263
Look, I--

503
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,098
I know why
you're here.

504
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,934
Ok, I get it.

505
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,271
I want you--

506
00:23:39,273 --> 00:23:43,008
I want you to know
that it's--

507
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,043
it's ok.

508
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:46,545
I want you to do it.

509
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,785
About what
I said before--

510
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:55,287
You said some things
that you meant.

511
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,290
Thea!

512
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:19,185
You sure you want
to be here?

513
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:20,947
I hated hospitals
before tonight.

514
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:23,635
Ah. It's just another
excuse to stay away.

515
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:25,585
At the hospital,
I looked Sara in the eyes.

516
00:24:25,587 --> 00:24:28,054
She wasn't there.
What does that mean?

517
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:30,156
The Pit is not supposed to be
used on the dead.

518
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:32,359
It brought Sara's body back,
but all of this is happening--

519
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:35,428
Because it didn't
restore her soul.

520
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:39,633
We still need
to find her, ok?

521
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:41,968
Sara died long
before you moved in with Laurel,

522
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,404
and she knew exactly
which hospital room to look for you in.

523
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:46,673
What, you think Sara
can sense Thea somehow?

524
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:48,942
And here I was just wrapping
my mind around metahumans.

525
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:50,911
Wait, we've both
been in the Pit.

526
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:53,813
Maybe--maybe that
gives us some type of connection.

527
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:55,382
A connection we can use.

528
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:56,983
Thea, you just got
out of the hospital.

529
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,718
I don't want
to use you as bait.

530
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,754
Well, I guess
it's a good thing

531
00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:03,523
you're not
in charge anymore.

532
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:07,160
We'll have her back,
Oliver. All of us.

533
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:12,832
I don't understand.
How did you...

534
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,534
Well, that's the great thing
about magic.

535
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:16,670
Can't be explained.

536
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:18,772
There are places in this world
as old as the world.

537
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:20,941
Places of Nexus,

538
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:22,375
draw bad people
to them.

539
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:24,511
This island
is such place.

540
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:27,380
It's no accident
that you're here.

541
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:33,620
Let me guess--

542
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:35,055
"Do not enter."

543
00:25:35,057 --> 00:25:38,825
More like, only for
the pure of heart.

544
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,731
That's not
you, mate.

545
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,809
There you are,
my pretty girl.

546
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:59,746
How do you know
it's a girl?

547
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:01,948
I can do that
trick, too.

548
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,684
Clever boy.

549
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:07,153
I'd usually be
more artful,

550
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:09,456
but I'm on something
of a clock.

551
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:13,159
Get back!

552
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,734
I'm not a bad guy, either.

553
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:28,575
Mission accomplished.

554
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:30,377
Well done.

555
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:35,915
Are you sticking around for a cupcake
or something?

556
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,784
This thing you had me do,

557
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:39,853
I saw some of the names
you had erased.

558
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,187
All military.

559
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:42,956
And here I had you
pegged for a Luddite.

560
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,491
Fast learner.

561
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:48,495
One of those names--
Sergeant Andrew Diggle.

562
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,930
What is he to you?

563
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,465
He died 6 years ago.

564
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:55,335
Why are you erasing the record
of a dead man?

565
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:57,203
You know what,
I'm going to tell you.

566
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:00,707
And only because you completed
your task with such efficiency.

567
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,009
We hired an assassin

568
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:04,711
to murder
Sergeant Diggle.

569
00:27:04,713 --> 00:27:06,212
Why?

570
00:27:06,214 --> 00:27:08,081
Afghanistan's
an interesting place,

571
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,482
replete with
opportunities

572
00:27:09,484 --> 00:27:11,685
for an enterprising
enlisted man to engage in.

573
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,520
What are you talking about?

574
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:15,021
Drugs, weapons, murder.

575
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,157
Your Sergeant Diggle
was an eager beaver.

576
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,059
Unfortunately for him,
our organization

577
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:20,994
weaved itself into
that part of the world,

578
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,829
and as you know,
we don't play well with others.

579
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,364
So you had him
killed?

580
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,066
What is this guy,
your best buddy?

581
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:29,102
I don't see you associating
yourself with crime lords.

582
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:31,838
Ha, present company excepted.

583
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:37,010
Now, are we done?

584
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:45,585
Set.

585
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:49,589
I have to say, it feels
really weird being back here right now.

586
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:52,859
Don't worry.
Everyone's in position.

587
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:55,595
It's nothing, ok?
I--I don't think

588
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:58,631
this is going
to actually work.

589
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:02,836
Oh, God,
I take that back.

590
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:12,779
Get her out of here!

591
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:30,263
Dad was right.

592
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:32,665
There's nothing left
inside of you, Sara!

593
00:28:36,438 --> 00:28:37,526
Tranq arrow.

594
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,839
No.

595
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,040
No, you said it yourself,
she has no soul.

596
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:43,476
Laurel...

597
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:45,044
Let's get it back.

598
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:53,497
Oliver.

599
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:54,487
John.

600
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:55,955
It's been a dog's age, mate.

601
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,957
More than. Do you remember that
favor you owe me?

602
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,893
I hardly expect you
to let me forget about that.

603
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:02,028
How quickly can you get
to Star City?

604
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,097
I need your help.

605
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:09,485
So what, you're
going to perform

606
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:11,379
some kind of exorcism
on my sister?

607
00:29:11,381 --> 00:29:13,781
No, an exorcism is a removal
of demonic possession.

608
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:16,851
What your sister needs
is a restitutionem,

609
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:19,720
the restoration
of her soul to her body.

610
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:21,556
And you've
done this before?

611
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:24,258
Ah, once. Maybe a year ago.

612
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,227
But don't worry,
it's just like riding a bike.

613
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:27,395
I'm sure we have a lot
of work to do to prepare.

614
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:30,498
I assume you brought a list?

615
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,800
Apologies. I didn't have
time to translate that

616
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:34,735
from its original Aramaic.

617
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:37,705
You know, if I knew you were
surrounded by so many pretty girls, Oliver,

618
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:40,808
I would have
stopped by sooner.

619
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:44,412
Where did Oliver find
this guy, the Luxor?

620
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:45,980
Oh, I'm just glad that the
latest person from Oliver's past

621
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:48,282
is not another
gorgeous woman.

622
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:02,630
I'm not even
going to ask.

623
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:06,000
You got my message.
I'm so happy you came.

624
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:08,436
I'm her father, too.

625
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:11,005
I hate to be the one to say this,
but what if something goes wrong?

626
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,608
Oh, don't worry.
If things go wrong,

627
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,443
then we'll all be
too dead to care.

628
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:17,845
Well, then.
Now we just need a--

629
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:19,180
I think I got everything
in here that you wanted,

630
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:21,182
although I am not
entirely sure

631
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,650
what you need a dead
peacock feather for.

632
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,518
Ah.

633
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,321
Ahh.

634
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:29,457
Oh, nice one.

635
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,659
That's been bugging
me for hours.

636
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:33,861
Now,

637
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:37,331
I've only got enough juice
to send myself and two of you

638
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,367
to the other realm
and back, so.

639
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,669
Oh, I think
it should be me.

640
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:45,940
Um, I'm the reason
why she's like this right now.

641
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:48,409
No offense, love,
but from what I hear,

642
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,478
you're not exactly
bringing out the best

643
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,280
in Sara right now,
are you?

644
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:54,749
Laurel.

645
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,450
Do you trust me?

646
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:01,756
Trust me when I tell you
this will work.

647
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:13,067
Oh, there's, uh,
one more thing.

648
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:15,436
Whatever's locked
her soul away,

649
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:18,673
it's not going to give
it over without a fight.

650
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:20,875
So be ready.

651
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:22,743
All right, then.

652
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:25,680
On with the show.

653
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,957
Pelako ameso yobe eleggua

654
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,126
imbone ukuchila panshita.

655
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:41,262
De domino vestro, aliquis.

656
00:31:41,264 --> 00:31:45,700
Et stabit de domino vestro.
Audite vocem meam.

657
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:51,372
Ancor, anchor,
candones helosi

658
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:52,873
et vos eleutis phugori...

659
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,047
De cruinne-ce agus akasha

660
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:03,117
seall me do solas!

661
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:05,720
Oliver!

662
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:11,726
Ah, well,
I've had worse hangovers.

663
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:13,694
So what are we
supposed to do now?

664
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:16,831
Laurel!
Laurel, no!

665
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:24,638
This is new.

666
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,906
Well, new is why you
brought me along.

667
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:27,308
Help!

668
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,976
No, no, no, no.

669
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:30,854
Well, I'm not going
to just stand here!

670
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,426
We need a tour guide.

671
00:32:38,468 --> 00:32:41,288
Axis mundi,
produco tuus vires.

672
00:32:56,731 --> 00:32:58,366
This way.

673
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,268
Unless you want to be trapped here
for all eternity.

674
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,339
This is what locked away
Sara's soul?

675
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:07,474
How the human mind
perceives it, anyway.

676
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:10,177
Help!

677
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:15,482
Help!

678
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:17,351
Sara!

679
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:21,855
Get to the Pit. You need to work
together to get her out.

680
00:33:21,857 --> 00:33:23,290
I'll take care
of our new friend.

681
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,693
No, Sara!

682
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,498
You want some of me?

683
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,743
You know, any time
today would be good.

684
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:48,215
Per júdicem vivórum
et mortuórum!

685
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:52,219
Qui habet potestatem
mittere in infernum!

686
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,891
Abire ex regno--

687
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,000
2, 3!

688
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:12,640
Whoo.

689
00:34:14,977 --> 00:34:17,544
You're all right.

690
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:20,648
Everything's going
to be all right.

691
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,852
What happened?

692
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,086
What is she?

693
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:28,155
Did we...

694
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,514
Sara!

695
00:34:55,232 --> 00:34:57,165
Thank you, John.
I owe you one.

696
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,234
I believe I owed
you one, mate.

697
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:01,670
Hows about we just
call it even, eh?

698
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:04,106
How about any time,
anywhere you need me,

699
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,974
I'll be there.

700
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:08,176
I'll take that.

701
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:09,811
You know, the hair
on the back of my neck

702
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:12,781
has been standing up
since the moment I got into town.

703
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:15,384
That is probably
our current problem--

704
00:35:15,386 --> 00:35:18,086
Damian Darhk.

705
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:20,389
Ohh, you've heard of him.

706
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:23,058
You watch yourself
on that one, mate.

707
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,595
He'll make what you saw in the other realm
look like a bloody gnat.

708
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:29,297
Any helpful advice?

709
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:30,465
Yeah.

710
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:35,170
Leave town.
While you still can.

711
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:39,474
Well, he's a very specific
kind of yummy.

712
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:42,577
Oh! I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear you just say that.

713
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:46,848
Are--are we ok?

714
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,218
I mean, I just keep
waiting for you to blow up at me.

715
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,320
Because you lied to me
about Nanda Parbat?

716
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:53,755
Yeah.

717
00:35:53,757 --> 00:35:56,658
Thea, I don't have
the right to be mad

718
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,196
at anyone for keeping secrets.

719
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:03,765
But I'm sorry that I made you
feel as though you had to.

720
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,001
Come here.

721
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:13,108
Thanks, mate.
I owe you one.

722
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,110
What the hell
is all this?

723
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:17,379
Oh, this is
the Orb of Horus.

724
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:19,514
It's actually
a grimoire.

725
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:21,383
An ancient
spell book.

726
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:22,784
You asked.

727
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:25,754
And, uh, what are you going
to do with it?

728
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:28,724
Same as I do with all
the other mystical objects I find--

729
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:30,258
I keep them in a safe place,

730
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,828
away from the Baron Reiters
of this world.

731
00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:38,800
Remember what I told you
about this island, mate.

732
00:36:38,802 --> 00:36:42,370
This Reiter bloke is not
only here for the narcotics.

733
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:45,540
But then again, it's not
your problem, is it?

734
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:47,976
Come back with me.

735
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:50,312
I've got a boat
on the southern shore.

736
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:52,414
You saw those
people at camp.

737
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,850
I can't
leave them behind.

738
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,852
Well, aren't you the hero?

739
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:59,855
I also can't come back
empty-handed.

740
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:02,257
Conklin suspects me
enough as it is.

741
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:04,860
Fair enough.

742
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:10,232
Here.

743
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,468
Goons like Reiter,
they're only interested

744
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,170
in the sparkly bits,
anyway. The real power

745
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:17,372
is in the spell.

746
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:20,375
Here. Here, I'll show you.

747
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:26,982
Yateeka masaha
la hasra laha

748
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:32,754
watahseen hayda
albaled almodeef...

749
00:37:32,756 --> 00:37:35,290
Lift up your shirt, mate?

750
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:39,194
What?

751
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:43,365
Mah qoo-wat
min aldaw alzalam.

752
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,004
What the hell
did you just do?

753
00:37:49,006 --> 00:37:52,741
I gave you some
insurance against Reiter.

754
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:54,643
And when the time comes,

755
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:56,011
you'll know how to use it.

756
00:37:56,013 --> 00:38:00,749
Now, I believe,
that concludes our business.

757
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,720
I--i need you
to punch me in the face.

758
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:08,990
Right. My, uh,
escape attempt

759
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:10,358
left a bruise, right?

760
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,427
All right.
I must warn you,

761
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,763
I've got a hell
of a right hook.

762
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,167
I'm--I'm fine.

763
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:20,535
Thanks very much.

764
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:22,370
All right,
so just stay on message.

765
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:24,206
Unity, united
community.

766
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,490
United. Got it.

767
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:26,175
All right.

768
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:28,076
Hey, Laurel.

769
00:38:28,078 --> 00:38:30,445
Ok, maybe we need
to work on your understanding

770
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:32,414
of the phrase
"distance yourself."

771
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:35,750
Only if you insist on continuing to use it
when it relates to my friends.

772
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:37,953
Ok.

773
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:41,156
It's your campaign.

774
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:44,125
You pay me whether
you win or lose.

775
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:49,564
Um, I am going to go
keep him from quitting.

776
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:52,667
But I'm very proud
of you right now.

777
00:38:58,308 --> 00:38:59,674
How's Sara?

778
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:01,509
Resting.

779
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:05,680
It turns out that getting your soul
back is exhausting.

780
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:07,382
Yeah.

781
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:09,718
Ollie...

782
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,020
I don't know how I'm ever going
to be able to thank you.

783
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:13,855
Just like that.

784
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,725
Well, thank you.

785
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:20,028
And thank you
for inviting me here tonight.

786
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,130
After what I said to
you in the hospital,

787
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,466
I thought that I'd be the last person
you'd want to see.

788
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:26,368
Well, you were right. I--

789
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,904
I haven't always been
the best friend for you,

790
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:32,474
but I--I'd be grateful
for the opportunity

791
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:34,276
to try and start to be.

792
00:39:36,246 --> 00:39:37,946
How can I say no
to the man

793
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:41,182
that helped me save
my sister's soul?

794
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:48,089
Mistakes that have
hurt people close to me.

795
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:50,025
But I'm not here
to run from the past.

796
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:51,760
Because the past has
contributed to making--

797
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,560
I thought you'd be out
celebrating with Sara.

798
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,037
Yeah, there's
enough time for that.

799
00:39:59,137 --> 00:40:00,044
Please.

800
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:03,807
I figured
I owed you something.

801
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:06,709
I asked Darhk
about your brother.

802
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:09,178
He, uh, gave me something.

803
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:13,950
You don't have to read this.

804
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:17,086
You can remember
your brother how you knew him.

805
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:41,744
Are you sure about this?

806
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:43,746
Yeah, it's legit.

807
00:40:43,748 --> 00:40:46,115
I'm very sorry.

808
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:50,253
Thank you, Detective.

809
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,822
Gut punch doesn't
deserve a thank you.

810
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:55,725
I wanted to know why...

811
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:57,793
HIVE had my brother killed,

812
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:00,129
and now I do, so...

813
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:14,977
Felicity! Welcome back!
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

814
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:17,079
How many of these
have you drank?

815
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:19,582
It's "drunk," actually, and many.
But worth it.

816
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,417
You cleared up
the rest of Ray's message?

817
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:22,785
I think so. Uh,
the playback was rendering

818
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:24,887
when you came in.
So, propitious timing.

819
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,255
Ok, you're not even allowed to
say "energy drink"

820
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:27,890
while on company
time ever again.

821
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:29,191
That's ok; I think
I might be having

822
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:30,960
a cardiac incident, anyway.

823
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:32,662
So, the message, check it out.
I was just about to call you.

824
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:34,096
Wait, where's my phone.
Wait, did I call you already?

825
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:36,465
Curtis!

826
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:38,634
I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.

827
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:41,771
I--I got myself into this
mess screwing around

828
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:45,708
with my exosuit
and nanotechnology.

829
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,545
But recriminations probably aren't probably
the best use of this limited bandwidth.

830
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:51,347
What I need you to know is,

831
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:55,384
I'm alive,
and I'm in trouble.

832

833
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:22,549
Greg!
Move your head.
