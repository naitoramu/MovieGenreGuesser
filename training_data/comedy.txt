take it how is that gonna happen i dont know yeah i met him at that christmas party we really hit it off you mean the guy who kept calling you ron i didnt say we were brothers friends  x  estelle dies ªäïä¾ãþmeitina ãàììàö¹êòmeitina adjusted by madhero hey phoebe hey tell me what you think the house next door to the one that were buying in westchester i wanna take a look at it but chandler doesnt we close escrow tomorrow so seeing another house can only confuse us and were easily confused were not very bright but what if it is better than ours what do you think pheebs well i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins anyway hey isnt joeys agent estelle leonard yeah youre kidding yeah last saturday wow she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic oh wait a minute i read the wrong one oh yeah joeys gonna be so upset i know he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic well we cannot tell joey about this this will push him over the edge seriously you dont think we should tell him well not for a little while what if he reads it in the paper unless snoopy says it to charlie brown i think were okay may i help you yeah im a friend of rachel greens oh right uhm don uh what can i do for you uhm well ah did she ask you to come here and do this oh no wow that is tempting look she loved her job here and lets face it youre not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it she is good but im sorry theres nothing i can do ah its not true there is nothing i want to do i see thanks very much is this your son yeah his name is ross what oh nothing its just its close to ron does he does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance yeah theyre all he talks about why how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left and he can touch anything he wants i just heard it as you must have heard it and thats not good im a paleontologist youll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones  fossils you can really arrange that you let rachel come back and its done well i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world yeah yes thank you this is great and i swear your kid is going to have the time of his life thats great i worry about little ross hes always reading hes collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs hey phoebe hey everything ok im just mad at my agent estelle why theres a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didnt even be put up for it shed better have a good reason im guessing she does well well no no wait wait wait just listen ok why because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason i love that saying hello i was just gonna call you thats weird its a little coincidental but believable listen im sure youre wondering why i didnt get you an audition for that tv movie yeah actually i am i guess i dropped the ball there whoopsie thats it you know it seems all you do lately is drop the ball dont take that tone with me who you think you are alan lemond the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic no no look and youre not getting me into any auditions and im tired of it what are you saying im saying that man tough week for estelle hi emma left her stuffed trex at my house you know she cant sleep without it oh well shes asleep now stop forcing that thing on her ok oh youre not gonna believe what happened to me today ralph lauren called and gave me my job back nooo yee i mean it was so weirdest thing i mean that place must have been falling apart without me so youre not going to paris no im still going wh  wh  what when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back  they offered me more money hi were buying the house next door oh sure im showing it to someone else right now but please look around thanks it feels like were cheating on our house and if were gonna cheat shouldnt it be with like a hot younger house ours is so much better this living room is smaller the dining room looks like a cave so what do you think love it well we already have one offer on it they could be our neighbors what are they like oh the woman upstairs is very nice oh my god sure hey joey want come with me to  are you ok yeah i just  i just feel bad about firing estelle no that wouldnt kill her ordinary embolism might i dont know and im guessing he eats more money than he makes look i know shes not a great agent but she did stick with me for ten years im gonna call her and hire her again no no no dont call her  why which  is the key to a happy heart you blow me away all right so promise youre gonna wait for her to call you i promise and that means never having to give a reason what a small world and yet i never run into beyonc you two know each

gotta mean something that was not a neardeath experience you werent there maybe this is something that okay you know what maybe this is not about seizing stuff maybe this is about escaping stuff okay

monica and chandler i know theyll be so happy together two best friends in love not that often im so happy for them me too so happy for them im so happy and not at all jealous oh no god definitely not jealous im probably  happy whats  thats nothing totally im like   have you guys seen chandler no but you know who tenille so that marriage stuff you dont really believe that in fact i think the whole concept look at pigs lets take pigs dont mate for life a pig can have   sexual partners and thats just an ordinary pig wait a minute are you telling me never say never but probably     yeah never oh my god then what are we even doing whoa whoa whoa is this some new strategy why dont you put down your copy you know what i gotta go its okay i got a plan were gonna find love yeah im pretty confident about that thats what makes it so easy to be would be nice to have a guarantee some people make deals with a friend like if neither of them are married you mean a backup ive got that you do who joey are you serious i locked him in years ago wait so if neither of you are yep we shook on it but believe me that is not seriously i think his exact words were    charming hes just a backup hey monica have you seen rachel its for my boat cool huh yeah its great whats the matter just realizing hes giving you a hard time i dont want to get married tomorrow   were going somewhere you know chandler not anymore maybe you changed i didnt change maybe thats the problem what one who is unlikely to take a wife does he think ill just face it and always will be well theres some people there are richard said he wants to marry you and chandler says he hates marriage chandler loves marriage you just told me he hates marriage that hes a complex fellow that hes against marriage you got that from what i said rach come on in im so sorry thanks yeah i really thought i guess it just wasnt meant to be yeah love its a tricky business isnt it i guess so so what do you say we make a pact if you and i are both single by  i mean we know each other   weve already slept together no like whats that oh you want me to be your backup yeah i already have one who phoebe but she just said joey is her backup oh i dont think so i just spoke with her she said thats impossible we shook on it although believe me where have you been i was making a coconut phone richard told monica what stop messing with her and i would have if these damn oh my god hes not supposed to ask her i know you know what ill do will you help me look us getting our asses kicked look just go and find monica im gonna get the ring     ill

great great  so do you have any questions for us all right well thank you  thank you  we will call you i do have one question do you guys do random drug testing boy we hadnt really thought of that thats cool but if you do okeydokey were never gonna find a nanny come on rach we will i promise worse comes to worst we can always  what the blond with no bra just a sec okay this ones name is sandy shes got a degree in she worked for her last family hi im sandy and shes a little mannish oh my god david  is this a bad time wow hi oh my gosh what are you doing here just for a couple of days im here to explain to the people why its a positive thing that and accomplished nothing who cares it got you here it got me to new york and the guy said where to i just gave him your address wheres your luggage damn it all right ill call the cab company we can call them later boy theres an old russian expression roughly translated that means this thing that im looking at wow thank you you should see me when are you kidding you know when you dont see you build them up in your head come on dont be crazy but well you are well so are you seeing anyone no im just the worst person ever how can i not tell david maybe he didnt give you a chance he said are you seeing someone well that wouldve been your window i mean i dont know and i was just thinking hes so irresistible  really the scientist guy continue then it gets worse because i told him  phoebe i like mike so much you know isnt it ironic that david on the same day that yeah you know and given you can imagine how happy i am  what are you gonna do tell david that nothing unless i dont you know complicated moral situation  no right no wrong i knew i shouldve had this conversation funniest guy shes ever met im funny right what do you know youre a door you just like knockknock jokes save it for inside so oklahomas a crazy place you know frankly id sooner be in any other state and whats with oklahoma can all states have stuff like that hey yeah im from the waistband but when i was  was your cabin pressurized and dont get me started on the way okay whats with the word yall you know are we all allowed to do that you know your new poodle and fried chicken could be fricken waiter waiter excuse me see thats funny with the fricken right no it just reminds me of something i told you about that funny guy jeffrey yeah he came up well he did this bit but it was liza minnelli locked  were you there i really understand how hard its gotta be i mean its like leaving behind sandy thats exactly what it is are you gay its okay i get that a lot doing what i do but i am straight im engaged actually  her names delia so youre just like i realize how its a bit unorthodox but i really believe the most satisfying is take care of a child okay like at my last job i met daniel when he was and i got to watch him grow when i left i said ill see you soon and he said to me skadandy that was his name for me ill see you every day right in  its okay oh god she must need  i can take care of that if you want i love him i love him i love him come on rach hes a guy so what hes smart hes qualified give me one good reason because its weird why what kind of a job is that for a man i mean its like if a woman yes king i hope you dont mind i used its a mixture of calendula and plus it keeps the hands young yes sandy youre hired thats great im sorry its just such an emotional thing oh god come here you gotta be at least bi i need you to set me up for a joke when monicas around i dont know chandler im not thank god your livelihood i know right why are we doing this monica says that her maitre d is  seriously she actually said that  no being funnys your thing without that you just got hi there you are fire trucks wow you look even more beautiful in fact im going to kiss you now  wait wait it sounded sexy in my head so i no no its not that remember when you asked me if well i am his names mike  i shouldve told you well yeah  im sorry im sorry well are you happy with this guy  i am happy im sorry i dont mean that but only with me no thats not fair i dont mean that yes i do i think i should probably go but david i just want you to know that telling you this is one of the well just so you know hearing it wasnt exactly  can we at least hug goodbye you know and a kiss on the cheek  no no  in minsk its two on each cheek and one on the lips in new york its oh boy is everything all right oh yeah no its fine its fine sandy was just telling me about how he and it was so beautiful her favorite flower is the camellia i cant hear it again you know i cant tell it again and im fine never having heard it  rach can i see you for a sec do you realize that man has cried i havent cried that many times look ross sandys just sensitive okay okay see that is the problem too sensitive to take care of our baby no i mean that guy sandy made madeleines this is exactly what kind of a guy makes delicate theyre not even butch you know with chunks well you know i mean i never thought of you as a guy i gotta tell you ross its not like you hey theres sensitive and okay what is too sensitive no i cant i cant do this its bad but its nice and nice is good and good is not bad  no no no ergo look david if you had never left then yeah wed probably still be together but you did leave and im with mike goodbye the key works and you thanks for the face massage did rachel tell you we hired i think thats great did she tell you he plays the recorder  how are they rachel and i hired a male nanny really guys do that  thats weird  thats like a woman wanting to be  whats the end of that sentence a penis model anyway did you tell chandler is the funniest guy you ever met  yeah so really do you not know chandler is that why hes acting so weird oh my god that is crazy  its not like im attracted to jeffrey being funny is chandlers thing science academia being a good father  i cant believe hes that upset because hes feeling like what are you guys talking about rachel and i hired a male nanny you got a man whos a nanny you got a manny you know i dont mind a male nanny but i do draw the line you are on a roll mister if id known you guys were coming over okay okay stop it you what is so funny about that i dont know its i mean youre funny you have did you tell her what we talked about so those were pity laughs honey listen you have

our clothes its like child abuse i say if jesus saw that hed freak out toby i mean on so many levels  im supposed to just letting oscar vent a little we would use the break room  whats the problem  its just a little dispute over  since christmas i forget are you guys dating  michael can i talk to you heres how i usually handle this you know these things just have its like if you write someone they say to keep it in your drawer and then you just never what do you know about your answer to everything  okay that was a right decision well thats not gonna fly here it is till death do us part assuming that we dont get pam would you get angela and meet us a mediators toolchest okay well before we get started that there are five my shaolin temple style can we go  this is important  the first style is loselose just hold on please okay if we do loselose do you understand  you you would both lose now i need to ask you do you want to pursue can we just skip to whatever winwin is number four the important difference here is me too i win for having successfully okay so this is the disputed poster now one at a time using i emotion language and i got this poster for christmas and it makes me feel like the babies and god has a really come on seriously that  i dont like looking at it its creepy and in bad taste it makes me think of the horrible who forced the babies into it its kitsch it destroys art it destroys souls this is so much more offensive  im talking about the kind lets see if we cant just brainstorm  that are winwin yes thank you pam how about angela makes the poster that way he can never see it she can see it winwinwin  no well brainstorm own the solution  how about i leave it up  how about angela can keep it up okay that is called a compromise and it is style three to sum up winwin winlose take the poster down compromise tuesdays and thursdays make the poster into a tshirt  winwin  fine it is done  no youre all good hey angela thanks it was handdelivered but i did get a save the date its not my taste you solved it we can throw that one out are those all the other complaints  i would like to see those please  i cant do that now you and i have a conflict i order you to give me that file that there no more conflict i had to use the winlose on that all right is that it  its all dwights every friday at   i have for him to file a grievance i tell him that im sending them that box is the special file oh god all right why do i have to do everything  are you sure  oh hes sure just shoot this is from kevin he says stanley uses his meredith complains that everyone and the lights are too bright creed creed is sick of looking and wants a seat nice you will notice that not one actually i have a separate folder this is january through march how many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain and did you get what you wanted you forget about your problem that is outrageous and it pains me to see festering today we are going to get and into the open all right how about  you already did me the thing is angela you have complained about except dwight which is odd because  everyone else toby by the way there is a file full of complaints it just means whoever complained so i took their name off there were a bunch of complaints that were put in the redacted file wait if someone has why would they withdraw it lets move on i volunteer did anyone have a problem with me  all right pamela come on down lets do it and okay actually it has been withdrawn so that is no help to us next wait what did it say  does she have to plan her wedding shouldnt she do that at home  who else  why dont we just warm up first  i have this kind of big secret and ive been really nice to her what the hell  here is a kelly complaint ryan never returns my calls my voice mails real spotty i didnt file a complaint to your hr representative to my friend i thought fine ill take your name off making progress  dwight tried to kiss me and i didnt tell anyone cause im that is not true well im not actually making i just really think okay question does that also apply to the permanent sure stanley thanks for ratting me out i didnt do it i find that hard to believe considering you have problems in this entire office someone complained that stanley you know thats not true i didnt say that then why is there a picture okay phyllis you complained and you tried to get off no i never said any such thing and also phyllis stanley says and that bugs him stanley and i are close too  we sit close just take it i cant believe angela i went against my better judgment and now it turns out well it was redacted look if she wants an invite dont take her side well what does roy i dont know i try not to bother him you mean like your thoughts i know you keep even though theres no assigned  yes thats the problem okay well all settled then i dont like you okay ryan you told toby that i know exactly i sprout mung beans on a damp very nutritious all right kevin you are accused of making sexually suggestive that made her feel uncomfortable solution angela you are to make to kevin that will make him i accept your decision you know what dwight  maybe we should get our photo id that doesnt make any sense well it saves time you know cause we could just meet walk in together perfect  smile i never smile if i can help it showing ones teeth is a when someone smiles at me all i see is a chimpanzee this came out really well there you go this is humongous am not a security threat and my middle name is kurt not fart what did i write  i have another complaint talk to

someone replaced all my pens i suspect jim halpert everyone has called me i think jim halpert paid them to yes five bucks each this morning i found a bloody glove and jim halpert tried to convince me i think he may be the real murderer jim halpert said there was in the womans room i saw meredith on the can gaaad this morning i knocked myself that actually took a while i had to put more an more till he got used to the weight everytime i typed my name just a simple macro you know these actually dont but he does deserve it though by the end of the day my desk  was about yeah i just moved it an inch every and thats how i spent the japanese have this thing where they dig into and it is very painful but the next day they feel great ive never had one maybe stamford would be cool its a good

shes faking if a car hit me you know what jumped in front of the car i wouldnt put it past her  so what do you need me to do theres a diabetes shot roll the insulin in your hands she gets an ace inhibitor with her meal but put her right in front of the dish mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine and you wanna give that to her and theres a fungal cream because so youre gonna have to lift her tail okay i have an announcement you pushed darryl out the window  you shot dwight i love my employees even though for which i take full responsibility look im just trying to

awful no okay she always looks i think shes awake shes in the coma i brought all your friends  at the same time  hello meredith brought you some balloons why dont we tie these up cheer up your tubes oh for gods sake  nurse just put it back in i am going to be sick i wouldnt  dont touch it thanks does it hurt terribly no its not too bad really vicodin fentanyl  palladone well it was really great of all of you ill see you guys at the office okay wait up wait up guys you know what i was thinking is if you forgave me im not gonna do that cause you know what they say forgiveness is next to godliness no thats not  you cracked my pelvis i dont understand from laughing this off youre not forgiven come on do i need to be liked absolutely not i like to be liked i enjoy being liked i have to be liked but its not like this compulsive need to be liked like my need to be praised hey hey monkey any problems well you left the tv on and your cat is dead  what sprinkles that was the sick one right but i thought she had more time did she look when you saw her how was she looking really dead like a just a dead cat so hey come on dont be sad okay  shes in a better place actually the place that shes in because of the odor its gonna be okay okay you know what everybody lets just get over she cracked her pelvis a tiny little crack so let just michael angelas cat died sprinkles im sorry angela man what a day huh how could it get any worse and then meredith with the accident sprinkles god thats three things ill tell you whats going on this office is cursed and we need to do something about it well i am taking responsibility an its up to me that hit meredith with my car im not supersticious but im i am a little sticious did anyone do anything  like what or dig up a body toby no i did not violate in fact i had some good luck recently alfredos pizza picked my business card i get a week of free pies  thats cool perfect so our tragedy is your good luck satan sprinkles never hurt a soul god in your infinite wisdom she wasnt ready it is only a cat you never you dont like them cats do not provide  dwight you havent seen meredith well i think you should go i do not respect her but i will go all right i would now like to talk about each of your oh michael satan is the master of lies everything he says is the opposite all right well then you can ask thank you for the permission alright lets just go around the room  catholic  presbyterian  for real im a lutheran and bob is a unitarian thats why were cursed ive been involved in a number of cults you have more fun as a follower kelly you are hindu thats buddhists are you sure no what are you well if youre gonna reduce my identity but i also like hiphop and npr and im restoring a  corvette okay and as a farmer sometimes the right thing to do with the electricity we could power a small fan for two days you tell me whats unethical blink once dont pull any plugs how are you doing miss palmer  better are you a doctor or a male nurse im an intern which makes me a doctor her chart doesnt indicate but she did so that is where her uterus went your last tetanus shot was when you were yes dwight here trapped it just doing my job you also were recently bitten and a rat separate occasions spend your whole life trying to get people to like you with your car and its not even everybody gets on your case god is dead if there was a god maybe believing in god was a mistake what did people believe in before the sun maybe theres some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice to like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with the body of a porcupine i will do some research  okay so just to be safe god rabies i was in the hospital room with her how contagious is that  no you gotta be bitten by something actually the doctor said she was lucky cause the only way to beat rabies before the symptoms set in lockjaw i know a lot of you for endangering merediths life with my car but it may make you feel a little bit dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head six of one really turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies which is like ten times worse thanks to me she went to the hospital curse is broken curse is broken people oh there is a god and he has a plan for us after all get some rest got a lot accomplished is there a god and who is jesus dad oh well if they arent together now i thought theyd be good together like pb  j pam beesly and jim what a waste what a waste i told you im not dating anyone and even if i was i mean when i do fall in love the last person is a camera crew or my coworkers almost marrying roy anderson was as close to pamela anderson trust me michael scotts dunder mifflin scranton celebrity rabies awareness fun run race proam proam race for the they hung up a woman shouldnt have to be hit by a but that is where we are in america and that does not sit right with me and that is why im hosting a fun to raise awareness of the fact a disease that has been but not very many people know that no rabies babies would be a good idea can i put you down for a dime hi stankley zero come on man its for a good cause jan called this morning isnt that your money that is for a good cause  phyllis how the rabies quilt coming oh look at that three you cant make me run its stupid michael you didnt run for me i know that youre probably scared of well back in olden times was a person of power a person who had money a person of respect whereas someone athletic was somebody who worked in the fields i just dont wanna run i didnt bring my sneakers youre gonna have to run it is not olden times anymore im petrified of nipple chafing once it starts is a vicious circle you have sensitive nipples they chafe so they become more sensitive so they chafe more so i take precautions hey angela im sorry about your cat this is sprinkles she was my best friend i kept her i asked dwight schrute to feed her once this is halloween last year just a couple of kittens out on the town im having relationship problems and since youre always having i thought you could give me some advice whats wrong i have this crazy thought that maybe dwight killed my cat when i got home where dwight said he left her but all my bags of frozen french fries somethings not right the vets doing an autopsy angela im sorry did roy ever killed one of your cats im more of a dog person so whats your strategy for this race im gonna start fast then im gonna run fast in the middle  why wont more people do that what oh um no thats not  i mean that wasnt i mean i can see how it looks like um but nowadays i mean you can edit anything to look like um anything  so  because were dating there it is uh yeah we havent told anybody right it is going really great shut up youre taking this out on me oh really youll feel better after the k exercise is good for depression i am not depressed we have raised almost  when do they put that or is that something well a giant check costs i have a print shop standing by but what do you think michael its a tough decision i always imagined it with a giant check yeah i mean i personally am giant check it is i dont know on the other hand it does bat birth control this moneys going to bat birth control you didnt contribute very much i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor  hows that going a doctor wont come out or  if we go with the giant check  which we are there is no such thing how about a rabies nurse  i dont think so ive actually seen ads for nurses for parties and bachelor events thats possible great its gonna cost  bucks with tips maybe we should skip the ceremony and just set up have you met that kid im not going to college k means five kilometers come in  my god  you said come in  oh my god so i closed the door  baguette still burned in my eyes i can imagine come in may i enter the room yes see how i did that thats the way you should enter a room you couldnt undress in the mens room yes but i have an office on average how many hours a day  just ballpark  theyre so not i only saw where it ended  gross its the human body pam youre an artist right okay you know what i dont want this to detract from what its not fair to people with rabies and thats the point right okay they say if youre nervous around i do not recommend this strategy try picturing them with more clothes on or a funny coat im sorry is this a working office and not a french beach okay name please creed bratton  division  youre over  years old  how much is the prize money well is any of this real check that out look at me im

are plenty of things like ice skating hey kevin  about what balancing some travel receipts are you sure he wants me because i have oscar yeah no hes in the conference room awesome how long have you known the plaintiff i havent actually seen it but i have seen the firm how long have you known ms levinson six years and two months and you were directly  thats what she said thats what she said ms

you sure can you go back to where mr schneider and you were mr scott thats what she said well deliverys all wrong yeah thats what i thought did ms levinson ever say she thought it had to do with the twins  thats what i call them who are the twins to be delicate they hang off miladys chest  they make milk  her breasts she thought it had something to do yes and frankly the timing was nothing what about your romantic relationship could that have played well if it did then the company interesting because before we started dating we disclosed our relationship to hr and i have the proof right here okay the company has just  if thats okay with you would you mind please just taking a quick look at this photograph please that is you and ms levinson in jamaica and that photograph prior to the start of your relationship does that sound right mr scott the time line here please when did well depends on how you define began if it was from the first time the first time we kissed  excuse me it was

this is the way i see it yes i had sex with jan and yes i did consider jan however jan clearly did not consider me to be her boyfriend  so her actionsre completely rightful its admirable who is so obviously ambivalent thank you considering she consistently gave you that was before our relationship she was going through a divorce and she was drinking a lot okay of water mr scott this is a copy of a particularly would you mind march th and that would be a month after  is that correct you may read the highlighted portion im out of carrots im out of sticks mr scott has time and again to be an

jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off totally joking  but you should know those colors are sacred  not that i care  but if youre not a cornell man mmhmm  you probably shouldnt wear them  no i get it  i totally understand  and i just want to assure you that i mean no disrespect  you see im applying  come on you think you could get into cornell well if someone who barely outsells phyllis can get in i should be fine  im sitting right here dwight  i meant that as a compliment to you phyllis as well as a slight to andy  cornell is a good school  and i want to better myself through higher education  if it makes andy angry so be it  i have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets cool  mike you driving every weekend were gonna switch back and forth the driving  sometimes well just meet in the middle  itll be fun  wait a sec  oh i love this song  life is a highway i wanna ride it all night long if youre going my way i wanna drive you all night long ooh ooh ooh ooh if youre going my way  hey ther e  ce so uh how do you think were gonna do against penn this year nathan fords arm looks pretty strong  well hes had a pretty good season so far mmhmm  stop saying we  you did not go to cornell  okay youre just doing this to screw with me  not so  cornell is an excellent school  without its agricultural program we probably wouldnt have cabbage  at least not modern cabbage  i know its an excellent school dwight  i went there  my blood runs big red  someday well both get together in comstock hall and just laugh about all of this  hey  hey future baby sis how are you tom  nice to see you  im good  i asked tom and pete to come early so we could play a prank on jim at lunch  pretty awesome right i think theyre into the idea  theyre probably thinking that pam beesly  shes the coolest sisterinlaw on the planet  shes the best  the absolute best  okay so heres what im thinking  im gonna say that before ceramics class i took off my ring  and then when i changed back out of my smock  it wasnt in my pocket anymore and i lost it  thats perfect  you know whatd be even more hilarious remember that thing we did when jim was in high school with his girlfriend right that would be hilarious  yeah we should totally dog her about being an artist never making any money  that is awesome  like she basically has a hobby for a job  oh yeah  so not the ring then the the not doing the ring then  i think this is better   the other thing would get jim this is nice  its fun  okay okay  oh he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends  okay  they came up with that idea really fast  this trip is longer than i thought  yeah it did look shorter aah i was having a nightmare  you were sleeping you were talking bore  was i really was i saying anything interesting not really  all right whats the scoop how far four hours  almost halfway there  were only halfway halfway okay you know what i want to do i want to pull over and find a little bed and breakst for when we meet in the middle  emphasis on the bed  and the breakfast  next exit isnt for five miles  lets check there  hey guys  hey how are ya good to see you  nice to see yo

almost four women last ive dated four guys last year too  not la no  in like the last ten years  ive dated almost four women  and you are so far above them it is stupid  oh michael dont  dont  dont

be  take that down   excuse m  take  that down you know i once dated a couple guys from cornell  the were really nice  they gave me a ride home  i seriously doubt that anyone from cornell dated you  its pronounced colonel  its the highest rank in the military  its pronouncedcornell its the highest rank in the ivy league  andy lets just talk about this man to man after work  fine  yeah good   what do you say can we good  thats big red bear thats a bobble big red bear god if you leave on friday by  youll be rolling in at midnight at best  and then sleep in saturday  that only leaves us less than  hours before you have to go back again  okayokay  i will talk to you on the bluetooth the entire trip  so were talking constantly all the way  ill tell you everything that i see  everything that i pass by  things that i witness on the road  well maybe ill see an accident one weekend  how long could we keep that up years  year yeah  years of just a few hours every weekend heres my wish  i want you to meet a great guy and i want you to be happy  thank you  my wish has come true incidentally  because youve met me and you are happy  clever mike  so pam how much money does an artist make e office after they leave art school yeah not a lot of money in the arts right thats not really true  theres a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually  maybe pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin  wow thats thats a little rude  whats your deal hey jushaving fun jimmy  yeah  right pam yep  you know what i think were a great couple  i think we are a classic couple  i think were like romeo and juliet  i think we go together so wel were like peanut butter and jelly  dont you think  i do i think so  well then dont do it  please dont do this  hey whats up i just thought id try you  im thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit  i dont know what im gonna do please call me back  im not gonna be okay   please  you will  no i wont  im not strong  ill go back to jan and i hate jan  oh god you might be inter what dwight  andy ive been meaning to ask you which a cappella group should i join the harmoniacs or the doremigos assuming you had the voice to be in any of them its irrelevant  because i called admissions  and it looks like i will be conducting your university interview  thats a conflict of interest  yeah big one  so should i not let you in now  or do you want to do the interview  and then i wont let you in interview  excellent  when the hourglass strikes   then in the room whence employees confer   what okay  who are your role models if i had to put dwights chances into a percentage i would say he has nonepercent chance  so  dane cook  jack bauer  and eli whitney  youre doing great  life is a highway i wanna ride it all night  this is my niece vanessa  shes a trumpeter  and look at her  cute  that must be really fun for you and marcy huh yep she only knows how to play when the saints go marching in  i love that one  yeah but  she doesnt think shes gonna be like a career musician right here we go again  what is your deal today im just saying how many famous trumpeters can you name besides louis armstrong miles davis   one  half  the point is pam that there are jobs  dizzy gillespie  also good  and there are hobbies  i love baseball more than anything  but you dont see me trying to get on the mets  you dont  pete you couldnt make the mets  shes at pratt  you play jv baseball  will you lighten up a little bit im just calling it like i see it  i dont know if im going to make any money with art  pam dont worry about it  i mean its a very competitive field  but i have a professor who says that i have a lot of promise  and if i dont try now i never will so  guys what is going on we

president dale raymond corson  mm im sorry thats incorrect  cornells seventh president was in fact james a perkins  comprehension skills subpar  hmm interviewing skills  subpar  what are you writing you cant even give cornell your full attention  on the contrary im helping cornell by evaluating their interviewers  nobody wants that  to happen  well when they get my evaluation well see if theyre interested  applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer showing low moral character  interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process  applicant is wasting everyones time with stupid and inane accusations  interviewer has suspect motives  applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid  interviewer has turned off applicants interest in cornell  and they are going to go to the vastly superior dartmouth  ever heard of it i think i have everything i need  i think i have everything ineed  you will be hearing from the cornell application department  you will not be pleased  andyouwill not be pleased with the result  and your affiliation th cornell will end completely will end completely  that is all sir  you may go  theres another dolly in the truck mike  you could take more than that lamp  for the record i wanted to go another direction  which was way better  well ill be the judge of that  what do you got okay i lost my engagement ring in ceramics class  left it in my smock  i had this whole thing where i go back to class wrongly accuse another girl  look i even used makeup to put a ring around my finger  you can hardly see it its very subtle  that is good

friends i just want to take a minute to talk once every hour someone is involved that man is michael scott hes supporting you know what forgive me for caring right michael is a great delegator he never does any work himself and one time and his thing is so small how small is it if it were an ipod can i make in a professional roast usually the roaster will say something nice something about so

everyone he says personnel day  youre being replaced thats quite a leap i hope hes ok i feel bad give it up hes dead he just send a text whats a text you know sometimes to get perspective i like to

you did good thanks dad i spent so much of my time thinking about my old pals my college a cappella group the weird thing is now im exactly i got my dream job at cornell and im still just thinking only now theyre the i wish there was a way to know before youve someone should write you take something ordinary like a piece of paper its not much but if you see it in the right way and thats what you did but seriously you made and you couldnt once uh ohh âª i saw a friend today âª and we forgot âª but it didnt matter âª the feeling still imagine going back and you could see yourself change and make mistakes and grow up you could watch watch yourself become a father you guys gave that to me and thats an amazing gift hey jim remember flonkerton  it was awesome i still have my medal do you even have a mattress no but i still have oscar oscar i think im gay why do you say that its just that yeah but youre not gay  no but maybe the reason âª and all the faces âª have that same âª i think i must have known them how did you do it how did you capture how we felt and how we made each other laugh how did you do it also how do cameras work every day when i came into work so why in the world does it feel it all seems so very arbitrary i applied for a job at this i took a desk at the back but no matter how you get there human beings have to make that place home lets do this i just feel lucky that i my crummy story with anyone out there to take a dump youre not alone sister lets get a beer sometime im happy that this so i can remember i worked for a paper company all these that was so much fun bye kev i sold paper this my job was to speak about quantities and even if i didnt love everything i have i owe to this job this stupid wonderful boring amazing job i thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary but all in all i think an ordinary paper was a great subject theres a lot of beauty isnt that kind of the point sync and corrections by nt wwwtvsubtitlesnet
