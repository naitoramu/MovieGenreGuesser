youre probably going to hire yell at you and storm out and i think thats a big mistake i made a huge fool of myself when i thought you wanted sex that shows integrity and i was not afraid and that shows courage now i know that ive but youve got to have courage and finally when i thought i said no so there you go you got integrity and not litigious look mr zelner i knew that oh i knew that i really really want this job and i think i would be you know what i may regret this but ill give you a shot you are really thank you oh god would it be inappropriate well how about a handshake oh god

right look i wasnt trying to save ross okay my sandwich was next to ross all right i was trying to save my sandwich from a bullet  i know it doesnt make much sense look it was instinct you risked your life for a sandwich i know it sounds crazy but this is the greatest so you didnt choose ross before me no i would never do that youre like my brother  really in fact to prove how much here  thanks how good is that see what are you doing youre showing me how much with a bite jeez what are you doing here hey you know what you are in our apartment this is just a drop it doesnt matter the important youre my friend and youre here okay just a little scared the most amazing thing i thought my number was up i had an actual neardeath experience what happened we were on the ridealong with gary really

a car backfired okay why are you here i dont know how this fits but emily called you today  you talked to her but it kind of got erased i mean theres something what did she say something about having second and did you guys make and she wants you to call her wow that was a good thing yeah yes of course okay thank you thank you im gonna tell monica i was right because she didnt want not important point is okay i was right your decision right i guess i should call emily no thats not the right decision thats not right ross come on i mean that woman made you miserable do you really want okay look yesterday i wouldnt have even but my exwife calls i have a neardeath experience thats gotta mean something that was not a neardeath experience you werent there maybe this is something that okay you

a classic sign of love its also a sign of friendship not in your case lovey loverson  it was a hug did you or did you not smell her hair what if i did ninety percent of a womans thats why women are shorter so that men will fall in love come on ross i was hugging her as a friend its not my fault shes got a lot of it   coconutty what it doesnt mean maybe it means okay but be careful rachels not if the place youre   she is in the same place as me i didnt understand that maybe thats because you were a guy just called for you i dont know how about when you move in     rachels room will be empty i think we should have   with a mahogany sleigh bed and and comment cards so people could i really havent well i like that idea  obviously i was thinking maybe   you can buy old arcade games like   for

probably     yeah never oh my god then what are we even doing whoa whoa whoa is this some new strategy why dont you put down your copy you know what i gotta go its okay i got a plan were gonna find love yeah im pretty confident about that thats what makes it so easy to be would be nice to have a guarantee some people make deals with a friend like if neither of them are married you mean a backup ive got that you do who joey are you serious i locked him in years ago wait so if neither of you are yep we shook on it but believe me that is not seriously i think his exact words were    charming hes just a backup hey monica have you seen rachel its for my boat cool huh yeah its great whats the matter just realizing hes giving you a hard time i dont want to get married tomorrow   were going somewhere you know chandler not anymore maybe you changed i didnt change maybe thats the problem what one who is unlikely to take a wife does he think ill just face it and always will be well theres some people there are richard said he wants to marry you and chandler says he hates marriage chandler loves marriage you just told me he hates marriage that hes a complex fellow that hes against marriage you got that from what i said rach come on in im so sorry thanks yeah i really thought i guess it just wasnt meant to be yeah love its a tricky business isnt it i guess so so what do you say we make a pact if you and i are both single by 40 i mean we know each other   weve already slept together no like whats that oh you want me to be your backup yeah i already have one who phoebe but she just said joey is her backup oh i dont think so i just spoke with her she said thats impossible we shook on it although believe me where have you been i was making a coconut phone richard told monica

old russian expression roughly translated that means this thing that im looking at wow thank you you should see me when are you kidding you know when you dont see you build them up in your head come on dont be crazy but well you are well so are you seeing anyone no im just the worst person ever how can i not tell david maybe he didnt give you a chance he said are you seeing someone well that wouldve been your window i mean i dont know and i was just thinking hes so irresistible  really the scientist guy continue then it gets worse because i told him  phoebe i like mike so much you know isnt it ironic that david on the same day that yeah you know and given you can imagine how happy i am  what are you gonna do tell david that nothing unless i dont you know complicated moral situation  no right no wrong i knew i shouldve had this conversation funniest guy shes ever met im funny right what do you know youre a door you just like knockknock jokes save it for inside so oklahomas a crazy place you know frankly id sooner be in any other state and whats with oklahoma can all states have stuff like that hey yeah im from the waistband but when i was 7 was your cabin pressurized and dont get me started on the way okay whats with the word yall you know are we all allowed to do that you know your new poodle and fried chicken could be fricken waiter waiter excuse me see thats funny with the fricken right no it just reminds me of something i told you about that funny guy jeffrey yeah he came up well he did this bit but it was liza minnelli locked  were you there i really understand how hard its gotta be i mean its like leaving behind sandy thats exactly what it is are you gay its okay i get that a lot doing what i do but i am straight im engaged actually  her names delia so youre just like i realize how its a bit unorthodox but i really believe the most satisfying is take care of a child okay like at my last job i met daniel when he was and i got to watch him grow when i
