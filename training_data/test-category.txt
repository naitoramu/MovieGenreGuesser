second they tagged it they filed it its in the system and they locked it in their evidence room all right all right so describe the building describe the how about i describe fort knox and what are you gonna do are you gonna put on your black leotard and go dangling on a clothesline its a building full of cops what else do you need to know and why in the hell am i talking to you mike we gotta do something i am doing something hes good with this stuff okay just give him a chance now you look that laptop might as well be on the moon they build these evidence rooms like bank vaults because guess what lunatics like you wanna break into them but unlike a bank vault this is a place that is guarded  hours a day by the police theres no way youre getting it out of there who said that we have to get it out of there we just need to destroy whats on it oh so now you wanna blow up a police station i dont believe i said that no nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite now you wanna kill a bunch of cops i never said anything about killing anybody i am however considering the possibility of a device  a device  yes a small device say this device gets filed into evidence  now it is inside that room  what about a magnet you wanna commit a whole other crime just to get this bomb into evidence  who said bomb i said a device  what about a magnet an incendiary device one quick fire is all it would take you dont think they have fire suppression im not talking sprinklers im talking about halon because halon doesnt destroy evidence  a magnet though maybe like  a bomb then we plant a bomb outside oh actually i knew a crew out of fort worth that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside about all they did was take out a couple of hedges you are probably talking about  feet of reinforced concrete or what about a magnet what magnet what about it you know just so what do you think expensive leaving aside engineering rigging some kind of alternate power source my primary sticking point is i actually need the thing as you gentlemen can see its paying the bills but i mean its feasible doable hey were living in a time of string theories and god particles feasible doable yeah sure why not expensive what would you put it in what about that does it run we can get it running whats the box made of plywood and aluminium just what you need all right so you wanna talk money step into my office hey listen i dont actually have any money right now my wife theres an irs issue anyway id appreciate it if you could spot me my share ill pay you back yeah whatever right you coming if you have any brains youll take that money you saved and youll skip town today right now you dont think this can work is that a serious question mike this is a threeman job the only way i
