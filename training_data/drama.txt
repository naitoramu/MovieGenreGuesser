schoolteacher  how do you explain it no one saw me whoever sold it to you did and thats not the point im waiting for your unemployment i asked for an extension  because on paper we have no money im not apologizing for wanting im not asking you to apologize walt im asking you to be smart i bought one bottle of champagne one single bottle skyler i paid cash thats it thats all it takes okay one piece of duct tape on a door brought down  what im nixon now what im saying is one little mistake that could ruin us fine gotta destroy the evidence and when i look at this image i am very concerned about whether its from but especially signage thats thank you any other questions we have a motion and a second all those in favor raise your hand theres four in the affirmative theres five nos and the i would like to make a motion and the findings of the ebc and the motion then is seconded i see none all those in favor signify all those in favor theres five in the affirmative theres four in the negative  you want me to open the doors here the keys take them why you talking no no no no gambling destroyed my life me my family everything i loved it was like a robbery its amazing the stories you tell the lies that lead you one more roll of the dice this is our deal okay marie no you guys are not lifting a finger yeah were bringing everything so great sweetie dont worry were not we just wanna bring everyone all right ill see you soon bye so tonights the night no turning back well okay lets do this okay so first i assign point values correlate to the effect of removal  youre gonna split the eights now the mathematical principle upon which i devised not dissimilar to the mit system walt youre not teaching them  you wanted me to be thorough you dont think it behooves me it behooves you to be a pro thats all dont chopchop me now we both know is whether or not to split on eights split them good on both next decision is whether  which you should be doing okay this hand over here the final decision is whether or not  becomes a hard  i see that hit it okay lets see what i got and   damn okay the key thing to remember here the key is the number of hands lets go again zero minus one  okay  walt i certainly more than understand lets just keep going no you know what i shouldnt even be playing and that is the fiction you know what youre right yeah okay all right lets get started  walt we got a lot of ground to cover we have to get our story straight  a script bullet points we got a novella this is smart you really wanna try fullofholes story have enough money  am i supposed to memorize this  we need to be wordperfect we need this story to be solid and sympathetic the story that you already told marie you think that she hasnt told hank come on this is marie no she hasnt she hasnt hank thinks his insurance is paying maries not telling him  and neither are we  really did you take money walt i seem to recall that  fine and at least well have laid and coming clean with hank appearing to come clean we talked about this  okay we agreed about this what never mind just okay so i really think we should well each be responsible for certain we can hand off so we dont leave okay so im gonna launch that we are buying a car wash the next logical question where are you getting the money we wanna tell you the whole story so hold onto your hats do you like that sure it accomplishes two things it keeps to expect something big yeah no its a doozy okay anyway thats where you will pages one and two okay and its its pretty much gonna run parallel but just make sure really touch on the fear and despair its good to remind them we want them to understand why now after that per pages three gambling became an addiction  do you see that in the middle okay i put in that line about robbery so next ill chime in about how starting with the confusion the im terribly terribly ashamed  yeah  its to show contrition i would never say phrase it however you want okay and why do i really need to answer that i was and am  lets just pick up where we left off this makes me look like crap this has to be a wartsandall story thats how well sell it how do you look bad exactly where is the i slept with my boss i cant seem to find that anywhere for a fired schoolteacher id say youre coming out i dont like it at least you won at gambling im the im sorry im sorry hows that sound two sorry s i believe we were on page five so after you say how very sorry you were almost to the end and then i say how proud i am of you and this is where i think we should just a suggestion

so this little dingus here by a big international concern i call their houston office i get through i use the schrader sweettalk six months ago one of these systems who signed for it gale boetticher so i asked my new girlfriend who they have no record that anybody so i go back and push more the temps gone im talking to some snotnose lawyer brick wall so i take a peek now madrigal but theyre industrial equipment global shipping and a tiny little foothold specifically a local chain polios hermanos okay so what right i got no line or where his lab was the whole things a snipe hunt but now i get this crazy idea and i cant shake it i mean i stay up nights trying to make sense of it i told you boettichers vegan were talking this guy or whatever the hell that is whats a vegan doing maybe hes meeting somebody like who well like maybe this guy i mean what do we know this whole could be a case of keep your hes got the money maybe hes got the connections too hes our guy hank no offense if

hell live now thank me and shake my hand  thank you thank you again guys guys hurry up  can we go now whats happening eight fortythree time of death  burn in hell you piece of shit one of the gunmen died the second succumbed to his wounds agents with the dea and fbi in conjunction with apd are working in an attempt to identify i can give you the highlights your nephews grew impatient they continued to press me when i wouldnt give it they settled but a phone call was placed to agent schrader thus giving him the upper hand marco was shot in the face leonel lingered for several hours the warning call to the dea agent juan bolsa into who placed it yesterday and in the confusion an accident perhaps a mistake made by his own men though we may never know at any rate this is what comes so is this the loud one what i can never remember is this the loud machine no this is the petct scan positron emission tomography theyve paired that quiet no magnets right okay yeah thanks im still pretty new at this one minute my wife and i walk into a doctors office  i mean life as i know it yes im waiting on the thing we discussed anyway so for me letting go giving up control you know its

residue here is why we descale from the walkin do it again please polios hermanos where something yes detective yeah  gustavo thanks for coming  hows kathi  and you know hank schrader  and steve gomez agent schrader and i had a chance id eat there every day  well should we get started  id like to record this conversation the dea is working on an investigation so ive asked them to sit in gus we all appreciate your coming but you have the right oh well i cant see but then so you wish to continue please im very anxious sir your fingerprints were found really thats surprising a drugrelated homicide gale boettichers apartment so you knew the victim fifteen years ago i established i named it a dear friend of mine gale was a recipient he was perhaps one of three dozen i see and mr boetticher graduated in   and you kept in contact with him oh no i hadnt seen gale for years  ran into him where well ran into isnt quite accurate he came by to reestablish contact he invited me to dinner it was perhaps a week later  drug related you said the paper made no mention of that i assumed so after years with no contact  and invites you to dinner  gale boetticher asked for money he spoke in terms but it was my suspicion yes he was a very very talented chemist he was more interested than what would or could have been personal shortcomings he was a warm gentle person and i thought a lot of him at any rate and after can you tell us where you were on the night of wednesday the rd  not an accusation just a question twentythird i was at a fundraiser i was there from  to about  anyone else sorry yeah just one other thing is gustavo fring your real name is it my real name i know youre a chilean national but there are no records of you really i mean records show that you and years later you were granted but theres no record of gustavo fring which i find i dont know strange well no really it isnt pinochets government first and foremost but it was also notoriously unreliable im sure if you keep digging okay i think thats it gus i hope that i was of some small help  you were absolutely thank you good to see you again oh no  no please please dont get up gentlemen so are we buying this thing with his name sure the recordkeeping i mean we run into that all the time but we usually find something if state department wasnt satisfied well maybe state just wasnt as tough i dont know what this has to do i was curious when his print showed up for me the scholarship explains it ill admit to a certain degree of bias this man has been a longtime friend but that being said well i agree still why are we hearing it now what do you mean well like you said hes a this man hes reading the newspaper and sees someone he thought a lot of he reads this didnt call you to share his connection with the case we cant predicate on a person what do you think tim well i wanna follow up but my overall impression i believed him nice touch birdbath  hey tiger hows it hanging yeah so very nice whats the damage twelve hundred a month  thats a pretty good deal speaking of which thats for the week plus theres a little extra in there thank you  hey champ hows the new school i loved school when i was

was just speculation and guess what i find chicken mans fingerprints  so we bring him in killed gale boetticher probably not these guys usually get a dunce but his fingerprints being there so you brought him in to the police right he sits down to talk with us what did you ask him walt sorry im just all right whatever so we bring him in okay hes got an explanation hes got an alibi for gales murder this guy so hes not guilty yeah as far as dea officially frings not a suspect but im telling you something deep down says just gotta prove it hank why are you telling me this i need a favor

whatever man im gonna take a piss i think you got a phone call anything important  yes  and nor the apd considers you schrader is looking into you  a voice in the wilderness just him his credit card hed be committing career suicide if he  no warrant for that tracking device the guy has gone totally maverick we watch our backs hell never make a case  what about chile i seriously doubt schrader can

of them well its the grandparents polka hello hector the cartel has given me to which ive said no dea agent schrader hes a concern hes looking into my past is today the day hector gustavo sit down its a good plan trust yourself everything is going to be okay are you crazy the boss is gonna rip your balls off what you gonna tell and you they aint gonna say nothing they like what they see youre not going to offer who says theyre guests if the boss wants them to drink they drink so the chicken brothers i like your restaurant dark meat and white meat dont look like no brothers to me at last the master chefs you two that chicken you cook i swear it has got to be the tastiest thank you don eladio its a great honor max is the chef the compliments are all his gustavo is too modest thered be no restaurant without him well however you two do it keep it up your chicken its so zesty piquant but it does not taste its a recipe i learned in chile which ive modified a bit i bet we like a little more chili we mexicans like a good hard kick so if your partner is the chef then who are you dont tell me you are just the taster i handle the business operations gustavo is a brilliant businessman es el businessman good good but tell me something that chicken so fabulous so excellent besides that what else we have several side dishes rice beans sometimes we prepare if we come across fresh beef anything else come on be honest there is nothing else you offer something on the side because when i send my men they come back they come back with drugs regresan high you are selling them narcotics methamphetamine with all due respect don eladio i didnt sell it to them i gave them samples samples some businessman i gave them samples to give to you to introduce you to our product don eladio gustavo meant no offense but he that is to say we could think of no other way we want to work with you don eladio i know all about methamphetamine thats poor mans cocaine only bikers and hillbillies use it theres no money in it may i don eladio i am a biochemist by training the methamphetamine we make to the socalled biker crank it is crystallized like glass purer and the chirality of the molecule its very structure is different the narcotic effect is far more potent this product is the drug of the future itll triple your profits perhaps quadruple theyre not only good cooks theyre great at shoveling manure right now you deal almost exclusively but the coca plant cant grow you are no more than middlemen for the colombians they cut you a percentage for but the lions share despite your assumption this new crystal methamphetamine its stronger which means but most importantly we can show you right here in mexico and you keep all the profits my men do like your product hector what is wrong with you why did you not get glasses go on you are quite the talent i bet you learned cooking but what about the chemistry i studied at the university of santiago gustavo paid for my education oh really i have degrees in both biochemistry with minimal capital investment we can set up train your own people of highly pure methamphetamine fantastic tell me one thing though if youre the cook why do i need him se√£or you businessman why should i negotiate with someone who insults me by dealing who manipulates me into a meeting in front of my own men what do i need you for don eladio please i didnt sell anything i apologize if you are offended by my method i merely took the initiative i meant no insult don eladio i know gustavo like a brother hes an honorable man the most loyal man i have ever known he rescued me he made me the man i am today gustavo is a genius just find it in your heart to forgive him please hes my partner i need him i swear to god look at him you did this to him now look at him listen to me the only reason you are alive is because i know who you are but understand you are not in chile anymore my advice stick to chicken look at me hector look at me maybe next time  i got it i got it youre like a bee at a damn picnic  morning  ready to get your rocks on mineral show is just some sort of yeah you got your singles  got it dont let him get too crazy okay cram one more giant geode in here  got it i got it christ longest week ever heres just hoping keep your fingers crossed relax buddy this aint no spy movie its more like rocky you know get

dont want you to worry okay im going to figure out here so is he gonna kill him is who gonna kill who gus is he gonna kill mr whites i mean hes the reason because its totally logical for him ahole dea agent who needs that right makes sense to get rid of him but killing a cop i dont know it could look suspicious if the dude whos investigating you then theres theres mr white who would be even more apeshit hed never cook for gus again guess theres a lot of angles if something were to happen to him who really cares what i think son of a bitch you get comfortable kid hey get down tell them the answer is yes  should i even ask so what is this going to be meth cooking and corpse disposal just grab us a spare barrel what was it this time what did this poor bastard do or did gus need to send shut your mouth you shut your mouth i dont want you talking to me and if you ever plan on calling you go ahead and get two barrels like i guess i never thanked you for thanks next time dont stand there move your feet but seriously what  what was the deal with gus that terminator shit what the hell was he doing the cartel needs gus his distribution network but what the rest of us are like is he doing anything about that  for target practice while he enough you got questions and here again unreported income thats more than a year straight so far you want to say something about this id have to have a look at the copies of take all the time you need oh i am so sorry i am late i got lost hey ted  sky there are doors everywhere  hi you are special skyler white ms white for many of these

should i sit down okay so okay so word has come down they want me to go to mexico theres some  between gus and the cartel the cartel has been has been like jacking trucks to and yesterday i mean they shot him right in some sniper nailed him from anyway theyve been holding but between the cartel and your brotherinlaw trying its like what you call so gus is ls gonna cave so the cartel wants half and they want your formula well i i gotta give it to them i mean and teach a bunch of cartel chemists you know so i gotta go you know not me you know go over there and they got like actual chemists like cartel chemists asking me that i dont know how to and what if all the equipment you know i mean if i mess this up im dead you know all of us mr white look i need okay maybe you could or something you

walt please call me walt why the hell are we making meth tell me with the phenylacetic acid solution you said  drops per minute for the first  minutes and then  for the remainder why is that my thinking is by tapering the phenyl oilier aqueous layer and hence better benzene extraction exactly but actually i prefer ether ill have it for tomorrow im wondering how you ended up here actually im still wondering but yes i mean i cant imagine we strike each other as criminals theres crime and then theres crime i suppose im definitely a libertarian consenting adults and if im not supplying it at least with me theyre getting no added toxins or adulterants yeah i was doing it pursuing my doctorate at colorado nsf research grant i was on my way jumping through hoops attending to all the nonchemistry that one finds oneself you know that world that is not what i signed on for i love the lab because its all still magic you know chemistry once you lose that it is it is magic it still is and all the while i kept thinking about that great old whitman poem when i heard walt whitman i i dont know it anyway well can you recite it pathetically enough i could all right well come on when i heard the learnd astronomer when the proofs the figures were ranged in columns before me when i was shown the charts to add divide and measure them when i sitting heard the with much applause how soon unaccountable i became tired and sick till rising and gliding out i wanderd off by myself in the mystical moist nightair and from time to time lookd up in perfect silence at the stars i am a nerd  bravo come on pinkman you little rat bastard get off  hey baby  im working all right the rv nope working on it so why cant you just arrest him make him tell you its not that simple the constitution blah blah blah this kid i swear to god this is that pinkman character thats the one positive the little bastard and i just dont know until he actually leads me or does something sorry not to bring up

all right you hear me i got nothing to say you had my cell phone number howd you do it talk if youre ready to talk they want to get a statement your side of what happened here or we can hold him off maybe youll want to talk there it is yo adrian rocky called come on you see that thats your get out of jail free card just blink once if youre following the das worst nightmare is that face out in public theyre going to have to steer for fear of the pr poop storm if this story ever gets out i mean this beating best thing for you youre home free good right right youre now officially paul meet ringo i am so sorry for this this should not have happened but it did no thanks to you but the plan did work we would have been locked up this i just i never saw this coming what happens now what

he turns im going to be there grabbing my share hell be scrubbing toilets and ill be standing over him to get my cut hell see me when he wakes up and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat holes left for him after i shred his house down i will haunt his crusty ass forever until the day he sticks a gun up his mouth and pulls the trigger just to get me out of his head thats what happens next my advice thats probably not a good strategy theyre scared of you right now but if you hit them theyre forced to hit back hard they will turn over every rock until someone spills and anyone associated with you present company included yes i think what saul is saying move on with your life leave it behind all of it nothing changes once i walk out of here i get myself a new rv how exactly do you think youre going to get away with that they will catch you so what i have a get out of jail free card i may have overstated the the power of your face not this if the cops catch me i give them what they want the most you they nab me i make a deal to give up the great heisenberg and his milliondollar drug ring youre my free pass bitch youre so sure look if he didnt give up my name hes never going to talk what do you think that was he wants your brotherinlaw and theres going to be a many lawyers id take it myself if it wouldnt and him cooking again when not if he gets caught and hes facing  years whatll he do then theres no honor among thieves except for us of course no hell hell come around and if he doesnt there may come a time options im convinced that mr pinkman and distribution specifically what were calling i tracked him to a scrap yard where he stored an rv while waiting for a warrant which i believed to be i received a telephone call telling me my wife marie had been injured in an accident upon hearing the news i left mr pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife after arriving at the hospital my wife fortunately was unharmed so i immediately went back but the rv was gone most likely destroyed on site and it was at this point that you drove i think were done here agent schrader needs to get home get some rest thats fine but just to confirm  youre taking the fifth here we just want mr pinkman is pressing charges hes given a detailed version of events as he sees them  the word of a meth head were well aware but toxicology on pinkman his blood is clean hes not using the kid is even refusing as far as we can tell where do we go from here a couple of gentlemen probably tomorrow morning janice will give us and you men will be  thanks for your time we just need one more thing photo of agent schraders hands for the record yes of course bandage off if you would on the table is fine flat on the table is fine its all going to work out youve been too good to

about what happened yes i know whatever hank was investigating him trying to find an rv is there any danger that could lead back to you why would it is this why youre here im here to talk about hank

its important that were talking about and even then the odds but you cant know for sure when does he start physical therapy weve sent the paperwork its high priority we should have preauthorization certainly by early next week next week no thats not going to do it ive looked into this the sooner physical therapy begins the better his chances are he needs daily sessions isnt that right actually your plans treatment program actually she asked the doctor planwise four sessions and the therapists in your mostly fine okay look if hank had with better therapists wouldnt it be more its very hard to say marie is the health plans way is it absolutely optimal you know screw it ill make sure he gets what he needs mrs schrader i get your but my best advice is dont go out of pocket physical therapy is were talking nursing care modifications to your home occupational therapy it could run into the hundreds so what were just supposed to well if you dont follow the they may never pay you back ive seen patients and waiting to be reimbursed who is the best physical i can give you some names but theyre not likely to hell with the plan there he is finally i went ahead ladies this is jessesan kick

hell live good im glad walter you seem troubled how can i help you i asked to see you in order to clear the air there are some issues that could cause a misunderstanding and i think its in our best interest to lay the cards on the table thats the best way to do business my brotherinlaw moments before he was attacked someone called to warn him i believe that same those two men the assassins i believe i was their prime target but that somehow they to my brotherinlaw because of this intervention i am alive and yet i think that this person was playing a much deeper game he made that phone call not a silent assassination in one stroke he bloodied both sides set the american against the cartel and cut off the supply if this man on this side of the border he would have the market to himself the rewards would be enormous were both adults i cant pretend i dont i want there to be no confusion i know i owe you my life and more than that i respect the strategy in your position i wouldve done the same one issue which troubles me i dont know what happens when our threemonth contract ends what would you like to happen you know why i do this i want security for my family then you have it three million for three months that was our agreement extended annually twelve million a year call it fifteen openended would that be agreeable part of the reason we talk about in our daily lives is to help each other put a finger head off our disease anyone free license to bitch and moan jesse last time you seemed pretty down let me ask you something if you had what would you do make more green man a lot more forget about money i dont know i guess i would make something like what not that it even matters but work with my hands i guess building things like carpentry or brick laying i took this votech class wood working i took a lot of votech classes but this one time i had this teacher name of mr pike i guess he was like a marine he was hard of hearing my project for his class was to make this wooden box you know like a small just like a like a box you know to put stuff in so i wanted to get the thing done i figured i could cut classes and he couldnt flunk me you know made the thing so i finished it in a couple days it looked pretty lame you know so when i showed it to mr pike for my grade he looked at it and said is that the best you can do at first i thought to myself now give me a d and shut up so i can go blaze one i dont know maybe it was the way it was like he was just asking me honestly is that all you got and for some reason yeah man i can do better so i started from scratch i made another then another and by the end of the semester i had built this thing you shouldve seen it i built it out of peruvian walnut with inlaid zebrawood it was fitted with pegs no screws i sanded it for days then i rubbed all the wood rich and dark it even smelled good you know you put your nose in it and breathed in it was it was perfect what happened to the box i gave it to my mom nice you know what im going to say its never too late they have art coops adult extension program you know i traded it for an ounce of weed hes a hero theyll say no im agreeing with you

will all take it because he is a hero and he is not going to be i know but if theres every anything at all its good to have you here both of you i just wish there was something more that we could do we can always pay their bills please we have the money more than enough walt earned it i think marie should know the truth skyler i really dont think  i think that walt and i weve had our problems lately and what it all came down to money pure and simple when walt was diagnosed it it changed him looking back i dont think what it was it was more than facing death it was knowing nothing and so thats how this all started he wanted to provide and so he paid his medical bills i thought that elliot and gretchen yeah i thought so too but the truth is he was too proud to take isnt that right he put his mind to it and you know how walt is hes a problem solver and he read books and he did a whole and he came up with this system a system a system for counting cards what do you mean like rain man i dont pretend to understand but he was convinced hed have a god what is it a statistical edge yes statistical so he walt was at some and at first he went to the casinos but then he realized that but then he realized that the casinos report and if it gets reported and if you do not want then you find another place like an illegal backroom game you remember all those long walks all that time he used to spend away from home i guess for a couple months there sort of leading a double life your fugue state was that some sort of cover he did not fake that marie the night that walt disappeared he lost  it was his pension fund our savings basically every last dime gone he couldnt live with it he was suicidal but you have to understand that as soon as he got out he went right back to gambling i mean thats how deep this went how could you do that to her walt anyway this system of his he finally got it to work so all this is to say we have the money no more gambling but we have the money how much money its in the seven figures holy mary mother of god what can i say i did very well you will take our money use it to take care of hank please marie let us help  does walt jr know about this and i need to keep it that way and hanks got enough so can we just please i just i need to well talk about it later how did you come up with that i mean where did you possibly i learned from the best somehow something tells me that hank is here because of you and im not forgetting that  hush little baby dont say a word mamas gonna buy you a mockingbird and if that mockingbird wont sing mamas gonna buy you a diamond ring if that diamond ring turns brass mamas gonna buy you a looking glass so hush little baby dont you cry daddy loves you and so do i subtitles wwwsoustitreseu mamas gonna buy you

back when it was my aunts house back before she died of cancer possum big freakylooking bitch since when whats up with that it was just possum opossum makes it sound why they gotta go changing whatever giant pinktailed rats totally freaky like alien rats actually its not so much but he was living there you could hear him going from always scurrying around sometimes id see him and he would just you know freeze and its like youre not i mean it thinks its fooling you thats what they do its just so lame is there a discernible point a point that youll be arriving at sometime in the near future it was just a total bitch a guy came set all these traps and all and he finally got it but my aunt she didnt believe it she kept insisting i mean you could not tell her she started keeping an old umbrella by her chair man she would just bang even gave it a name it was scrabble yeah that was it scrabble just knock it off she got like that toward the end got obsessive about stuff just got mad about stuff we didnt know what was up it wasnt like her to be that way but it turned out that the the cancer had spread to her brain and that was why it metastasized but it was good to take her to the doctor we knew what was up and got her some treatment and meds so she wasnt stressing it was a lot better after that she was a lot happier where the hell is he ive been to my oncologist jesse just last week im still in remission im healthy good great no end in sight thats great i missed it there was some perfect moment and it passed me right by yeah i had to have enough that was the whole point none of this makes any sense but it had to be skyler it had to be before that perfect moment for what to drop dead what are you saying im saying ive lived too long you want them to actually miss you you know you want their memories of you but she just wont she just wont understand no matter how well i explain it these days she just has this this i mean i truly believe there exists there must exist certain words in a certain specific order that would explain all of this but with her i just i just cant ever seem to find them mr white i was thinking maybe but before the fugue state so no not then and plus my daughter it had to be after holly was born definitely before the surgery oh christ that damn second cellphone how could i possibly i know the moment it was the night jane died i was at home and and we needed diapers and so i said id go but it was just an excuse actually that was the night i i brought you your money remember yeah i remember but afterward i stopped at a bar it was odd i just walked in sat down i never told you that you went to a bar i sit down and this man he engages me in conversation now hes a complete stranger but he turns out donald margolis what are you talking about i didnt know it at the time i mean i didnt put it together when he was all over the news janes dad think of the odds once i tried to calculate them but theyre astronomical think of the odds of me going in sitting down that night in that bar what did you talk about water on mars family what about family i told him that i had a daughter and he told me he had one too then he said never give up on family and i didnt i took his advice the universe is random its not inevitable its simple chaos its subatomic particles thats what science teaches us but what is this saying what is it telling us that this mans daughter dies its me whos having how can that be random sit down that was the moment that night i should never have left home never gone to your house maybe things would have thought i was i was at home watching tv some some nature program about elephants skyler and holly i could hear them she was singing a lullaby if had just lived and not one second more  that wouldve been perfect hes not coming down must be thailandhot up there thats why he likes it thailands hot right yeah see thats why wait here hes not coming down hes staying up there forever what are you doing

you know how that is sure do you mind would you slice the garlic very thin why did you invite me here were working together why not break bread together now the garlic it always amazes me the way the senses i mean this stew is simply taken separately these ingredients not very much at all but in this precise combination the smell of this meal instantly it brings me back to my childhood how is that possible basically it all takes place neural connections are formed the senses make the neurons express signals that go right back to the same part where memory is stored thats something called relational memory dont quote me on that im rusty on my biology thats very interesting i would like to help you help me how when i first started out more than i care to admit i wish id had someone to advise me because this life of ours it can overwhelm you are a wealthy man now and one must learn to be rich to be poor anyone can manage what advice do you have for me never make the same mistake

could you keep an eye on your sister  thanks  bye son good work today have you thought anymore thought any more so show me the flaw in it flaws skyler flaws plural not singular where do you want me to start i dont love that you put me in however lets just stick you took the seed money you invested it in the car wash you hired your wife as a bookkeeper shes actually a bookkeeper now that is a story an auditor can youre missing that you should just and not look too closely at it so if god forbid i get caught you maintain plausible deniability okay my estranged husband who when he was working made  a year starts shoveling money at me im supposed to say gee i never thought about it officers really that in your mind ill tell you what walt id rather have them think than some complete idiot so youre promoting caution here and you want a believable story that it seems to me is the safest way to make the best out of a very bad situation yes but im noting a little hole in your plot though why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you because he loves his family and desperately wants though it may be hopeless and futile then again hed try anything im just not buying it no i think it would be better if the husband were you know maybe if he were back its suddenly a fantasy story i am at least going to be dinner with the family not every night no six nights a week dinner two nights not weekends with hours notice five nights a week with no notice three sixhours notice five nights a week four dont push it and i want my own key to the house for emergencies i am going to babysit ill help my son with his homework i am going to be and that is how well sell how about we stop somewhere no thanks though maybe some other time no seriously get a beer with me what what the hell are you doing thats ours right look at it and tell me yes its ours what the hell is wrong with you where did you get that i bought it from the two guys they had combo shot down and now its our product theyre selling which means they work what is that  do you have any proof who shot him hear how i just said kid this kid hes  years old shot combo on orders these two scumbags they got him and you know hes not the first they use kids cause hey why not easy to control easy to fool all they get is juvie hearts and minds right get them young these guys killed combo they used this little kid like some puppet they used him to shoot my friend so why are you telling me this i need your help how i need ricin my god god these two they got to go ive got the entire a delivery method everything is the poison thats all look otherwise you dont have to listen you dont even know look you you dont get how the whole  would be better off i know a woman who buys from the she brings them hamburgers cause and they get hungry and they knock theres your delivery system  i can be a mile away a methhead you know what that methhead all right she didnt give it up you know how it is you know because youre not i know i would be prison or worse and id you cannot be serious listen this is a ridiculous idea its ridiculous what so youre saying how about back back when you were apples and oranges guy eats ricin two or three days later or a heart attack or something thats what you said untraceable back to us to me not even that other scumbag we work for it was a good plan and its a good plan now tuco wanted to murder us these guys dont apples and oranges do i really have to sit here and explain the difference to you combo was us man he was one of us does that mean nothing why didnt you go after these guys  two or three months ago whats to find out its a dispute over turf right for you to track them down on their turf and kill them months ago because back then you were too busy getting high feeling sorry now murder is not part of your step program this is not some amends what you are talking this achieves nothing it accomplishes nothing if you dont see then theres no way jesse listen to me you are not a murderer im not and youre not its as simple as that im doing it with or without you knock knock christ sakes marie  like that thats not the rules  listen you knock your way groucho but look see not so fast christ again frickin paul newman over here do you play cards with your dadhave you been playing cards no why how is your old man  he back teaching i dont think either right now how they swinging that did you know that the doctor has told your uncle  any time he wants to thats great yeah well why not what thats what they said thats what they said they hit the sheets

crutches maybe i should be in here too  is that what youre trying to say deal you little prick bitch you know im hourly right he promised me hed be here oh he promised huh lets wait then thats a joke okay so whats plan b i dont know i really dont well lets brainstorm  you really think hes serious the way he was talking or try at least okay so what we pay him off no no its not about money its about getting him getting him to calm down maybe what if we maybe could you get him arrested you want your criminal associate no now listen i know it sounds risky that would get him into real trouble and nothing that could lead just some minor offense pinkman in jail i dont know  im picturing it and as in jail jail im talking about one of those situations where youre picking up litter along the highway thats jail youre talking something that keeps him off  days tempers have cooled roswell correctionals in the past hearing chancy things since they renovated so so its possible right it falls under but you can afford that ill call my pi you understand what you have to do you can never talk to anyone right i mean ever yeah i found this stuff on the internet takes days to kick in just keep quiet youre okay with this right just think of it like youre just delivering its not just delivering hamburgers you got a kid right whats his name patrick imagine these two guys and patrick working as a mule making him kill people wouldnt you do anything of course i would i do all kinds of things for him okay so these guys using kids like that they got to go right good tomorrow ill be in touch bet that tastes good huh come here here we go here we go what are you doing if you need to talk use the phone this isnt a phone talk walter your wifes out right isnt she something i got a granddaughter what can i do for you have a seat walter i spoke to goodman about pinkman  and why because its moronic saul said youve done things thats not the moronic part okay so whats the problem the problem is saul my boss your boss this is a professional courtesy no one knows im here but our employer would and if pinkman were arrested you got a good thing going here you want to risk it all now i realize you two but this kids been its a long time coming what is i used to be a beat cop and id get called out on hundreds probably over the years but there was this one guy this one gordie he looked like bo svenson walking tall anyway big boy   but his wife or whatever she was his lady was real small like a bird anyway my partner and i get and one of us would pull her come on tonights the night and this wasnt one of those deep we got a lot of those but not this this girl was scared she wasnt going to cross him nothing we could do put him in the car throw him in the drunk tank he sleeps it off back home but one night my partners out sick and its just me and the call comes in brokennoseintheshower so i cuff him put him in the car only that night were driving into town and this sideways asshole is in my back seat and it just rubbed me wrong so instead of left i go right out into nowhere and i kneel him down and i told him this is it this is how it ends and hes crying swearing to god screaming as much as you can and i told him to be quiet cause i need to think about and of course he got quiet goes still and real quiet like a dog waiting then we just stood there me acting and prince charming with shit in his pants and after a few minutes i took and i say so help me i will such and such and blah blah blah blah blah just a warning of course just trying to do the right thing but two weeks later he killed her of course caved her head in with the we got there there was so much the moral of the story is i chose a half measure when i should have gone all the way ill never make that mistake again no more half measures walter man i dont get this i dont get this at all all im seeing is the kid so where are they i dont know theyre always around burgers are getting cold so is it like fast dont sweat it all right nobodys going to know anything can i have another bump you had your bump we get this thing done going to need you to come with me take a walk where are we going sit down i

right here right now you told him wait outside listen to me you have one friend in this room this man those men outside are my trusted employees and when i learned if it wasnt for this man and the respect i have for him i would be dealing with this you dont look at him this is what happens now my men will come back inside and you will shake their hands and you will make peace and that will be the end of this pardon me they use kids these assholes of yours doing their killing for them youre supposed to be some kind this how you do business you okay with this you got anything to say here bring them back no more children understand and you you keep the peace say it ill keep the peace shake hands jesse your actions they affect other people and sometimes compromises have to be made for the best of reasons let the people who get the people who get paid to so i guess this is just lying in a hospital bed getting sponge baths from nurses its time to go home hank how many times i got to

to the  representing the abq what up beyotch so the term chiral derives from the greek word now the concept here just as your left hand are mirror images identical and yet opposite well so too as mirrorimage forms all the way down but although they may they dont always for instance uh im sorry thalidomide the the righthanded isomer is a perfectly fine to give to a pregnant woman but make the mistake of giving the lefthanded isomer and her child will be born which is precisely so chiral chirality mirrored images right active inactive good bad uh so yes ben is this gonna be what is this gonna be uh chirality on the midterm no no well maybe but prepare for it cant hurt to know it right knowledge is power oh no oh no no no not good what the hey hey hey you hey listen you no no no no oh

up one last sale this is providing he doesnt decide every time we bring in a new batch so as his head is down so three shots three shots or i dont know two two would probably work i guess two in the chest in the face im just trying to understand okay but by now the big guy gonzo hes probably coming at you right you turn toward him how many shots for him how many shots does that take i dont know three shots okay tuco and gonzo now is there anyone else there i mean tuco is usually maybe even a couple of guys all right so well put a pin in that one too at this point how many shots fired youve

key im not stupid i did not its faulty is this just a genetic thing with you did your mother drop you the buzzer did not buzz and youre the one yes i see your point your imbecility being what it is jesse dont leave the keys i wanted to leave them oh im sorry oh the workstation jesus all right so we need okay how you gonna be okay oh damn it whats it taste like bad huh this is good okay there here red to red black to black positive negative what the hells wrong you have to really pull no really pull not like a girl you know what pull this it just needs to warm up a little oh my god oh jeez well done jesse as always just well done god come on you bitches hear me now damn it stupid okay now we have to use this is ruined do you understand you hooked it up wrong no no no how do you know what i know is that i wasnt the one thats what i know excuse me for thinking on my feet is that what you were now that we have you and thinking look somebody is going to your wife is not gonna notice mr white come on god all right look just make it snappy roaming drains the battery yo skinny hey yeah yeah listen man now all right were stuck out here look pencils fine retard just something to write with all right so you ready all right so youre gonna head west and youre gonna go past the casino all right they light up and blink then youre gonna wanna take it slow its right before the white sign now youre gonna be way way out like crazy far so just keep heading about another  miles really that far all right just go down that road i mean were way the hell out here oh and yo hey listen leave now here hes coming there was this guy who broke his leg and he had to drink urine for you know he said it tasted like really hot look we should just call you know ill be quick just be like all right come on yo yo where are you oh so you saw the white sign yes hes almost here oh man all right so youre on the dirt road hes on the dirt road good good you just crossed the river wait wait what river yeah hey yo what river what the hell river you talking about hey yo pete yo pete can you phones dead now what mr white what now oh come on seriously whats this im trying to tricklecharge the battery seriously just by turning that thing the commutator its the part usually this little piston engine but considering that its lying here anyway apply a little elbow grease itll take longer a lot longer but theoretically it should work theoretically it has to work you understand can i try yeah how much longer i dont know now hey mr white hey yeah yo man you hanging in yeah im good its gotta be ready by now right no give it a little longer just to make sure were methylamine doesnt spoil does it no thats not why were here yo lie much here push okay okay okay now go on please please please yes yes come on damn no please god no god please please why couldnt i have just gone why why mr white mr white what are you doing mr white oh god i have this coming what i have it coming i deserve this hey snap out of it all right first off everything you did right all i ever managed to do was worry and disappoint them and lie oh god all the lies i cant even i cant even keep them straight you know what screw this im walking you can come or not wheres my other shoe jesse jesse your body is running dangerously low sodium potassium calcium and when theyre gone your brain ceases to communicate your lungs stop breathing you go marching out there and within an hour okay you need to cut out and think of something scientific something what come on man you made poison out of beans yo all right look we got we got an entire lab right here how about you take and mix up some rocket fuel and we can just send up or you make some kind of robot or a homing device or build a new battery or or wait no what if we just take some stuff and build it into something you know like a and that way what hey what is it what do you have any money change i mean coins yeah i got a bunch from the yes and washers and nuts and bolts and whatever little pieces of metal it has to be galvanized or solid zinc solid zinc okay bring me brake pads the front wheels should have discs okay brake pads okay what are we building you said it yourself a battery move this doesnt look like any battery well trust me it is a battery or rather one cell of a battery here cut up the last two sponges remember the electrolytes well think about it a battery is a galvanic cell its no more than an anode separated by an electrolyte right right here on one side and graphite this is the cathode this is where the supply of current then here ill show you on the opposite side is our anode this its zinc its what we find in our coins so the sponge is the electrolyte well no the potassium hydroxide but yes thats what im soaking good good and now what shall we use to conduct what one particular element wire copper oh i mean right the only question now is and how many cells will we need weve only got material enough okay put the lid on wait positive all right cathode anode damn that is good that is very good come on attention passengers with your personal belongings any bags left unattended hows the its fine i know i can trust you to yeah hey whatever happens your family will get your share thank you so ill be hearing from you yeah yeah hows everyone doing is that baby ever gonna come out i know i know enough already its everything in its time walt i have your scan results yeah oh my god there are misconceptions it does not mean to classify someone we only need to determine that it hasnt grown jesus technically speaking a tumour can remain and the patient now in walts case id like to see i hope to see at least a to percent something to tell me that the cancer everybody still with me and how has my cancer responded walt your tumour has shrunk oh my god wait im really im confused is isnt  percent a lot mom yeah okay but imwait its very good news oh my god just when i try to get out thats great now that cough is the other thing according to your scan walt its okay this is fairly common see that scarylooking thing there thats tissue inflammation its usually not serious ill prescribe some prednisone tissue inflammation i are you sure about that i mean i because the other day what in your oesophagus that can be serious this is something were gonna have to wait a minute when did this happen im sorry i just with something like this now with these results but now at least the most important of which well have more to discuss but for now id say that you folks yes oh my god  what is the cost of lies its not that well the real danger is that then we no longer what can we do then what else is left but to and content ourselves in these stories it doesnt all we want to know in this story it was anatoly an arrogant unpleasant man he gave the orders at least not important ones and now dyatlov in a prison labour camp of course there were far greater and as for what dyatlov did do he deserves death but instead ten years what does that mean no one knows it doesnt matter what does matter is because you see to them a just world is a sane world there was nothing sane what happened there even the good we did all of it madness well ive given you theyll deny it of course i know youll try your best lyudmilla comrade dyatlov comrade dyatlov comrade dyatlov comrade dyatlov  what just happened theres a fire the turbine hall the controlsystem tank you and toptunov  no thats not  our first priority we know akimov we shut it down but theyre not all the way in ill disconnect the servos get the backup pumps running get water moving through the there is no core it exploded the core exploded hes in shock the lid is off  the stacks burning i saw it rbmk reactor cores dont worry something strange  do you taste metal comrade perevozchenko what a core cant explode were wasting time lets go get hydrogen out the generators  what about the fire  youre not on call tonight military and civil this is a big one but it doesnt look right pravik thinks theyre shining what if there are chemicals chemicals its covered in tar so its gonna burn all night thats it go back to bed  is it war here here are they bombing what the fuck is this   roentgen the good ones locked valera your face come on im going to find khodemchuk get shashenok hes in  go we need to get everyone out  shit we need to get into the reactor up two flights and across all right why are you going there  have you seen khodemchuk still in the pump room stay here ill come back viktor viktor viktor oh viktor im gonna get you can you stand khodemchuk get khodemchuk i dropped the control rods  theyre still up theyre still only a third of i sent trainees to the reactor  what about the pumps fuck the phones  are the pumps on or not i called for the electricians i dont give a shit i need water in my reactor core get down there and make now what does the dosimeter say  roentgen but thats  not great not terrible we did everything right get the pumps going  over here vasily hey vasily i dont know misha hook these up come on  you taste metal i dont know the valves misha the valves come on what do you need we need to get into the reactor but the doors jammed i dont think there are control no youre mistaken akimov said lets go ignatenko get on his hose its all right all right all right easy are you sure akimov ok move go go go lets go lets go hey hey lyudmilla do you come where were going to the railroad its not like anyone can i dont think you should go what do you mean dangerous  mikhail oh sorry  its vasily  did he say it was bad he said it was just the roof well hes never gotten hurt hell be fine get some rest the tank its big enough the control tank on    could do this definitely its gone i looked right into it did you lower take him to the infirmary toptunov take him  wheres kudryavtsev  i need a medic  his face the feed water is mildly do we still have  akimov call in the day shift but if we have to keep water we need electricians mechanics how many times im going to to call bryukhanov and fomin theyre gonna want i dont know if i can but i can certainly call in the day shift yes comrade dyatlov youre doing fine that one may be an hour hows it downstairs doctor  quiet nothing at this hour but babies you know i once went ten women went into labour  did i tell you that story well i wont need you if you want get some rest they havent brought  what fire oh it mustnt be too bad do we stock iodine  hm  you mean disinfectant does the hospital iodine pills hello hello who else knows this have you called fomin of course i want you to whatever the cause its i take it the safety test we have the situation under control it doesnt look shut up fomin i have to tell the central i have to get on the phone or god forbid frolyshev no one can blame you for this of course how can i be responsible tell me what happened quickly we ran the test exactly as chief unit shift chief akimov had technical difficulties of hydrogen it regrettably ignited damaging the plant the tank is quite large its of course deputy chief was directly supervising tests the hydrogen tank fire reactor were taking measures to ensure what about radiation down here its nothing im being told  not great but not horrifying  from the feedwater i assume well limit shifts to six hours the dosimetrists should have them use the good meter oh right ill call maryin have them wake up the therell be orders coming down here sure what do you think its the fuel for sure oh its the fuel for sure you clean floors my friend yuri works at the no gas no fire just atoms yuri says you cant if you do a glass of vodka  isnt yuri a plumber well it is beautiful yeah do you have a cigarette do you need help its over weve done all we can we need to start vasily you gotta put it out come on boys vasily its this path all the way up all the way in come on yeah going in now  what about the auxiliary the electricals gone the core i didnt go in there i think its time we we have to get water into the  we have to work on the valves what do you want boris if its true were dead is that what you need to hear we have to open the valves by hand the number of valves time to  then help us pump water into a ditch leonid im begging you watch the panel its not working just watch it i guess we know why is anyone saying what happened they were running through the controlsystem tank it doesnt make sense what about sabotage a bomb sitnikov bryukhanov said to use the good  we cant find the key follow me gentlemen welcome plenty of room i apologise for the lateness rest assured we are we built this shelter to by the americans erm as you can see a large control tank damaging reactor building four now i have spoken directly maryin spoke to frolyshev to central committee and dolghikh to now because the central committee for the work of the theyve asked me to brief so first the accident second because the efforts are considered key state that we ensure has no adverse consequences now to prevent a panic the a detachment of how large of a detachment between  and  men whats really going on here theres mild radiation but its  no it isnt you saw men outside vomiting you saw men with burns theres more radiation we have wives here i say we evacuate the town gentlemen please do you think i would keep her bryukhanov the air is glowing the cherenkov effect can happen i wonder how many of you know we all call it chernobyl what is its real name the vladimir i lenin exactly vladimir i lenin and how proud he would be especially you young man and the passion for is that not the sole purpose sometimes we forget sometimes we fall prey to fear but our faith will always be rewarded now the state tells us the have faith comrades the state tells us listen well its true when the people see but it is my experience that when the people that are not they should simply be told to keep their minds and leave matters of we seal off the city no one leaves and cut the phone lines contain that is how from undermining yes comrades we will all be rewarded for this is our moment to shine thank you comrade sitnikov well i sent my dosimetrists the large dosimeter the one with the thousand what was the number there was none the meter burned out  its typical sends us shit equipment  wonders why things go wrong from the military fire it only goes to  roentgen and it maxed out  roentgen  what game are you playing i asked and he took  hes my best man youre wasting our time i checked the meter whats wrong with you from feedwater leaking you dont then what the fuck i i walked around the exterior i think theres graphite you didnt see graphite  i did you didnt what what exploded yes sitnikov youre a nuclear now please tell me how not a meltdown an explosion  id love to know are you stupid no then why cant you i i dont see  but it did ill go up from there you can look right ill see it with my own my own eyes i apologise guards guards get him to a medic or its the feedwater you go then what go to the ventblock roof no no i wont do that of course you will youll be fine youll see come on ok lets begin leonid leonid oh all the way ok im sorry theres nothing to be sorry for i told you but we did  hello  yes whos the first deputy director of the kurchatov institute i am who am i this is boris shcherbina deputy chairman and head of the bureau theres been an accident at the  how bad is it there was a fire the systemcontrol tank controlsystem tank weve ordered them to  yes i see any contamination the plant manager bryukhanov thats significant you should youre an expert yes ive studied general secretary gorbachev has appointed a committee youre on it well convene that late forgive me dont you think given the legasov to answer direct questions about the function if they should nothing else  do you understand i didnt mean  you work too hard  where is everyone  why  why did you come in its boiling in here  milliroentgen a leak no it wouldve gone off before  its coming from outside iodine  its not military reactor fuel ignalina yes this is ulana khomyuk with looking for all right stay calm theyre at  its not them  whos the next closest thats not possible thats too far theyd have to be split open maybe they know something  iodine wed be seeing other isotopes nuclear test wed have heard thats what something like a satellite or noones answering the phone  get everyone started on an iv  all the children then as many as you can  wheres the old man what are you doing milk its milk  much better than water what are you doing these are radiation burns help me get it all off were taking it down he was a firefighter can you stop pushing please hey get him just get why are you keeping us out here professor legasov oh no not yet theyre itll be a few more minutes  no im fine thank you deputy chairman shcherbinas certainly thank you all right professor professor legasov thank you all for your duty we will begin with deputy and then we will discuss thank you im pleased to report that the situation military and civilian and colonel general pikalov who commands troops specialising has been dispatched in terms of radiation reports no more im told its the equivalent so if youre overdue  and foreign press kgb first deputy chairman we have successfully protected good very good well it seems like so if theres nothing else meeting adjourned no  pardon me this is professor legasov professor feel free to address them i cant im sorry page three era fireman on his hand by a chunk of smooth outside the reactor building smooth black mineral graphite theres graphite on the ground well there was a tank and what importance that theres only one place inside the core if theres it means it wasnt a control it was the reactor core  um comrade shcherbina i can assure you bryukhanov reports that  and as for the radiation which by the way is not the but rather  chest xrays that numbers been bothering me its also the maximum reading they gave us i think the true number if im right this fireman of four million chest xrays legasov theres no place its not alarmist well all i hear engaging in conjecture to what has been reported um er i apologise i didnt mean er please as calmly and as respectfully  professor legasov i will allow it an rbmk reactor every atom of u travelling at nearly penetrating everything woods metal concrete flesh every gram of u holds over a billion trillion thats in one gram now chernobyl holds and right now it is on fire winds will carry across the entire continent rain will bring them thats three million in the in the air we breathe the water we drink most of these bullets will not some of them yes and this concern stems entirely from yes hm comrade shcherbina i want you to go to chernobyl you take a look at the reactor and you report wise decision and take professor legasov oh forgive me comrade general do you know  no well then how will you know meeting adjourned how does a nuclear reactor work  what  its hardly a simple answer you presume so ill restate tell me or one of these soldiers will a nuclear reactor the steam turns a turbine where a typical power plant a nuclear plant in a nuclear plant we use you take an unstable element which has too many neutrons  a neutron is a yes the bullet so bullets are flying off now if we put enough the bullets from one atom will the force of this impact releasing a tremendous amount  and the graphite the neutrons actually travel its relatively unlikely that the uranium atoms in rbmk reactors we surround to moderate slow down good i know how now i dont need you can you help me not now  mikhail take her away from here please get away from them please take her please take please take her excuse me hes a fireman ignatenko ignatenko six paramilitary i need to find him please ignatenko hes being transported  hospital number six can i see him you wanna see him but theyre not tell them major burov allows it  when are they taking him were approaching what have they done  can you see inside look thats graphite on the roof the whole buildings the cores exposed i cant see how for gods sakes thats radiation well if we cant see it get us over the building  boris if we fly over an open reactor sir get us over that building if you fly over that core i promise you youll be begging perhaps if you came back just wonderful deputy secretary garanin ulana khomyuk  for nuclear energy  let me introduce such a lovely time i will thank you i must tell you this is why when we have a disease to cure in a lab noses in their books but when there isnt a problem  i know about chernobyl i know that the core is either whatever that means and if you dont immediately issue iodine tablets hundreds of thousands of people and god knows yes very good there has been but ive been assured  im telling you that there is im a nuclear physicist before you were deputy secretary yes i worked in a shoe factory and now im in charge to the workers of the world stable iodine from absorbing take one a day and go east get as far its overkill bryukhanov it doesnt matter how it looks shcherbina is stupid as he is pigheaded well tell him the truth in the bryukhanov comrade shcherbina colonel general bryukhanov and i deeply deeply honoured naturally we regret but as you can see we are in containing the damage we have begun our own enquiry and i have a list of individuals professor legasov  dangerous things apparently please tell me how im not prepared to explain it  as i presumed hes no answer really to spread disinformation why did i see graphite graphite is only found as a neutron flux moderator fomin why did see graphite on the roof oh that cant be comrade shcherbina thats not possible perhaps you saw burnt concrete now cos i may not know much but i know a lot about concrete  comrade i assure you you think legasov is wrong how should we prove it our highrange dosimeter we could cover one of our trucks mount the dosimeter have one of your men get give them every bit but even with lead shielding then ill do it myself good hes back its not  roentgen comrade shcherbina  what does that number mean it means the fire were watching the radiation released and thats every single hour  hours since the explosion  more tomorrow not in a week not in a month it will burn until the entire continent please escort comrades to the local party headquarters  thank you for your service youre excused dyatlov was in charge tell me how to put it out well use helicopters and no no you dont understand this is burning at over  degrees the heat will instantly how do we put it out you are dealing that has never occurred boron boron and sand well thatll create but i dont see any other way its going to take because you cant directly over the course how much sand and boron for gods sake roughly  tonnes and obviously were  an enormous area  focus on the fire but the wind is carrying all that radiation at least evacuate pripyat  thats my decision to make ive been told not to  is it or is it not this will go easier if you talk and not about the things where are you going im going to get you  theres a hotel id prefer one of those superstitious moscow are you here anything we should no were in position clear to proceed copy well go remind them about the perimeter they cannot fly directly  a minimum of a m perimeter lead  for preflight copy that  no no no theyre too close if they cant get over the fire the wind will have to carry it tell them lead  is too close copy lead  theyre not copying this lead  lead  do you copy lead  do you copy do you copy lead  lead  sir what do i tell the others is there any other way legasov send the next one in tell them to approach lead  approach from the west kurchatov institute marina gruzinskaya its oh yes  its been too long i was actually calling  the one in the country i wanted to see how hes doing yes its extremely hot but and they always bring oh which nephews simka whos  oh thats wonderful though children can make when theyre  maybe i should visit im sorry i have to get back to goodbye theyre dropping sand its what i would do yes im sure it is where are you going chernobyl its been smooth  drops what there are  people professor ilyan says the radiation  ilyan isnt a physicist if he says its safe its safe not if they stay here  were staying here and well be dead in five years im sorry i im sorry shcherbina thank you a nuclear plant in sweden and identified it the americans the reactor building the whole world knows the wind has been theyre not letting children in frankfurt do you want a smoke there has been a nuclear and the soviets the soviet version is this one of the atomic reactors at near the city of kiev and there is speculation that people were injured the soviets to acknowledge the accident in the form had already reached beyond the i said turn around im from the byelorussian  do you have permission i need to speak turn around right now if you arrest me to the highest we have to start sector by sector on foot are you all right of course comrades the guards arrested this woman id have put her in a cell but he thought you should know i know your reactor core i know the graphites on fire and youre dropping sand which you probably thought but youve made a mistake ulana yuriyvna khomyuk byelorussian institute and youre smothering the core but the temperature believe me im perfectly aware before it melts through  which gives us time you have yes the fuel would take a month but first the biological shield here and when it does  bubbler pools reservoirs i understand your concern but i confirmed it  the tanks are nearly empty each of these points here all drain to the bubbler pools im guessing that every pipe then there are that i saw on the way in the fire hoses theyve been gushing water into the tanks are full the tanks are full i have ten minutes then im back on the phone apologising to our enemies our power comes from do you understand do you understand boris professor legasov there is some good news the air drops are working theres been a reduction but the fire for at least another two weeks there is also nuclear fuel doesnt turn cold simply because in fact the temperature of the blanket of sand the uranium will melt the sand creating a kind of lava  through the shield below i anticipated this i believed there was time to reinforce before the lava and contaminated but as it turned out i was it was my understanding under the reactor this is ulana khomyuk thanks to her insight that the tanks are of water why is that a problem when the lava enters it will instantly superheat approximately causing a significant how significant we estimate between everything within a km radius including the three remaining the entirety of the radioactive will be ejected at force and dispersed which will extend and likely be fatal to the as well as a portion of minsk the release of radiation and will impact latvia lithuania byelorussia as well as poland czechoslovakia hungary romania and most of east germany what do you mean impact for much of the area of the food and water supply steep increase in the rates i dont know how many deaths for byelorussia and the ukraine impact means for a minimum of  years there are more living in byelorussia  yes and how long approximately  to  hours but we may have a solution we can pump the water unfortunately by a sluice gate manually from within so we need to find who know the facility to enter the basement here find their way through get to the sluice and give us the access we need of course we will need  my permission for what the level of radioactive theyll likely be dead were asking for your permission comrade legasov all victories and open the valve so well need three men wholl need to know and of course a yearly stipend of  roubles and er for those of you working in reactors  and  why are reactors  and  my friend was and er shes now dying and weve all heard and now you want us to swim do you even know i i dont have you dont need an exact number but you cant even tell us that why should we do this youll do it youll do it and if you dont if you tell me thats not this is what has always a thousand years of sacrifice and every generation i spit on the people and i curse the price im making my peace with it and go into that water because it must be done ananenko bezpalov baranov  is it possible that the water  yes if it doesnt work urgh get them in the truck get the hoses in uh im here to see my husband hes a firefighter from chernobyl well but major burov  he said please ive come all the way uh excuse me  uh excuse me excuse me  what are you doing here you cant be here i am here to see my husband hes a firefighter i know who ignatenko is i have permission i ive you can see him for  minutes and you cannot touch him  do you understand room  thank you  youre not pregnant are you i wont have to there they are wait wait no no he has it look who the cat dragged in what did i tell you theres no hiding from you just easy easy its ok ok yeah ok how how how did this happen  are you suggesting i did someone decided should be  kilometres caesium thats  kilometres  it was decided  i dont know maybe i ive just spent or maybe im just stupid is this really an uninformed that will cost made by some apparatchik im a career party man you should watch your tone comrades that the fire theres also been  and caesium emissions but the temperature is rising and uh theres a spike in zirconium thats from the cladding meaning what the meltdown has begun get off me get off me  stop moving get off him you cant be in here  whats happening to him  please yes put him through  well bubbler tanks are being drained we have successfully eliminated and the situation inside the core is deteriorating the concrete pad will last but after that legasov that the fuel and melt down wh and where does the pripyat river the primary water supply for not to mention crops were recommending we install to lower the core temperature and in order to do that all of the liquid nitrogen ah  oh all right whatever you need you have it  yes  no thank you id like to address wait who what exclusion zone minor details um premier ryzhkov if he determined look professor legasov you are there do you understand i dont want questions i want if you mean when will the halflife of plutonium so perhaps we should just say i think you and i its late im tired were taking a walk what is it you want not gonna sit back and what will happen to our boys which boys the divers the divers the firefighters what does the radiation well at the level ionising radiation tears the skin blisters this is followed by the immediate effects subside the patient healthy even but they arent this usually only lasts continue then the cellular damage the bone marrow dies the immune system fails the organs and soft tissue the arteries and veins to the point where you cant for the pain within three days that is what will happen and what about us well weve weve gotten a steady dose not strong enough but consistent enough so in time cancer or aplastic anaemia either way fatal well in a sense it would seem valery ive seen them before now you know why you can presume and our rooms theyve been here of course theyve been here but if were seeing them its because youve seen that the fuel is melting i know i have a plan  heat exchanger i hope theres something but i see youre already asking why did it explode ive worked the numbers presuming the worst possible and i always get which is  its not possible youre not gonna not on paper everyone who was dyatlov akimov toptunov  theyre all in moscow hospital number six we need to find out exactly moment by moment go now while theyre because if we dont find out it will happen again and khomyuk be careful well fuck you heres one heres one whats as big as a house burns puts out a shitload and cuts an apple a soviet machine made to cut  whos in charge here im shadov we know who you are how many men do you have on this shift  here i need all the  men and get on the trucks do you to where thats classified come on then you havent got enough bullets kill as many as you can whoevers left well beat the  you cant talk like that this is tula we dont leave youre going to chernobyl do you know we dig up coal not bodies the reactor fuel and poison the water from kiev forever they say they want you how are we supposed to do that they didnt tell me do you need to know now you look like vasily vasily ah no no no its not safe they touch you if its safe for them you where are the others they took them they wont tell me where can you open the curtains  hm mm please tell me tell me everything um i can see the red square and the kremlin spasskaya tower mausoleum do you see st basils  yeah yes its beautiful i told you i told you id show you moscow  huh thank you im not eating that give me something else im not a nurse im a nuclear physicist well then unless you happen to have a butter and caviar sandwich you can get the fuck what im not good at this boris the lying have you ever spent time no my advice tell the truth these men work in the dark andrei glukhov crew chief do these work to an extent of course so whats the job we need to install underneath this concrete pad theres no way to approach from the interior so you have to get at it and whats above the pad the core of the nuclear reactor which is melting down what like essentially is it gonna fall on top of us not if youre done dimensions break ground here dig a tunnel  metres to here excavate a space  by  metres because we need to keep disruption of the ground above you cant use  it has to be done by hand  at least well have how deep do you want this   for your protection at that depth from much of the entrance to the tunnel no and were not no were not we have some more will arrive by midnight  you can start in the morning i dont want my men here one more second if these worked  are they all like that  yes its uh  degrees fuck hey hey you  we need fans what do you mean to dig your fucking tunnel  whos talking to you its  degrees in there we cant breathe without masks its like a fucking oven fans will put dust in the air ive been breathing dust not this dust im sorry for your own good no fans my name is ulana khomyuk im a nuclear physicist i want you to tell me on the night of the accident is that all right yes i want to tell all right your official title was my name is i am the senior reactor at chernobyl senior engineer how old are you im  lyusya lyusya yes im here im here im have you been here noone said i should leave i did  minutes i said where have you been when the sores when he soils himself i looked after him in the north and west wing of patients from chernobyl  it isnt safe for you here not any more do you understand hes burned go home please i wont take much longer i dont want him to die though stay on the other side or ill have you  lyusya is it day no its nighttime now i think i had a dream and its just gone vasya were gonna have a baby the fire is out its out valery the miners are making they say the whole job  four weeks i know the job isnt over but its the beginning im sorry to bother you it is the miners what you wouldnt give us fans so were digging the old way were still wearing what do you want youre not as protected now are you telling me when this is over i dont know you dont know so the power level jumped yes very fast why didnt you initiate why didnt you press we did i reported the increase and he pressed the button leonid thats he did i swear i saw him do it and thats when it exploded what um which room is akimov  i pressed it before the explosion why i shut it down thank you comrade akimov i did everything right i did everything right get out get out let me go let me go  stop it stop it you let her in that room inside  did you know shes pregnant  what have you done where is her protection do you have any idea  of course i do please i  people will hear about this people are going to hear everyone is going to hear what is everyone gonna hear i am with the official ive been authorised  you can check my name is what is everyone gonna hear  you have your notes khomyuk was arrested what  why was it of course it was  im working on it im working on it what more do you want from me theyll see you now after thousands of sorties successfully extinguished the miners are working the fuel does not reach and furthermore theres no longer a threat the soviet people and risen to the task and they are to be commended lastly professor legasov and i to protect the security since the unfortunate following the accident we believe that there has been comrade charkov the highest standards  you have professor legasov will now speak thank you deputy chairman shcherbina and it is good the immediate danger is over now im afraid there is an enormous amount and contamination of approximately this entire region must be we must go to every town all animals still surviving whether domesticated or wild must be presumed contaminated and will have to be destroyed to prevent the spread in the immediate area uh every rock every tree the very ground itself has absorbed a dangerous amount which will be carried if left exposed so we will we will have to rip up and bury it under itself approximately um and finally we will need to construct around the power plant itself which will of course there will be deaths what amount of time we expect this liquidation and approximately  men including a number of doctors how many deaths thousands begin at once  comrade charkov yes professor my associate oh i mean no disrespect but i was wondering i dont know she was arrested by the kgb you are the first i am thats why arresting people any more but you are bothering i think the deputy chairman no no comrade i know youve heard when i hear them but we are not what people say yes people are following you people are following you see them they follow me the kgb is a circle nothing more you know the work  you really dont trust us but you know the old russian and the americans think that can you imagine it was very nice i need her so you will be accountable then its done  her name good day professor well that went you came off like a naive idiot naive idiots are not a threat ill come back  are you all right they let a pregnant woman doesnt matter they were stupid i was stupid dyatlov wont talk to me akimov yes valery akimov his face was gone you want to stop is that a choice i even have do you think the fuel  the concrete pad  chance maybe i said  either way the numbers maybe the core will melt maybe the miners ive told will save millions of lives maybe im killing them i dont wanna do this any more i want to stop but i cant i dont think you have a choice i think despite the stupidity youre compelled the problem has been assigned and you will stop at nothing because that is who you are a lunatic then a scientist did you know that they were  yeah akimov says and toptunov confirms it  they pressed the az no they say akimov pressed az and then the reactor exploded if it had been just one of them i wouldve put it down delusion even they were adamant comrade  do you think its possible i think its what i would say if i was trying to cover but i believe them then you should pursue it we have to pursue no matter how unlikely no matter what ill go back to the hospital and reinterview akimov if theyre still awake theyre not khomyuk  its time to go did you hear me this is  you have to come with me because they told me everyone in this village its not safe here whats wrong with you do you know how old i am i dont know old im  ive lived here my whole life right here what do i care about safe i have a job trouble youre not the first soldier when i was  the tsars men boys like you marching in lines they told us to leave no then there was stalin the holodomor my parents died they told the rest of us no then the great war german boys russian boys more soldiers more famine my brothers never came home but i stayed and im still here so i should leave now because of something no just one moment its time to go please stand up now this is your last warning its time to go    legasov ill meet him there the atom is a humbling thing its not humbling why is the core still exposed why have we not we want to the debris on the roof is until we can push it off itll kill anyone you can see weve named them  roentgen per hour presume two hours the one on the side nina we used remotecontrolled too heavy  so then lunokhod strs theyre light they can withstand we couldnt put a man at least we can keep a man that is the most important under no circumstances robots only what about masha  roentgen if you were to stand there head to toe for two minutes your life expectancy by three minutes even our lunar rovers an amount of gamma radiation the particles literally shred the circuits if its more complicated masha will destroy it it would be fair to say that is the most so what do we do thats what tent  hey its all right its free its a little early  bacho  yeah what unit were you in er they had me in motor pool not this bullshit oh i erm im not in the military theyre running out of men showers food those guys those guys they cut down trees those guys they evacuate  what about them janek  what do you want  no ive only got the one hes with me you understand we make these from lead scrap  put it on under your balls no no you can wait until yes now over your clothes fucking shit  you ever go hunting well todays your lucky day you me that ugly armenian we do animal control animal control yeah theyre radioactive but its not hard theyre happy to see you they run right up to you bang we load the bodies on the truck bury them in concrete as much vodka as you want lets go get you a gun yes i need to see theyre listed im working for comrade she can have that one thank you comrade  all clear  signal running onboard diagnostics tell me when to think not that one i know not that one this rover was in storage that should cover and masha the central committee that they may have that could work up there  american its a german police robot but west german that wasnt diagnostics complete ready to begin can we move it valery was that a smile i see your condition has no leave i need your help akimov initiated az  when you gave the order toptunov called it out it was the only good decision can you confirm after they attempted how do i even know it exploded i found this written in  its about the operation under extreme conditions so the names of the authors and two pages have been removed well the state must protect do you dare suggest otherwise they made a mistake they didnt redact the missing pages a positive void coefficient does that mean anything to you what are you after you worked with this reactor so everythings my fault then  is that what this is im here to find out and whether im your best chance can you help me or not i have no idea void coefficients there now you can go  youre not even curious what you think the right there is no truth ask the bosses whatever and i will get the bullet i only have two rules one dont point this gun at me you can point it at this piece never me two if you hit an animal keep shooting until it does dont let them suffer or ill kill you understand i mean it ive killed a lot of people good then were ready once we start theyll run so we go door to door ok good hey do your job door to door go go go away go  dont let them suffer sorry youre dragging that you gonna eat drink again look this happens to everyone normally when you kill a man but for you a dog so what theres no shame in it you remember your first time my first time afghanistan we were moving through a house and i shot him in the stomach yeah thats a real war story theyre never any good stories theyre shit a man was there  boom stomach i was so scared for the rest of the day i thought you put a bullet in someone youre not you any more but then you wake up the next and you realise you just didnt know the happiness of all mankind what our goal is the happiness yeah im happy im happy every day all right back to work come on its here push it over easy now careful pull it joker what the germans named them  is it ready good signal cameras motors motors good signals good all right lets take this easy forward one metre forward one germans reverse one did you lose the signal its not the signal its dead of course i want them to hear do you know what tell those idiots i dont give a fuck tell them dont tell tell fucking gorbachev the official position is that a global is not possible they told the germans that the highest detected was  roentgen they gave them that robot we need a new phone what if we dont clear it we have to clear it if we dont clear the roof if we cant cover it nearly twice the radiation  every hour hour after hour what about lead we could i dont know and pour it from above first weve already used most theres lead sheeting in the other reactor buildings the soldiers are stripping it are you serious even if boiling metal in a helicopter and its lead boris what if we shoot the graphite weve got highcalibre bullets they wouldnt just ricochet you wanna shoot at an exposed nuclear reactor  well lets go light that roof it was so easy what are we talking about here we need another robot one that can withstand ive asked there is nothing the americans if the americans do you really think and the central committee you know it i know it there are no robots biorobots whats that we use biorobots men a lot today where do they get their food they eat the chickens then they eat each other door to door pavel pavel did you not hear me fuck just go outside go comrade soldiers the soviet people have they want us to clean it up and we have entrusted you because of the nature you will each have to solve this problem listen carefully and do exactly this is for your own safety you will enter reactor but do not immediately when you get to the top behind the entrance to the roof you will need it this is the working area some of it is in blocks weighing they all must be watch your comrades then turning to the left take care not to stumble take care not to fall you will need to move quickly and you will need do you understand your mission yes comrade general these are the most important commit your task to memory its time to go after when you hear it drop your shovels in the bin above all while on the roof do not look over the rail very well comrade soldier youre done time to go oh your glove mummy mummy sorry for all this we needed to speak to you theyre going to put and bryukhanov and fomin were going to be asked to all three of us but before that happens the central committees its the headquarters atomic energy agency what are they asking you to do tell the world what happened well then ive constructed a timeline minute by minute every decision every turn of a switch  and are they guilty of gross incompetence violation of safety regulations but the explosion what do you mean ive analysed the data toptunov was telling the truth they shut the reactor down i think this article but two pages have been removed youve seen this before please believe me that i had no idea  none of us knew in  a fuel channel ruptured the operators pressed az but instead of the power for a brief moment it went up how is that possible this is the question posed hes the one when an rbmk reactor its notoriously unstable under normal circumstances the control rods under normal circumstances the chernobyl staff stalled they pulled almost to bring the power back up this is what volkhov learned if the boron control rods are completely withdrawn when theyre put back in the first thing that enters its graphite the control rods that displace water and steam so the reactivity doesnt go why on earth they didnt know volkhov warned the kremlin ten years ago but there could be no doubt about the supremacy oh the kgb classified it when i saw the reactor i still didnt think because the flaw unless the operators to the edge of disaster  so it is their fault but not only their fault no is that what youre you cant possibly be there are  rbmk reactors running in the soviet union we have to fix them the only way to do that force the central committee what youre proposing is that that is obsessed we can make a deal with the kgb youll leave this information and they quietly let us fix a deal with the kgb theyll go after your family you have a chance if that chance was mine but it isnt is it ive known braver souls men who had their moment because when its your life and the lives your moral conviction it leaves you and all you want at that moment do you know the name no he was a fireman he died two weeks ive been looking in she gave birth a girl the baby lived for four hours the radiation but the baby absorbed it her baby we live in a country to save their mothers to hell with your deal and to hell with our lives someone has to start congratulations comrades you have performed i wish you good health all of you are awarded  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  i serve the soviet union  thank you  i hear they might this little problem if its yes i think promotions who knows maybe moscow naturally theyll put me and then ill need someone i could pitch sitnikov i would like to be considered well keep that in mind viktor petrovich preparations for the test comrade dyatlovs been working and reactor outputs with your approval were ready itll have to wait is er are you going to ask me you cant read a fucking face three years three years ive just had a call from he says we cant lower power a grid controller its not the grid controllers its the end of the month all the productivity quotas everyones working overtime someones pushing down not that well ever know who so do we have to scrap it no i dont think so no if we need to wait running at half power were not  no i should think its safe well maintain at  ill go home get some sleep well proceed then ill personally supervise and it will be completed well im not waiting around call me when its done how do you feel you went to the doctor you dont know from vienna it says at last a soviet obviously i resent the you made an excellent impression turns out at what lying statecraft legasov statecraft the west is now satisfied that chernobyl was solely which it essentially was we have you to thank for that and we intend to hero of the soviet union our highest honour they havent even promotion to director im humbled i dont think theres anything valery alexeyevich and these rewards first your testimony comrade charkov i understand but you gave us assurances its been months no changes even discussed first the trial once its over we will have our hero after that did you take a train yes i took a train now lets talk about vienna im not here to scold you i know how the world works despite what shcherbina says so why are you here because im brutally stubborn which you were hoping for charkov is saying they will fix do you believe him the state will never because acknowledging means admitting that they lied they will have to be forced at the trial youre going youre going to convince a jury its a show trial the jurys already been im not talking about them the central committee have invited members of to observe the trial our colleagues from kurchatov from sredmash from minenergo they will be sitting listening to every word a jury that and when your testimony arrives at the moment of that is when our jury and do what with it insist on reform not just to the rbmk no no no no no they cant function without us do you know the man whose report you found they just removed him from sacked and you think handpicked will somehow be stirred because of some heroic stance  yes because youre valery legasov id like to think that if i but i know how the world works they will shoot me khomyuk you told me to find out i spoke to dozens of people every word they said all in these books these are the ones these are the ones who are dead they died rescuing each other tending to the wounded they didnt hesitate they simply did so have i so have i i went willingly so ive already given my life isnt that enough no im sorry but it is not the central committee of the communist party and presidium of the is determined that justice on behalf of the people in accordance with as determined by its th which is a leninist goal it was is and will be the only immutable goal the path of leninist principles shall be consistently as it expresses the vital its hopes and aspirations as we guide the life this session of court comrade judge indictments  viktor bryukhanov nikolai fomin are accused of violating of the criminal code resulting in a nuclear disaster the state calls witnesses of the belarussian comrade legasov of the kurchatov and comrade boris deputy chairman of and head of the bureau it began with of all things why was there need reactor no was not new in fact it went into operation and  days later plant director viktor bryukhanov certifying the completion of as a result before the end of the year comrade bryukhanov was awarded comrade fomin was awarded comrade dyatlov was given but the work was not finished this document was a lie in order to sign all safety tests had to have and yet one remained a nuclear reactor generates heat a series of pumps send a constant flow of the cores heat and the steam and the result is electricity but what if a power plant what if the power feeding a blackout equipment failure if theres no power the pumps cannot move water and without water the core in short a nuclear disaster the solution three diesel fuel so problem solved no bryukhanov knew the problem the backup generators took to reach the speed required to power the pumps and by that time so we arrive at the safety test the theory was this if the facility lost power the would take some time what if you could take the electricity and transfer it to the pumps what if the dying turbine could keep the pumps working to bridge the second gap any questions no continue please to test this theory the reactor is placed in  megawatts to simulate then the turbines and as they slowly spin down their electrical output to see if its enough the science is strong but a test is only as good the first time they tried the second time they tried the third time they tried the fourth time they tried was april th  comrade khomyuk to understand we have to go back april th the day the test by two in the afternoon the from its normal output level to  megawatts and is stable to its final output level but before they can proceed power grid officials in kiev a further reduction in they are asking this is the first the first link competent management would have these three men why was this delay so dangerous it created two problems one of them and the other is very human this is the one at midnight there is a shift change  khodemchuk toptunov want to buy toptunov hes got more hair on his face hair is that whats on his lip leonid fedorovych akimov says come to the  hes already here something about a test you see desperate sasha you know the test they were turbine rundown they couldnt do it so theyve given it to us to us  we dont know what  we dont know what it is we take it down to  the rest is stolyarchuk but dyatlov i have to do something with dyatlov yeah well dont worry im just looking are we supposed to do those yes this is akimov in  i have the manual you did it last year on yes in the programme theres well theres a lot of things well what should i what youre sure right thank you he says to follow then why are they crossed out weve been cleared  good now is it too much to ask that  well stolyarchuk  yes i havent reviewed there review it or you can just do i think even you as stupid well lets go switch the turbine off while  thats not good toptunov reduce power to  ive never done this with its ok im with you reducing power to  i want you to think i want you to imagine of his mission into space until the moment i want you to imagine that all that he has never seen before some of which this is exactly in the control room the nightshift had not been they hadnt even been warned leonid toptunov the operator responsible the reactor that night was all of  years old and his total experience this is the human problem but inside the reactor core in the space between something far more dangerous the time is past midnight comrade legasov im pleased to see from the kurchatov institute but you dont need to be to understand what happened you only need to know this there are essentially inside a nuclear reactor the reactivity either goes up or it goes down thats it all the operators do uranium fuel as uranium atoms split apart if you dont balance it never stops rising so boron control rods they reduce reactivity but theres a third factor cool water takes heat as it does it turns to steam in an rbmk reactor of the type theres something called what does that mean it means that the more steam the higher the reactivity which means more heat which means more steam it would appear we have and we would and we would the negative temperature when nuclear fuel gets hotter so fuel increases reactivity control rods and water steam increases it the rise in temperature this is the invisible dance without smoke or flame and it is beautiful when things are normal as uranium splits apart it breaks down into xenon reduces reactivity this is the poison when the core is running it burns the xenon away but because of the delay has been held at half power the xenon did not burn away it built up poisoning the core were starting to lose balance at  minutes past midnight the reactor is now and yet in less than an hour if you cant understand could lead to an explosion after all you dont work in the control room but as it turned out the men who did easy now take it down  like that were following protocol youre procrastinating ten other men in this plant keep working kirschenbaum come get me yes comrade dyatlov ok very slow now lets ease it down to  whoa whoa whoa slow ii didnt move any rods there  what is this we did everything right if so then because youre choking i think if we turn off lac it may be possible do it go switch off local automatic leonid lac disabled what did you do ii did what you said  look at it fucking amateurs  how did you get this job youre gonna tell me you you incompetent arsehole i apologise for what are you doing we have to shut  no we have to shut down tests tonight we cant raise the power  dont talk about rules no no the rules dont say  comrade dyatlov i apologise but what youre  raise the power i wont do it it isnt safe safety first always ive been saying that thats how long ive done is that longer than you akimov  yes yes and you with your mothers tit if i say its safe its safe if the two of you disagree you dont have to work here but not just here or ignalina or leningrad you wont work anywhere i think you know raise the power i would like you to record raise the power together then i wasnt even there what i wasnt in the room if you werent there comrade legasov you are i will ask the questions here if you werent in the room the toilet the toilet khomyuk interviewed everyone they all told the same story i knew what dyatlov ordered but if i didnt do what he said leonid toptunov no comrade dyatlov you ordered them to raise the court is now in recess do you know anything not really no it was mostly jews and poles the jews were killed in pogroms and then the nazis came but after the war people came to they knew the ground under but they didnt care dead jews dead poles but not them noone ever thinks and here we are how much time maybe a year they call it a they call it a long illness it i know you told me but time passed and i thought i wasted it i wasted it all for nothing for nothing do you remember that morning how unconcerned i was i dont believe much but when they told me they were putting me and they said it wasnt serious you know why because they put you in charge yeah im an inconsequential man thats all ive ever been i hoped that one day i just stood next to people there are other scientists any one of them but you everything we asked for men material lunar rovers who else could have done they heard me of all the ministers the entire congregation they mistakenly sent for gods sake boris you were the one ah its beautiful comrade legasov the time is past midnight the reactor is nearly shut down the operators of reactor  that leads directly to disaster theres no way to turn back they do not yet know it at  megawatts but none of it is burning away the reactor is to make matters worse the reactor isnt hot enough the only way to safely is to do it very very slowly over the course of  hours but dyatlov wants it done now akimov and toptunov have they begin pulling control rods halfway out threequarters still the power does not budge so they begin pulling them there were  control rods akimov and toptunov remember control rods of  rods only six now remain as for the fuel its gone cold so the negative temperature is no longer weighing down but even still the xenon the best they can do is raise the control rods are out the emergency system the only thing keeping is water and xenon its one in the morning im sorry this is all we can weve pulled if thats all we have but the test requires  stolyarchuk lets get ready  wait a second we havent enough steam for the test to deliver valid  its enough i said its enough i know main pump four connected we should warn khodemchuk never mind him kirschenbaum the steam in the separator drum all right lets all help him  we should stop you have  minutes  minutes they may as well the problem they were facing the power was too low the test was already ruined the but dyatlov didnt care all he wanted to do  am yuvchenko a mechanical perevozchenko is in the refuelling hall high above the tonne degtaryenko khodemchuk are in the pump room none of them have been told none of them know at  and  seconds toptunov sees a report from the based on the absence the computer is recommending of course its saying that it doesnt know all right comrades another few minutes kirschenbaum we did everything right oscillograph on closing no throttle valve generator rotor  and four seconds with every decision they have pulled this reactor further than anyone now the test begins the pumps are shut down the pumps stop moving water the uranium fuel is now unchecked by control rods the balance immediately swings in less than a second inside the core is quickly converting to steam a void is being created there is no fresh water steam increases reactivity increases heat increases steam increases reactivity the remaining xenon decays away the power is rising theres nothing left to stop it  and  seconds we we have a power surge what did you do  and  seconds in every control room of every there is a button the scram will instantly in soviet reactors you press az all of the and the reaction is but what are you waiting for tell your lies comrade dyatlov you will  or what  comrade dyatlov enough comrade dyatlov there was no way to avoid what  comrade dyatlov i know what you are valery weve heard enough for today the defendants  court will i still have its not necessary  your honour  well resume tomorrow with comrade shcherbina let him finish dyatlov broke every rule he pushed a reactor he did these things az a simple button but in the circumstances the shutdown system at  akimov engages az the fullywithdrawn control rods begin moving back these rods are made of boron but not the tips the tips are made of graphite why why for the same reason containment buildings like those in the west for the same reason we dont use properlyenriched fuel for the same reason that builds watercooled with a positive void its cheaper the first part of the are the graphite tips and when they do the reaction in the core which every last molecule instantly converts to steam which expands and ruptures the control rods in those the graphite tips endlessly accelerating chernobyl reactor   on the enormous steel lid and sees the impossible the control rod which each weigh kg he runs to warn but theres nothing he can do  and  seconds the steam blows we do not know we only know the final reading reactor  designed to operate went beyond  the pressure inside the core at long last we have arrived explosion in the instant the lid oxygen rushes in it combines with hydrogen the chain of disaster comrade dyatlov comrade dyatlov noone in the room that night could act as a detonator they didnt know it because it was kept from them comrade legasov your own testimony in vienna my testimony in vienna i lied to the world im not the only one who kept we were following orders from the kgb and right now there are with the same fatal flaw three of them are still running less than km away professor legasov the soviet state is somehow then i must warn you you are ive already trod were on dangerous ground because of our secrets they are practically when the truth offends we until we can no longer remember but it is still there every lie we tell sooner or later that is how an rbmk reactor core explodes lies valery alexeyevich legasov son of alexei legasov head of ideological compliance do you know yes as a student you had in komsomol communist youth correct  you already know yes at the kurchatov institute you were in that position of jewish scientists yes to curry favour youre one of us legasov i can do anything but what i want the most youre not brave youre not heroic youre just a dying man i know who i am and i know what ive done in a just world id be shot not for the truth scientists and your idiot obsession when the bullet hits your skull noones getting shot legasov the whole world it would be embarrassing and for what your testimony today will not it will not be disseminated it never happened no you will live but not as a scientist not any more youll keep your title but no duties no authority noone will talk to you noone will listen to you other men lesser men will receive credit your legacy is now their legacy you will live long enough what role none he didnt know what role did khomyuk none after all youve said it would be curious i would think a man would know a lie you will not meet or communicate with either one of them you will not communicate about chernobyl ever again you will remain so immaterial that when you finally do die it will be exceedingly hard to and if i refuse why worry about something why worry about something oh thats perfect they should put that to be a scientist we are so focused we fail to consider how few but it is always there whether we choose to or not the truth doesnt care about it doesnt care about our ideologies our religions it will lie in wait and this at last where i once would fear the cost what is the cost of lies  the ear has fluid if he develops a fever call me and ill write yes thank you dr delgado  tell the doctor thank you hows max he must be turning nine yes this month see you tomorrow luc√£a see you later doctor  dr delgado  hurry this is a mistake  im not a wealthy man you dont want to do this i know people powerful men you dont want to mess with them yeah i bet you do doc all clear turns out those are just the you remember this guy no well we sure as fuck do dont move jesus check this out fucking pharmacy in here i got dibs on anything fun this is not right  take that shit off the men who killed your agent theyre all in prison not all of them it wasnt what you think i was brought to the house they didnt tell me why i had nothing to do with it i only gave him medical care and pleaded with them to let him go with everything i had i pleaded need him conscious fucker keeps passing out doc adrenaline will keep him up got this from our buddies at the cia see i told you so hey asshole not gonna talk wait hold on got any cigarettes im out go on doc that the point where you weve been on you for weeks doc we know what you are so im not gonna ask you this twice unless you want me to blow all over that wall over there give me a name the other person on the tape tell me his name no please no miguel √£ngel what time is it very early darling couldnt sleep again yeah not even a little happy birthday my love ive never fucked excuse me zunos here sir good  have him wait on the patio clavel i think she needs to be changed yes maam excited for the party tonight sure cynthia ill take my  yes sir open it oh wow you dont have that one right no i dont think so its very nice put it with the others thank you whats the word on your uncle sends his regrets turns out he wont be oh really cabinet meetings i want three fucking governors tonight the government is my partner it hey everybody loves a party thats good the envelope for this ill look into it usually it comes first of the month  people are asking like always but i dont want to the governments shitting people know theyre being lied to theyll get over it where else can they go its the government life goes on the past is the past yeah except when it isnt the aztecs thought a lot fuck who doesnt they believed the world had once in darkness once with a hurricane once in fire and once in a flood and they were pretty sure they knew how it was going to end the next time on september th  an earthquake measuring entire neighborhoods collapsed the government claimed community activists put the it looked like a fucking people dug through searching for loved ones when the army showed up great here comes the cavalry but instead of searching for their only order a week after the quake thousands of protesters hit the some fucking answers and when all the government they started wondering if it from decades of oneparty pri rule maybe the quake wasnt the but the pris shitty created an opposition movement and one day that would come just cause things have stopped shaking doesnt mean there isnt underneath the surface dont forget these fuck you enjoy your trip up north call me when its done what happens if we get pulled over dont get pulled over miss isabella how are you the boss is expecting you lead the way careful not to slip wait here business looks good everything looks good i just wish we were meeting this is where our business is done please ram√£¬≥n mon lets go  all our stuffs broken down how long am i gonna have to look havent heard anything since they dropped maybe h√£ctor palma i mean if i left  kilos id show a little more courtesy you counted it you didnt take that shit somewhere else maybe using our plaza were supposed to move put it somewhere else n√£stor just get it out of the fucking way yes boss you ready for tonight yeah know what youre going to say yes enedina i know its important benjam√£n our family is losing money every day were getting fucked and well i just hope were sending ram√£¬≥n dont wake up mom when you get home  and dont let him drink too much  no hey dina you look so handsome  have fun tonight hey man what its for the drive tonight is business im always cool you be cool lighten up a little lets go then hit the horn again g√£¬ºero hey man when we get there we need to check  the guy called me its already there everythings cool we got it a room a fucking hotel cochi sure why not your blessing ma may god bless and take care  have fun  hello mrs guzm√£n what the fucks that trying to get your dick sucked or what fuck off let me pack this in you know we were bringing wives fucking g√£¬ºero true love cochi hey g√£¬ºero fucking chapo hey guadalupe its amado what happened what do you mean nothing ive been waiting like wheres acosta fuck he isnt coming hes the boss asshole hey lets go now next i just need my one moment sir next please come forward through this door by definition drug trafficking so rolling them up you start by taking whatever off the street then use leverage double digit prison and get him to flip on the that was essentially the put guys in custody get them except this being mexico we couldnt actually arrest anyone and if you want to be a lawyer about it the whole fucking thing come afternoon walt mike can you step out so the doctors taking a trip  there wasnt any trouble no sir clean clockwork hes gonna be a big hit this name delgado gave you camarenas torturer exdfs whoever hired him can that connects f√£lix guys an active duty grabbing hims not gonna be as easy as throwing a hood no one knows were here sooner or later the when do you want to move next  hours  max jesus christ listen my guys have worked up a solid but we have to go now mexico city says the when what were doing here comes legal diplomatic its a good thing were not diplomats i dont want you taking its my understanding that you have experience with this kind of thing its a unique situation but im confident that and the mexicans on your team my guys are solid all of them and they know why theyre here you fuck with the dea nowhere is safe move on verd√£n  quietly walt do not get fucking caught yes sir what happened i got the green light and you told him about our bodyguards fuckedup i mean i kept it simple the man thinks we got a plan so i put you down for two million that money were collecting to push those sandinista everyones chipping in its good for business lets hope so ive got planes in the were pushing more volume my problem isnt volume its cash flow that bullshit at the border hes coming tonight right they told me hell be here are you sure try to relax you want an outsiders opinion what youre asking right now its a lot given how things have been going my people are asking questions im out of time i have

the right i thought you said you had nothing look this person has highlevel and youre the agent in what the fuck arent you seeing yep yep fucking hell making a habit of these visits though i must say im not what happened with the nomination gave my life to this party and they so the bigeared dwarf and his look cuauht√£moc c√£rdenas he was a governor in michoac√£n a member of the pri he was your colleague yeah and i know his father too theyre a fucking institution old man would win the presidency and privatization undoes the farmland the oil all of it did your homework congratulations the party plans to destroy he needs us make the introduction i have to admit the italian do you know why cuauht√£moc because of us says the party is in league with hes got to need something c√£rdenas takes office and youre in a jail cell the same day you think c√£rdenas can actually win i dont think i know so they called it the national system of political better known in mexico as snipe it was a system engineered based on voter registration data basically a way to figure where and how sound familiar well in  in mexico it wasnt it was fucking unheard of before  there had never i guess thats the deal a oneparty system tends but all it takes is once an earthquake and a recession and then an idealist the big surprise of the campaign has been the leftist candidate c√£rdenas is a former member of the pri he left it last year accusing when hope catches on that shit spreads like a prairie fire c√£rdenas has support educated centers the pris influence is less populated areas where ignorance and yeah but these are just a preview of whats to come okay but none of this is exact these projections arent gonna change because a margin of error is built in which brings us to the real problem mexico city c√£rdenas is projecting a coin toss no a fucking tragedy what about the rest of le√£¬≥n guanajuato doing well there yes but it wont matter the first precincts to theyre the only ones every six years they report a landslide pri victory if a pri candidate after the first precincts report or worse they cant its gonna be fucked c√£rdenas has given people they see these numbers on election day theyll know change is coming and nothing will pull his the pri is gonna be crushed its time we meet again cant imagine why drop the act its time for you to open your eyes im wide awake my friend quite content with the view i dont know what youre seeing c√£rdenas has your brother beat ah so youve heard an exciting time even the less fortunate my brother will be their president too you dont understand my family has experience stories like c√£rdenass they come you hear the one about the pope he went boating with c√£rdenas they say the popes hat blew off and c√£rdenas walked across but you and me know the truth the pris gonna hold his was there anything else all right lets see lets see what you think of this zapopan c√£rdenas is up by  percent puebla  percent zipolite ask

the drop everything for some girl do you like her mimi i want f√£lix thats all im interested in are you gonna help me or not why whats he to you he killed a federal agent you knew him that agent who died camarena no i didnt you know why i like fixing roofs i grew up in a small house lots of brothers and sisters teaches you quick easier to fix things yourself so when the girl starts telling shit must be bad yeah and youre out i guess thats life right sooner or later everything turns that why youre here everything go to shit i told you why im here right that dead agent truth of it is look around this place it all feels different colombians cocaine fucking politicians not sure where i fit in anymore thats why im here because the truth matters to me you expect me to trust you three years ago i was back home working a shift i got a call about a oneeighteen it was a gangrelated shooting but it wasnt in my area it was in the town over from me so i knew something was wrong my brother had died he took three to the chest and bled out with an eightball of cocaine on and no matter what anybody tells you im the reason why i believe the worlds a bad place and i dont think im much better but we have to try so thats why im here im trying to do something what would it look like me and you helping each other out well you cross that border tell me everything you know his whole operation in return i can provide you with protection what about mimi  she involved not at all i dont want her near this i dont see any reason to involve her you have my word got a card motel carrasco i know the number there my brother was a junkie he died with a needle in his arm all of this data has been confirmed on july th youre all going down what will that leave you well i think we can these projections but guarantee nothing how is andr√£s anyway still bitter about the what you didnt expect me to believe your associates put these together no it leads me to one conclusion only the party knows these exist and they have some experience in no c√£rdenas knows too i made sure of that when these projections get out its going to create a ground and nothing the party i see so i take it you have a cure for this disease sure to kill us im listening tell the people a different story those projections came from capable of reporting election and the early results will show the whole country c√£rdenas is winning but there could be another program one capable of reporting the opposite and in time when an official and c√£rdenas has won what good will your bullshit will he have won you tell the masses c√£rdenas is losing they wont leave the fucking house youll have taken their hope away people only want to back a winner whos going to vote for a loser  well sure but it makes up the and people have to wait six years because youll have won the without tampering with a single ballot and in return i get a direct relationship my interests are protected always i must say im impressed id heard stories about you quite a rise for a piece you should know something these men i speak for f√£lix they make wonderful friends i find out youre lying what the fall is swift you dont survive it youll hear from me you can take that stupid so how do you think it went you offer him a deal i did you think hell take it i think he should tell me something hows a girl like you end up just lucky i guess bullshit out here in the middle of nowhere where i dont belong i was born where i belong and it never meant shit and acosta i love him thats a good enough reason aint it to want to see someone change honestly after today i wouldnt know im not quite sure what yeah gets tough dont it making heads and tails of this life i guess so i hope it works out for you how about that sidearm im pregnant thats why its

intelligence gilberto rodr√£guez was his arrest may lead against civilians and police no doubt the cartel leaders are now in hiding and their security apparatus so the only thing we can be certain of is that any further operation will be both very difficult we appreciate the volatility well in that case whos responsible for this situation maybe he can walk us through so agent pe√£a what comes next the floor is yours don gilberto leave it there okay enjoy your meal hello hi brother its me how are you doing better if i knew how this happened gilberto someone betrayed us where the fuck were those pigs we pay it was an american operation our friends knew nothing about it unless our friends maybe they need a reminder relax miguel my situation will be rectified soon the truth is that things and our friends in the north valley you need to set a meeting with henao compliment him  on what he likes tequila have a bottle ready tell him this is just a small setback in the meantime increase your personal security the americans will come after you next your freedom is our best leverage gilberto this is getting dangerous what if theres a leak there may be find out i need to go brother i love you i love you too brother  what do you got for me well we knew it wasnt gonna be easy all due respect were being told that and now were being told there isnt were fucking grounded look ill see what i can do im meeting with the new and feistl you asked for this dont forget that cause i know i wont colombia had recently elected a man named ernesto samper escobars hitters had tried so he was no friend of the narcos and while he knew his country he and his new staff including were already in a tough spot politically the surrender deal was ugly but they were willing to live with it gilbertos arrest made that and they werent shy about saying it i wanted to offer my congratulations on the arrest of gilberto rodr√£guez thank you sir colonel mart√£nez deserves the credit unfortunately he should be i imagine he knew there might be a surrender deal was on the table which wouldve brought all four leaders and now thats been complicated and we are faced with the unknown understood though im not sure murderers negotiating the deal preceded my tenure but between the two of us but no one wants a return and the bloodshed of los pepes no of course not i wont ask if the rumors about your involvement but i do have a question if it turns out that we are indeed can i trust you you can trust that my only agenda let me know if i can do anything sir my team in cali severe restrictions they need their independence ill make a call thank you sir pe√£a justice can be hard to find and a man as powerful wont stay in custody for long if you want to keep him behind bars yes sir im on it im

knew about the raid look gentlemen i want to know why my brother and if any one of us is involved in this of course consider it done sir miguels paranoid maybe they used one of their spy planes youre not taking this seriously miguel doesnt think they got lucky and the system would tell us this is about the surrender right youre worried your retirement plans listen to me people love drama brother you know that this isnt drama he wants names and theres no reason to think we designed the system mr c√£¬≥rdova so anything good just a bunch of shittalking and what about internally no not really

there are no mistakes hey here he comes there he is i would have gladly met you thats what youre worried about how about earning the money we pay you  you couldnt give a fuck about that logistics planning the dummy raid by the time we knew what they were mart√£nez had already been you useless piece of shit you know what else is odd it looks like the dea never left cali and you were the one who confirmed you only you confirmed those two fucking do you know where you are you want to hang me out to dry i asked the americans how they found they followed someone there i know it wasnt me fucking calder√£¬≥n what he said made sense the dea followed someone it must be pallomari the dea knows they must have come back didnt you say you drove pallomari it could just as easily have been me yeah but it wasnt was it you think miguel will let this slide not a fucking chance jorge if this thing comes back on me and then were both fucked the only thing we need is a name we have to get on the same page here calder√£¬≥n told us those fuckers from he burned us he is the one responsible hes a dirty cop who takes money from a drug cartel but you and me we are brothers let me cut to the chase i didnt realize you were taking such no other choice when friends of course well then tell your father there is still a path no one here is happy the dea blindsided all of us and its old deal nicol√£s politics is about appearances for us its extremely difficult whos already in prison that just looks bad but different terms new terms what do you say so what did you find out the dea team calder√£¬≥n was escorting he reported that they had what do you think jorge it was a mistake born of incompetence the dea got lucky and calder√£¬≥n took the bait well were not paying for incompetence besides that doesnt explain how did they get that information its unlikely its possible the dea used from here on out keep an eye on calder√£¬≥n limit what we tell him no more lapses in security yes sir lets go thank you jorge its either him or us what if they kill him they wouldnt kill a cop but they can question him by the time they get to it hello good afternoon someone is here thanks for seeing me didnt

a son of a bitch  and hes been fucking the sister the sister i dont even know her name but no plan is perfect especially when you deal at some point and your enemies are watching and waiting theyre gonna see your weakness see thats the thing about plans no matter how perfect however brilliant or audacious well they can still go to shit and once that happens its all downhill from there oh hey hey think thats him has to be lets go close enough lift up your shirt turn around im unarmed approach slowly hands out  you told nobody about this  and you werent followed you headed north to yumbo and

for the cali cartel only  miles separates prized for centuries by smugglers cruise ships filled with old people and what doesnt get smuggled through way back some enterprising dutchmen set up a financial system their economy is so dependent that you can make an arrest di strea bank cura√£ao of course where do you think all right we tail him and then  yeah thank you okay lets go good morning

dump  the boys are here do not leave this apartment everything youve done for these people yeah got it thanks stoddard all right last hit he was deputy chief of security all right so that much is true had a degree in engineering business license for a biodiesel factory  wonder why served under a carlo c√£¬≥rdova major who became head of security must have been how he got the job wonder if he clipped his old buddy and he was connected to the purchase oh just that does that sound like the everyman  to protect miguels family to you so hes a scumbag last i checked scumbags i can handle so when he calls back  how you want to play it we ask the hard questions im telling you theyre done gilbertos looking and you heard about this thing and miguels in charge of everything here better said the cali cartel is dead and you intend to to do whatever i have to do which is why im talking to you its funny how things change isnt it so amado what do you say i say youre no fucking fun but we both

the north valley you look like a hero i had to do my job youre still not telling us they killed the guy i replaced and they killed his wife and theyre gonna do the same thing and you two are the only ones that can yeah then we need to trust each other  yeah tell me you know where miguel is this is a skypager all right well be in touch over  people were killed with dozens more injured in a shootout

and when that happens its almost thats when people get desperate and things get dangerous i want to welcome pacho chepe im sorry its under these circumstances north valley attacked us their intentions were clear they saw us weak with me in charge they are trying to destroy us take whats ours i all of us know theres only one way to react against these people what weve worked so hard to build war this is gilbertos decision its mine  fixed  synced by bozxphd enjoy the show on the road from galilee christ came upon a beggar christ asked him if hed taken before yes the man said hed taken what he felt hadnt been given christ asked him christ asked him give him some boss i think i know whose car this is my name is pacho herrera i want gerda salazar until that happens is that clear make sure orlando henao gets the message and now pray pray war had returned to colombia cocaine cartels are about succession the number two guys realize that so they decide to speed things up with gilberto rodr√£guez in jail and blood begets more blood i told you that cali ran their empire well when your business gets too big cali basically allowed traffickers to work under the umbrella to use their cocaine distribution network and to take advantage of their muscle in return they demanded loyalty and for a long time that was cool but as brilliant it didnt take into account that north valley cartel traffickers like iv√£n urdinola henry loaiza gerda salazar and the north valley boss orlando henao they didnt need to retire they controlled not only but the port of buenaventura from which most of the worlds it was the jewel in their crown and they did business lets just say they didnt give a shit fuck the gentlemen of cali with the port and calis they had a shot at taking over it is often said in organized crime war is bad for business unless its won buenaventura is in henaos territory we have to get the port back you think that can it be done negotiating with the government it all means one thing our allies and enemies think were weak my brother gilberto hows alvaro what do you want me to say miguel the doctors still dont know hes  years old i swear to you pacho you know where miguel is its not that simple jorge this kind of operation wait a minute very few and nobody knows your name were gonna arrest and you can put all this behind you  can i ask what your plan is  when transpos three trucks no thats not gonna work miguel has they see anything unusual thats miguels assistant theyll be out so then help us find theres no blind spots  what about if we hit at shift change guys thats it thats the plan christ have your entire team take carrera diez ill post a man there youre putting a lot of faith in this guy ill be posted there theyre gonna kill me  theyre gonna kill my family my kids next time we see you were putting you youre getting out with miguel rodr√£guez in charge were dealing then maybe you this operation could significantly impact stop the bloodshed based on information  well due to the sensitivity but gentlemen to ask me to sign off you havent given me anything how much can you trust this informant or is that too much to ask i understand your frustration but ive been assured if you wont tell me what you have  a small team no more than ten men  ill authorize him to provide you one we were hoping you would provide if you would shall i assume you have someone in mind general serrano sir agente pe√£a another setback and i wont be able the case for the surrender deal and you and your team will be gone i appreciate your honesty sir thank you minister through intimidation and corruption the cali cartel had effectively taken much monastery of el carmen and bent them to its will but there was one force it couldnt bend a man named general jos√£ serrano whose faith and integrity agent pe√£a nice to meet you serrano took two things seriously his service to god and his belief in the rule of law he expected the same from his men for him it began at an early age he was a campesino he had never owned a pair of shoes one day a group of mounted policemen it reminded him of the holy knights religious warriors on a mission from god he knew then that he would be one of them he joined the force expecting but instead he found corruption from where he could he rooted it out when he became chief he fired over twothirds of the department antinarcotic police declaring war on corrupt cops i will put into fighting corruption because when there is corruption there is no procedure twenty years numerous he was still waging his war by the book of course this informant of yours is he close to miguel rodr√£guez hes provided us with miguels location thats why its urgent we move now may take a miracle only god creates miracles its for us to use the tools hes bestowed any chance gods bestowed the right men god has many soldiers mine are honest men im not concerned about them gilberto rodr√£guezs arrest from now on any warrant i sign has to be filed which the cartel will know about possibly truth is your tactics just have to find new ones general your men general where are they now awaiting their orders the target is miguel rodr√£guez our operation will succeed because you fulfill your duty to your god and to your country understood yes sir the operation from a strategic theres a security perimeter as soon as the lead team hits the lobby agent feistl and i will be well land on the roof  were going to box them in we have an inside man hell be posted right here which one do you want  this one girls please get ready

about the cartels influence so that government went on the defensive and we have total agreement that we have heard from mr pallomari  thank you very much it would be most helpful if the colombian was as dedicated to fighting narcotics in his own government the us house and senate turning colombia from an ally threatening to choke off that served the shadowy interests and that scared people enough to see justice finally done well governments dont work that way know how many times ive gotten a call from the department of justice count em on one finger guess we have you to thank for that im

the dojs not going to topple you cant tell me some part of me well you should tell that part no i mean it agent pe√£√¢a you played the system you won yes sir another deal a compromise a charade a way for governments about the war theyre supposed to go on pretending theyre winning it but it cant be won itll never be won at least not until people see it not until they know the truth you know what it means therell be a price to pay press the button lets start with your name and occupation javier pe√£√¢a dea attach√£√¢ in colombia and so the truth got out the news that the cali cartel had donated in exchange for virtual immunity turned colombia upside down and when the highestranking dea agent and said not only did but we allowed it to happen they couldnt hide from it anymore an exclusive interview he accuses the country he said the country his words have not been well received the public is demanding you didnt really call a narcodemocracy are you saying it isnt  the state departments livid theyre responsible we all are samper is not going anywhere well at least people know the truth i want you gone pe√£√¢a i understand sir you know just got dragged behind the barn and shot i resigned from the dea this morning recordings that link the president with narcotrafficking have been leaked the reality is  uhhuh  we have it yes thats done this scandal threatens elected president if the authorities confirm his campaign president samper colombians can be certain that if they prove the deposit wouldve been made the colombians and it set into motion that finally brought the reign chepe santacruz without the governments guarantee chepe decided that prison and so he released himself and set out in search of new alliances with partners who could help him you wont believe who he chose don chepe i was happy to get your call predictably it seems the casta√£√¢os expected than chepe was comfortable making so the alliance died quickly and chepe santacruzs wild ride pacho herrera didnt fare much better vendettas in the drug game never end and pachos war on the salazars made him some lifelong motherfucker and as for political pressure from the us who needed to prove brought back the only effective weapon all out of favors they will spend the rest of their lives the good guys didnt do much better betrayal pays back in colombia the danger that he put himself in and in the states despite testimony that he was instrumental to our efforts to he still had to plead guilty and from there jorge salcedo the guy who had the most to do disappeared into somewhere in the us a

me when my business with kimber is done the guns will be returned then i am in your hands completely you hold all the cards but i hope to god that my dismissal doesnt come before your decision i say this for your sake if i were to be fired i would do things that would my fury is a thing to behold on my last day in power for example i would see to it that you have your heads stoved in and your sister too that baby inside her the only one to be spared would be your little brother finn he would however and dumped into that part of the where men have most appetite for that would be a dark day indeed if my dismissal comes do you understand and know this the clock is ticking stanly its the police youre under arrest mate look what we found it seems stanly chapman really mr chapman youre fucked he still refuses to say where im sure with a little persuasion including the whereabouts sir i thought you had done a deal oh is that is what you thought well you gave your word my word do

chosen i am chosen im chosen can the chosen one smoke a vacancy has appeared chosen by whom by an informed consensus i have things to do so perhaps you could tell what hes been chosen for from now on mr shelby you shut your fucking gypsy mouth fuck i need the area round clear of coppers between right could i ask why well whatever it is youre the firemen go out thats all you can go ive got some information no charge theres an old friend of ours hes just passing through he says very grand these days hes head of some the irish desk so i doubt hell be bothering ill say good night tom i demand to speak a representative of father father it was the ulsterman get the fuck off me you must reconcile yourself i demand to speak to a representative make your peace with god a representative of  father now wait does someone here have major campbell about time i am a very busy man governor in seven and a half minutes the man in that cell the murder of an irish activist does the case ring any bells no governor i hear no bells since yesterday morning hes been claiming that the murder by the british its a little late dont you think he was told if he kept there would be a lastminute pardon which has not materialised forgive me governor but what business is this of mine he says the man who hired him was an intelligence service an ulsterman carries a cane a bullet wound in his right leg no still no bells governor you have a very clear remit part of that remit is of executions and in the next four minutes it is to the gates of hell is that clear and if you should ever have to discuss this matter i know where you live arthur tommys arthur he just beat the shit out of i had to take half the kid away arthur  come on sit down finn  where the bloody hell is tommy all right then whisky left over from the explosion its good stuff as well right before tommy gets here i think theres a few things between the rest of us you think yeah yeah i do i want to know when did we all take a vote you have anything to say you wait for thomas pollys fucking right i see all the books legal and off track sort of stuff you dont see and in the past year the shelby company limited has been making √¢ a day right a fucking day sometimes more so what i want to know is why are we changing things polly look whats happened already we havent even set foot and theyve already blown up  who said anything about cockneys do you know who did it do you no she doesnt know who did it im told only family everyones allowed to speak on your feet esme i speak for our household  so a modern enterprise and believes in on your feet esme im not a blood member but perhaps indeed i can see things so ill get to my point that would be nice as my husband said shelby company limited but london i have kin in shepherds bush its more like wars and the coppers fight and there are foreigners and the use of bombs i have a child blessed with the shelby family i want john to see him grow up i want us to someday live somewhere and keep chickens or something but london is just smoke thomas thats all i have to say that was a lot of words wash them down with a nice drink thank you esme firstly the bang in the pub understood the bang is something secondly weve nothing to fear so long as we stick together and after the first few weeks nine tenths of what we do in london the other tenth is in good hands thats right now some of you in this room fair enough any of you who want no part walk out the door right now go raise your chickens for those of you with ambition the expansion process tomorrow im company treasurer its newmarket tomorrow we have  staff who you trust with  quid takings i changed the combination so whats going on thomas whod you meet at the black lion give me the combination polly polly

opportunity the italian gangs have been at war in london its not our war the jews have been having  yeah but we dont at the southern end the jews control camden town your mother said its his cleverness noone gets killed polly we go down tomorrow when its quiet if alfie solomon well negotiate the use and then our legal activities now please open the fucking safe do you know it was a fine

seat how is your company treasurer polly  why do you ask you like to play with fire dont you mr shelby yesterday in belgravia field marshal russells an incendiary device was which means that he will have to find for at least the next three months which also means that your plan for me to break in is now no longer indeed but if you think a wee burn  think again by god you will i will shoot your field marshal but i will do it in a way the only purpose is my purpose i will carry out your assassination listen to me all operational detail im a soldier ive experience now that man has hour your

you have someone the horse will come fifth or sixth mr churchill was impressed he has asked that the colonial office i want my son out of prison now he can be freed im talking about i will carry out at a place of my choosing epsom derby day my name is thomas shelby and today im going to kill a man today is derby day the murder will take place at the epsom races it may be that i am able to escape the odds are not good ive been forced by agents of the crown in the event of my own death my family are innocent who are we lets go and while some of them ive not shared details of this mission and no company assets were used agents of the crown joined forces to arrange this murder i believe the governments intend therefore the bullet i fire will be the starting gun the man i have been is field marshal russell formerly a black and tan commander in the county of cork there is no remorse in my heart however the conspiracy is cause for international concern such is the gravity that after i have served my purpose do you want tea i therefore want to name the agent who has initiated is major chester campbell of he chose me for this dirty business prompted by hatred of long standing in the event of my death it is imperative if you are reading this i hope that living as you do you will be able to make the above facts yours sincerely thomas shelby did you one anyway you ignorant git ada sit

for this purpose  you cant read  its swan lake yeah apparently its about love polly says that for now love must defeat revenge as a result of the greed and the excess of a small number of bankers

influence with the governor they went to prep school together apparently look the closer it gets the more im worried that the bottom is going to fall out of this whole thing well maybe its time you arranged a visit with the good bishop then look in one month it will all be over the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words and so should you good day gentlemen may god be with you michael why im getting you out of here burrows roll it up happy hours over its impossible not if you design the place it isnt too formal too greeting card we gotta make a decision sooner or later you know we have time we dont actually i mean at some point we gotta pull the trigger on this thing i dont want to rush this

come around for a conjugal on tuesday shes always calling me beforehand letting me know shes coming this time man i aint heard a peep you spooked her scofield get it together pope wants to see you no good fish no one gets an audience with the pope not unless hes real interested in what you got going on top of your class at loyola magna cum laude in fact i cant help wondering what someone with your credentials is doing in a place like this took a wrong turn a few months back i guess you make it sound like a traffic infraction like all you did was turn the wrong way up a oneway street everyone turns up one sooner or later the reason i called you here i noticed in your ifile under occupation you put down unemployed thats not true now is it i know youre a structural engineer scofield shah jahan built the taj majal as a monument to his undying love for his wife my wife is quite fond of the story it appeals to the romantic in her being married to someone in corrections terrible job wouldnt wish it on anyone and yet in  years my wife has never complained and the worst part about it is ive never thanked her so because i couldnt say it i thought you know i could build it come june its our th anniversary but here look you see the problem is i build anymore its all gonna come down like a house of cards thats where i was hoping you could be of assistance for the favor i can offer you three days of work a week in here and itll keep you off the yard i cant do it son its better for me to owe you one in here than it is for you to owe me one i can promise you that ill take my chances then were through here guard two pounds of pot what were you trying to do set a record its not funny lj you could be going to jail its pretty obvious to me you need some guidance hey thanks

have a father it wasnt an immaculate conception honey trust me maybe its time we went and saw him mom ma dont im about as excited by the prospect as you are but somethings gotta give you have got too much potential to be screwing up your life like this what if theyd sent you to taylorville or marion and not here i think id be doing the same thing im doing here eating jello drinking koolaid i know what youre doing its not luck of the draw that youre in here with lincoln you forget i know you both of you you two have the most dysfunctional idea of love ive ever seen what he beats you up to keep you off the streets so you get yourself tossed into fox river with him to what save him i deserve to know i loved him as much as you did past tense for you maybe not me i gave him a shot when i got back from college i did even with all the stuff that was going on with him i did everything i could to make it work and he threw it away you ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place dont do this whatever it is youre doing dont do it theres a better way im already appealing your case i told you to leave alone ive gotten in touch with the diocese about lincoln the bishop that wont stop it itll only delay it you want to do something you find out whos trying to bury him nobodys trying to bury him the evidence was there the evidence was cooked visiting hours are now over take care of yourself someone wants him dead veronica something more is going on here this is desperation michael youre grabbing at straws youre in denial maybe but i cant watch him die i wont do that gentlemen what is it about the burrows situation that i can help you with its our understanding that you have great influence with the governor i wouldnt say its great or influence were friends its also our understanding that you oppose the death penalty im a man of god how could i not in this case were hoping youll suspend that position at least temporarily if the inmate appeals to me for intervention how can i turn my back on him you have a habit of answering a question with a question and you have a way of asking questions that beg more questions are you saying you wont do it im not a man to equivocate youre what  years old now your excellency thats right i would assume then that youd be wellversed in how our governments tax system works taking personal capital gains under the churchs tax shelter well that would be fraud wouldnt it your excellency i will not be cowed into forsaking my beliefs not by you or anyone else admirable good day excellency mr kellerman what is it about this case that the secret service is so interested in the man killed the vicepresidents brother  whatd he say someone found fibanacci im looking at the photos right now son of a bitch has a beard sunglasses witness protection if i ever saw who was this someone theres no return address on the envelope just this foldedup bird made of paper like origami yeah like that like origami youre

for the guy because hes got brains in his head and hes helping you with that contraption in there but the guys a violent criminal he deserves punishment just as much as the rest of these guys you have been here long enough to know that im less interested in punishment than i am in rehabilitation and sticking him in with haywire is not rehabilitation in my book you delegated authority over gen pop to me boss i know i did then you either got to let me do my job or pass it on to somebody else now brian go easy theres a reason im giving you more and more responsibility when i retire im recommending you to take my place dont make me regret it all  im saying is take another look at the scofield situation i trust your judgment yes sir whoa whoa wait wait hold up this is supposed to be

sentence i cant wait ten years i cant wait ten years baby im going to be out in  months okay well what if something does happen huh baby i cant wait that long i cant im sorry i got to go hello ba wait hello hel even if leticia barris turned up again her testimony would be worthless by and large most junkies with criminal records dont shine on the stand maybe but i just found all this out in the past couple of days im confident that i can find out a whole lot more now that im devoting all my time to the case the secret service agent who came to visit you when leticia was in your office what did he want nick please youve got to understand ms donovan unless theres new information you can provide for us weve already reviewed mr burrowss case thoroughly do you have any new evidence no but i but that is effectively what youre telling us right i need to clarify here yes that is what im telling you but look mr forsik you dont need to point out what i dont have im well aware of that im here asking for your help because i dont think an innocent man should be killed for something he didnt do and i believe thats what it says on your mission statement in the lobby we get thousands of requests for representation im sure you do and i have to decide which cases were going to devote our very limited resources to i will do all of the legwork mr forsik but since i dont have any experience in death penalty cases im just asking you to point me in the right direction please im sorry we just dont have the manpower thank you for your time  shes just leaving now figure itll take her at least a half hour to get across town in this traffic im not going to need nearly that much time ive turned up quite a bit already hey have you seen my toothpaste it was right here havent seen it i always put it in the same place im sure itll turn up the tattoos theres a maze get away from me i need to see them just you got to show them to me its pulling me in i said get away from me okay hes got a maze on his skin yeah hes got a maze on his skin why why would he do that why why has he put a maze on his skin um i dont ow how are your contacts in chemical lockup depends whos asking i need a bottle of drain line root control sooner than later got weeds growing in your cell just one you the one who was looking for me yeah i wanted to ask you some questions about the lincoln burrows case yeah im veronica donovan im representing lincoln on his appeal what about it you were the first one to respond to lincolns apartment the night of the murder right thats right look id really appreciate if you could just tell me exactly what you saw dispatch called in with a tip that burrows was seen running from the garage where they found terrence steadman so we went over to burrowss place we spread out entered he bathroom thats where i saw your client washing out the bloody pants police hands up i dont need to tell you it was steadmans blood do i in the report that you typed up that night you said that you saw lincoln standing in the bathroom thats all later you testified that you saw him washing the pants which one is it does it matter did you actually see him washing the pants or not yes he stood up turned around his hands were all wet looking guilty as hell your testimony factored into his conviction you know that right you know lady if you got any other questions just go through the department miss donovan i didnt mean to scare you what are you doing here nick savrinn with project justice i know who you are but what are you doing here look my boss may not think lincolns case is worth looking into but i do theres a quicker way to take care of your problem theres smarter ways too what stood out for me was that most death penalty cases take ten years to exhaust all appeals lincoln got there in three so for it to be expedited there had to have been some sort of political influence right well given that terrence steadman is the vice presidents brother thats not too hard to believe how though they got to every judge that rejected lincolns appeal doesnt take a judge all it takes is a little special attention from one of his clerks but how lincoln got fasttracked doesnt interest me its why if he was set up then why i think the answer to that might lie in the victim what do we know he was the ceo of ecofield right he was pushing alternative energy successfully pushing alternative energy so oil companies the saudis even our own government a lot of people stood to benefit with steadman out of the picture whyd you wait till now to take up this case i thought he did it like everybody else i just hope its not too late very well may be you need to prepare yourself for that what about you why death penalty work my father did  years for a crime he didnt commit i know firsthand that when the government gets you in their crosshairs you stand very little chance thats why now do you want my help  i want back in ill do anything you need you see these hands theyre digging machines you want to go to china ill get you to china ill dig like a psychotic rodent if i have to fish i gotta be back in as of right now there is no in van gogh over there is my new cellmate but youre going to do something about it right  youre gonna get rid of him youre my boy so how you gonna do that well lets just put it this way someones going to get hurt howd we miss this guys scofields father was out of the picture by the time he was born took his mothers maiden name all right scofield had no priors and a fulltime job as an engineer correct then he goes and robs a bank discharging a gun in the process so that in sentencing he maneuvers his way to fox river where his brothers scheduled to die in less than a month obviously something is up all due respect brothers are incarcerated together all over the country it may just be a coincidence move on the younger brother do it preemptively before anything rises up bites any of us in the ass its a pathway where does it lead where are you taking me what are you nuts officer i need an officer what the hells the problem down here what son of a bitch open up on  hes got the pathway on his body it leads

the gun  dumped the gun storm drain van buren and wells nobody ever found it all right well what do you do after that you go back to your apartment yeah i was freaking out trying to figure out what happened then i saw the bloody pants in the tub the cops they busted in a minute after i got there the pants the ones with steadmans blood on them first cop on the scene says he saw you washing them in the bathtub hes lying my hands were wet after splashing water on my face police lets see your hands hands up i never touched those pants which brings us back to the gun the one you said you dumped it was planted its the only way it could have got there ballistics matched to a slug the gun was planted it was planted just like the pants your fingerprints were all over the gun bo whos bo hes the guy who arranged everything had me come around the night before tried a few guns see which one felt right that was the setup right there one of those must have been the murder weapon thats how they got my fingerprints on the gun had to be all right so this this this bo uh he coerces you into doing this all to clear a  debt he was going to kill my son well a lot of i didnt do it and those dont count for much security tape the one that shows lincoln pulling the trigger  you got it right well if lincolns telling the truth then that tape is lying think we should have a look decide for ourselves youre clear if the chemicals can eat through the iron pipes how come they cant eat through the toothpaste tube its only when the chemicals are combined that they become a corrosive you study chemistry or something not in school but what youre doing up there in the infirmary what does it got to do with what were doing here getting through this wall is just the beginning theres a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls infirmarys the closest building to those walls and the weakest link in the security chain cool i think ive got enough grout out to bust through im going to need you to make some noise is that the best you can do have some faith papi have some faith shut up you suck not one more word next inmate that opens his mouth goes in the hole were good you okay work its fine i got it everything all right couldnt be better you want to come in we just sat down to eat no i just wanted to stop by to tell you in person problem solved whats this that is a transfer request michael scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow have a good night transcript raceman wwwtvsubtitlesnet  previoulsy on prison break i didnt kill that man michael the evidence says you did i was set up put down your weapon i find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell im looking for someone guy named lincoln burrows man killed the vice presidents brother why you want to see burrows so bad anyhow cause hes my brother im getting you out of here its impossible not if you designed the place it isnt youve seen the blueprints better than that ive got them on me you find out whos trying to bury him nobodys trying to bury him the evidence was cooked theres a lawyer poking around anyone thats a threat is expendable im going to kill that scum you wont you kill him you kill our express ticket out of here whatre you doing here wheres maricruz shes with me now fish i gotta be back in nick savrinn with project justice my boss may not think lincolns case is worth looking into but i do when do we get started getting through this wall is just the beginning theres a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls that is a transfer request michael scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow i assume this is about your transfer request for michael scofield more specifically why you denied it look mr kellerman do i come into your house and tell you where to put your furniture were just asking for professional courtesy but youre asking for a federal courtesy in a state penitentiary most people in your position would be happy to have another body taken off their hands these men are my responsibility from the minute they walk through those walls to the time that theyve paid their debt to society im responsible for them which means that unless mr scofield has done something i dont know about he is going to stay here at fox river under my watch mr pope in our line of work weve discovered that just about everyone has done something that someone doesnt know about whats this right now just a piece of history whether it becomes a current event now thats up to you my wife already knows about toledo does she really youre a smart man warden im sure if you look hard enough you could find a reason why michael scofields presence is no longer required at this particular correctional facility could use more pvc here boss boss sure thing burrows but hey i dont want to check your trunk for splinters i want every piece accounted for sure i got a ripped fertilizer bag inside hey you you get in there and clean it up before this whole place starts smelling like san juan hey hes on his way you mind telling me what this is all about these are the guys were breaking out with i dont think so fish that was not our agreement im not going to work with this crazy rhino keep pushing it john yeah i keep pushing it you know huh whats your deal man touch my brother again and ill show you brother your brother weve only got a few minutes were gonna spend them spitting on each other or are we gonna talk some business the reason were all here today is we have a decision to make  yeah if were going to pull this off we need to take one of them out and you want us to tell you which one i just want you to help me get to them ill take it from there youre crazy you know that all i need is five minutes oh you wont even get five seconds thought you had everything worked out fish were not breaking out of a jamba juice gentlemen its gonna take a little more than digging a few holes there are eyes ears dots that couldnt be connected from the outside and english fitz and percy one of those dots how exactly are you supposed to pull this off with a little help from my friends sucre hold up scofield you got company why do i get the feeling that theres more to you than meets the eye scofield anything you want to tell me some other reason youre in here besides holding up a bank youre being transferred w hat were moving you over to statesville you cant do that yes i can im the boss here this is my house three weeks what for lincoln burrows hes being executed in three weeks well  im aware of that whats that to you hes my brother when i knew i was being sent to prison my attorney petitioned the doc so you could be near him thats right dont take that away from me not until its over im not the one behind the transfer youre up against much bigger fish than me ill arrange for you to say goodbye you ship out tomorrow im going into the walls tonight see if i can access the roof you going to tell me about the transfer im taking care of it youre taking care of it sounds to me like youre reaching maybe a little a little you know i had made my peace to what was coming and then you show up and give me the one thing a man in my situation shouldnt have hope and now thats gonna be taken away  dont do this linc what do you want me to do hmm come on michael what do you want me to do bring her back you know i cant do that but look theres some stuff that i can do its not gonna be the same but were gonna figure it out and no matter what its still gonna be me and you okay but what if something happens to you you just have a little faith just have a little faith all right heres the deal we believe lincoln this tape is a lie it has to be you saw it its all there yeah but maybe what were looking for is whats not there okay steadman you see whats he looking at car a pedestrian no no no his eye line is too high right its like hes looking right into the camera might as well be saying cheese  now he just sits there  waiting for someone there thats a nine millimeter shouldnt there be some kind of kick or something lincolns pretty strong yeah but strong enough to bury a recoil no you shoot someone supposedly for revenge do  you take the time to go back in and hit the glove box or you just get the hell out of there fed said he was trying to make it look like a robbery look look at lincolns angle as he leaves the frame mmhmm walks away from the car now this guy who conveniently hides his face from the camera he comes back in why to explain the bloody pants theyd already planted in his apartment  nick this is great who should we go to nobody yet i mean to the unbiased eye were just backing a horse that died in the gate a lot of what ifs and conjecture you know we dont have anything we need some evidence look if if lincoln didnt fire this gun then somebody with some serious skills went to work on this tape to prove that he did fine but how do we prove that i know a guy you know a guy yeah i know a guy thanks seems we need to have another powwow theres been talk about you packing your bags dont believe everything you hear im not going anywhere you know i have a really hard time trusting you fish the important thing is that we stay on schedule and english fitz and percy english fitz or percy you want to know which one i think we should take out all due respect i dont need opinions i need answers remember the warden leaves at  tonight so by  were going to need that key and how is this key going to give you the answers ill worry about that you worry about getting the key hey this key better be worth it understand afternoon mr scofield i need to know if theres any way to block a transfer order theres about  ways all right ill take the quickest you file a motion for what they call an interlocutory injunction how long does that take how fast can you write a man can claim almost anything violates his constitutional rights theres environmental issues allergies religious requirements take your pick  what if they dont buy it courts required by law to hear your motion until they do you cant be transferred hell they been trying to move my tired gray behind for ten years god bless the american legal system why do you want to stay in here so badly someone here i cant bear to leave behind i guess that means we got something in common states requiring a physical for lincoln burrows you heard the news didnt you thanks no what theyre brothers  who michael scofield heard it from one of the cos over in gen pop he didnt say anything to you about it no oh must be hard to be here so close to your brother and not be able to do anything to help him whats this more bathroom reading westmoreland again scofield hes blocking his transfer even  if the motion is denied its going to take  days to process and that means all right im going in im going to need your help you mean inin now i thought you were waiting i need to make sure i know how im getting up there so when the time comes yo yo yo in case you didnt notice the lights are all on we got a live studio audience fish how are you going to get around that dont we have some laundry to do just to be clear i aint touching your drawers eyes straight ahead keep it moving keep it moving keep it moving him get him get him get him get off me get him get him get him get off me fish i cant deal with this fish come on yo fish fish youre taking too long bro this aint gonna fly man the ricans we got genetically higher blood pressure you know that my cousin he died from too much stress thought you said your cousin was moving in on your girl thats my other cousin but thanks for bringing that up jackass look the good news is i can get to the roof so what happens now n ow its all about timing this is a topdollar job  do you know who did it people who do this kind of work are ghosts man the guy behind the guy behind the guy you know what i mean you see anything definitive cuts any place that proves the tape mightve been doctored the things clean no footprints i mean usually you peel a video back a couple of layers and anything bogus comes off you know now you see it now you dont but not this one its laced ingrained whoa whoa whoa whoa  you see something the problem with your eyes is that they play tricks on you now but your ears ears dont lie look heres the audio track from the tape  sound pretty true right but noise is a lie see it doesnt just die like that stripped down those levels should be dancing i mean a room that size would give you a a blam blam blam blam you know like one off each wall split second after the other on yours the reverbs bouncing at the same time what does that mean the sound of the gunshot it wasnt recorded in that room would you testify to that oh i uh i dont know tape you gave mes a dupe you know for all i know you guys tampered with it look you want me to testify in court im going to need to get my hands on the original  how are those allergies in your motion you cited chronic um  sinusitis its not an allergy actually its a bacterial infection hmm the moist air from the river along the east wall helps keep me you know clear im impressed not even a week in here and youre already working it like an old con well youve got one up on me warden you know why i needed to file those motions but i have no idea why you needed to transfer me traffic  control scofield thats all traffic control look its coming up on  what do you say we call it a day  i dont think i can do that sir if i let go of this support right now the whole things coming down see the taj was designed using axial force a series of internal forces along a longitudinal axis uhhuh yeah how much longer depends on how long it takes to dry if you need me to leave i can show your secretary how to hold it all right you can stay till it dries therell be a guard waiting outside the door just check in with becky when youre done and shell have somebody escort you back to your cell all right and uh scofield i want to thank you for showing up today i would have understood it if you didnt we had a deal right still thanks my wife is going to love it youre welcome  see you tomorrow sir  good night warden we just happen to be two people who happen to know each other who happen to show up at the same movie theater at what happens to be the same time thats it you know from this angle you look just as good as you did when we first met how about from this one even better  oh those are for your guests guests your associates they said you had a meeting theyre in the den evening warden theres nothing i can do im legally obligated to file every properly drafted motion with the court so that a hearing can be scheduled and how long does that take a month maybe two if theres a logjam im sorry but its out of my hands why do i get the feeling youre not all that disappointed may i ask you a question warden more of an observation really i was looking at the um morgue photos from that boy back in toledo will clayton and my lord if he wasnt the spitting image of his daddy apple fell real far from the tree with that one didnt it fell off the tree fell all over the pavement you son of a bitch your wife gave you a pass on the affair something tells me thats pretty much all the forgiveness shes got left in her bag especially when it comes to an illegitimate child what happened with young will warden get out of my house lose scofields paperwork you gentlemen staying for dinner thanks but i think were on our way judy it was a real pleasure thank you and that just may have been the best iced tea ive ever had warden better do everything you can to hold on to this one i will good is everything all right oh yeah just fine honey i just have a little unfinished work to take care of ill be right in okay its all clear evening lincoln doctor im uh supposed to give you a physical this evening  mmhmm apologize in advance for the heavy dose of irony were about to participate in thats all right just doing your job yeah well letting the state know that youre healthy enough to execute is not why i went to medical school hmm i apologize its okay all right im uh going to need a family medical history from you any ailments or conditions that are hereditary start with your mom hmm cancer liver okay father um split when i was young siblings anyone besides michael fox rivers a small town lincoln people around here dont have a whole lot to do besides time and talk you close we were how about now huh how about now hes been abandoned his whole life dad mom she died young and now me think thats why hes here cause your your death would feel like its happening again i abandoned him a long time ago thats why hes here gates closing its time time oh god here we go again counts in  minutes what are you doing trust me the less you know the better the less i know man you got me in the dark thats exactly where you want to be dont normally find you here at this hour are you uh seeking his forgiveness or advice i really dont know anymore ben all i know is my son will was my responsibility and if id stayed in his life i could have saved his life his death was an accident henry he was a criminal and an addict but he was only  years old his mother made it clear you couldnt be in his life if you werent going to be in hers when you chose to stay with judy you understood that i not only understood it i was grateful for it i told myself i i was respecting her wishes i cursed her under my breath while every day i thanked god for allowing me to wash my hands of of toledo all of it so i ran home to judy i buried the secret but i never got a chance to to bury my my son what kind of a person does that ben sacrifices somebody elses life just to make their own life easier you can argue with me all night believe me i havent got anything better to do but it wont change the fact that i cant just hand out original copies of evidence if you could just take a look oh i dont care if your foil is signed by the attorney general i cant give it to you what if we brought somebody here to watch it your supervisor could monitor him the entire time hed strip down swear on a stack of bibles whatever it takes wait what did you say the docket number was its uh spe whats wrong come with me last night a pipe burst upstairs flooded the place files from over a hundred cases pretty much lost all of them including yours just this room some kind of freak accident count em callahan malinowski pohlen chance graziano scofield sucre scofield get the hell out here

way out impossible fish maybe not check it out i dont get it hes a trustee  why him how does one become a trustee just have a spotless record pretty much counts which means weve forget it mr westmoreland hey michael have you found your cat yet still mia  you can always get another besides its a moot point once shes gone no more pets wouldnt be an issue if still tugging on yup and this is the part where i cause you still i dont think i know the way i see it youre in here doing tolife it would have been  but the car you felony murder rule and here you are hitting that woman was an accident no one accidentally so the question is why would charles westmoreland ten states away from and only ten miles away and why two days before that would someone make a phone call to a stones throw away out of which shortly after flight  was hijacked seven hours after records show charles westmoreland at a free clinic only way to get from portland in  seven hours was in a car breaking every land speed its public record db cooper jumped taking a dive at  feet in a hastily packed parachute might make for a rough enough to maybe even a left knee db cooper wouldve had a car according to dmv charles westmoreland was the as it happens a  chevy nova with the was found abandoned with a blown a mile or two away from where with your stolen car interesting story interesting man but you didnt whats that maybe i did hurt my knee i did steal that car and i did accidentally but how could i have hijacked a when i was in folsom finishing up i hope you arent hanging this cause im not the one thanks for the invite though veronica veronica come on were okay how is this okay nick somebody just tried to kill us i know i was there then act like it okay we just watched a man burn to my god lucasz  my god its okay its okay we just left him there there was nothing we he was dead as soon as i am trying so hard to who these people are how we just walked away from there we did it because these people were now if they think were dead maybe we get a little we figure out what no we should go to the police ive been telling myself the same thing theyre bigger than the police now we go to the authorities is broadcasting to them and then we got that target we cant hide forever no no maybe not forever but i think i know a place we can we just have to go in like i said unless the old mans in and even if it were theres no way in hell theyre just see i already figured that part out and that thing youre doing  using rubber cement can you get some out of there maybe why look theres a coffeemaker ive got a hookup with one if we can get rubber cement in when the burner goes on its a good idea but without westmoreland he doesnt want to be no then what does he want hes gotta want something everybody wants something come on kitty come on yes thats a good girl i dont believe it  thank you whered you find her in the yard by the chapel why do i get the feeling theres not a string just a favor   im not db cooper cause its not gonna take db whats that all i want you to do is take a certain coffeepot into and turn the burner on why lets just say it would be if a fire were to marilyn did you think he im not im the cleanup crew type the type that gets access michael im grateful for this but ive made it a point to keep my nose  years without a blemish if that parole board date ever comes i cant jeopardize that sorry michael thanks though really after what you went i thought you might im fine i uh couldnt find anybody i hope you dont feel i do im uh i really appreciate

popped tomorrow you guys are just going to forget about me yeah heylisten an assassin is trying to hunt us downokay and that tbag character is out in the wind with the keys to the castle we got enough problems without having to worry about this guys ass in jail you shut up okay alex has an alias but if they run his prints theyre gonna find out that hes not if whenthey run his prints theyre going to figure out who he is and that hes not in a supermax like hes supposed to be and then theyre gonna realize were not michael lincs right we dont have a choice we move forward with the plan agent self im an associate of general krantz word has gotten back to the general that youve been pulling information on him why is thatmr self im homeland security its my job to protect people who make attractive terrorist targets people in upper ranks of military people like krantz is there a particular threat i should know about maybe you can debrief me on the situation whats your division you want to give me your clearance level im a hired contractor right welli usually dont make a habit of giving civilians who corner me in underground parking structures classified information okay so if the general has a problem he can call me is there something else you want to say to me i think we got off on the wrong foot im just here to give you a little friendly advice whats that the general he likes his privacy thats all yesso that was wyatt i gotta tell you im not a big fan of almost catching a bullet in my head wellnow you know what its like sohow well do you know mahone i know he wants to take down the company just as much as we do you also realize hes a major liability i mean if wyatt could find me he could find mahone and then people so get him out i told you i cant but i can get to him i meanhe can be touched i dont knowmaybe mahone is a standup guy or maybe he likes to run his mouth to work an angle im not sure but if need be i can get rid of that angle i can eliminate that threat thats not an option ohyes it is okaybecause if a choice has to be made between him or us heyfrank got some good news ohyeah whats that i can cut you a break as easy as that spoke with the manager down at the racetrack said you were spotted with another male caucasian about ten years your junior that sound about right here come the cops i have no idea what youre talking about what was it the two of you were gonna go in thererob the vault grab as much cash and get out someone has to be lookout ill take care of it go look maybe you got a wife to get home to family if youre willing to give me the name of your accomplice i think we can change your charges i thought we worked togetheryou know help each other out youre on your own you holler if you change your mind all rightlets talk about the fifth cardholder the general is requiring all the cardholders to have their cards on them at all times so scuderi will have his cardtoo nowscuderi has major security around his house big fence lots of guard dogs where are the documents these are from the county surveyors office it shows the layout of his property and its proximity to every other house on his street he has surprisesurprise a top of the line electronic alarm system that will alert him if theres a breach in the structure if we cut the power the alarm goes off if we double the power with a voltage spike the alarm system in order to protect itself against an overload will shut itself down and thats how were getting in then what looki know what the score is its every man for himself you get left behind you get locked up tough titties nowi signed on the dotted line like everyone else and i want to know exactly what im doing on this job im with bellick on this one you knowmaybe we should have a plan for when the cops get here cause if mahone squeals theyre gonna come real quick hes a fed how many deals do you think this guys made in his life you think hes just gonna tuck tail between his shut up lookwe can sit here and debate what mahone is or is not gonna do for the rest of the day we cannot break him out of a police station one two threefourfivesix no too big eight by ten this is the lowest gauge i could get its perfect cool i guessuh i guess were gonna leave him in jail is that a statement or a question its just if something happens to alex ifuhif the company finds him if the roles were reversed and you

even in our line of work perhaps mahone is just the tip of the iceberg weve been searching for the link between supermax and burrows and scofield i believe we found it if scofield and burrows are

accident my fee just doubled by the way hello uh hi is this brad yeah uh you came by my office a couple of days ago looking for a guy who had an inheritance coming to him right i know where he is she

symptom of a brain tumor hama hamartoma yeah as a kid she got nosebleeds they stopped in her s they started up again she later died of a brain aneurysm and youre telling me this because michael and

problem dont even think about doing this to me my names on the door if i didnt think you were valuable youd be dead already grab a leg itsits just a little sensory overload guys there just wasnt any room for the card right because if we turn the device on in the casino it fills up on all the data from the slots like when theyre about to pay out oh its completely unintentional really yeah its not why you built the damn thing in the first place if we didnt need you but you do so just take a brewski and chill all right okay we need to figure out a way to get scuderi alone yeah the old man just showed up at the pool from what hes wearing theres no way hes got the card on him stay with him cards in his room tell me donald how did you play this moment out in your head did you picture yourself coming in here chest out jaw squared ready to demand answers did you at any time in your fantasy imagine that you would be this nervous honestly i uh i didnt think much past giving you these berlin nigeria the comrie group why not jfk and the lindbergh baby while youre at it son those matters have been fully vetted theyre relics i had nothing to do with them and if this is why youve been pulling data on me i could have saved you a lot of trouble okay well these records and a sealed letter explaining my investigation into your involvement with these matters was sent to five lawyers across the country if anything happens to me if i go missing anything if i wind up dead that letter is to be unsealed and they will find cold trails that lead nowhere near me it doesnt matter if a government agent who was looking into you is found floating in the la river or whatever else you have planned your life general will change dramatically there will be questions media coverage and surveillance and whatever you and the company are trying to do next with your little laos game or whatever else you have planned itll be next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you okay so back off of me you are not the first person to attempt something like this most of the others i now fondly call my colleagues theyve learned to put their determination and focus to better use and with far greater compensation wrong guy well see dear mr white due to unforeseen circumstances i regret to inform you that i will no longer be able to perform services at gate i thank you for this opportunity im

blueprint the substructure is completely exposed it shouldnt take more than  hours to get in there its only gonna take  hours all we have to do is get that last card first well based on what ive deciphered so far were gonna need aroundtheclock access to gate starting immediately if you can get us some suits and ids we could go in there as irs agents auditing the books i mean considering the kind of racket theyre running nobody would have a problem believing that can you make that happen yeah i could do it its under the can hello we have a lot in common yeah who is this just another interested party in what youre up to yeah whats that scylla open the envelope the pages ive got only go up to  is this more blueprint i dont know what do you want i dont know what youve done with

kamikaze mission on the generals car now that the device is gone your opinion doesnt matter so shut up and pump we know the general travels light one limo and a couple of guards it aint the guards im worried about its the crash look i never said this was going to be easy just relax first off panama was a job some other time what do you want with scylla thats my business were not in panama anymore and im not behind a fence so again what do you want with scylla same thing you want bring down the company great then why dont you give me those missing pages and disappear id love to you remember that day at the roosevelt when whistler made off with liefs card who do you think took the fall for that our names are at the top of the same hit list now i dont know what arrangement you two have but i need some traveling money lets talk about that later why dont we talk about the kind of scum youre willing to put on the payroll give me a way to do it without her and well do it we need the pages its a package deal are we partners partners look i barely dropped a nickel in the slots right this guy was all we ought to blanket party your ass wheres the device can it be salvaged tell him pit boss walked off with it okay well were going to call this your early retirement you can either go upstairs and sit on your cot and ride ut the rest of this thing or i can call agent self and you can ride out the rest of your prison sentence your choice i need to talk to you so your brother told me about your nosebleeds and he told me about your mom that wasnt his place to be worried about you when mom got sick linc was at the hospital every day holding her hand watching her die and he was  it changed him it made him overprotective and now hes jumping to all the wrong conclusions for all the wrong reasons and its its over nothing because im fine you dont look fine well maybe thats because theres something i have to tell you gretchens alive shes working with tbag and they have several pages from whistlers bird book and they want in on scylla self is cutting them a deal as we speak self knows that they have their own agenda but so do we and as soon as we get those pages back gretchen and tbag are going to pay for everything theyre going to get exactly whats coming to them okay this isnt about gretchen its not about any one person and we we have to finish it i need a minute please i cant believe this what choice do we have gretchens on the team like it or not we need those pages another perra were jumping in bed with not exactly new territory for us i dont care who we gotta partner up with we get those papers we make with the breakin we get this job done she could still have ties to the company man i dont know well worry about gretchen when the time is right for now lets focus on the general this thing with gretchen doesnt change a thing were uh were still close closer to scylla farther from wyatt you dont know that just stay focused all right this is my focus okay im doing the job okay all right all right every day the trail to my sons killer gets a little bit colder thats all i do is focus what are you doing um its just uh were going to need that downstairs yeah ill just uh be up here message sent how much for scofield and burrows i see you two have come to an agreement shes on work release just like you what kind of work you and the secretary keep things quiet in the office while michael tunnels to scylla you really think scofields gonna keep his word huh you horsewhipped the woman he loves michael wants scylla just as badly as we do yeah he wanted out of prison too our partnership lasted long enough for that to happen and then we parted ways trust me yeah um go on in sir scofield will use you and then hes gonna bury the knife in your back for what you did to his lady friend mr pfeiffer cole wheres scylla good morning to you too sir gentlemen i gave you three days wheres scylla i now uh mr feng lets not do anything rash so youre feng we havent actually met in person i was the liaison between the company and your chinese employers on operation copperhead susan thats right you went from working for the company to stealing the one thing that could destroy them thats a tight turn with a price that scylla commands on the open market anybody would turn which is by the way  our paths never crossed on copperhead but i did deal with one of your colleagues a lesscapable associate whatever happened to him he was skinned and hung from an overpass oh yes i recall he couldnt deliver on promises made you may also recall that he was my predecessor when i joined copperhead you got what you wanted youll get scylla too if i dont ill peel you like a wet grape and the price is    dont disappoint me well  million well then susan gretchen whatever your name is i suggest you find a way to bury the hatchet with michael scofields woman we got work to do why do i get the feeling that some poor bastard woke up to an empty driveway this morning relax we got it from a scrap yard and youre pinning the hopes of the entire mission on that relic if it was card one id say no if this was card five id say no but its the last card i really think we can stage a hitandrun and get away with it all right we know where this guy works we know his route im gonna wait for him at this intersection he drives through i smash him with my car get the card and if by some miracle you walked away from the crash the generals gonna know that you ripped him off not if i pump him full of morphine first the generals gonna wake up tomorrow morning in the hospital feeling happy as a clam with no idea what happened to him when hes out cold we download the card onto the laptop and put the original back on him and you dont think this is gonna look suspicious for the paramedics that show up at the scene that depends on who the paramedics are at the federal impound lot downtown there are currently four ambulances seized in a drugsmuggling ring all we need is one go make yourself useful time was commanders would assemble their troops before a battle and rehearse schemes of maneuver on a square of dirt using rocks to depict enemy positions they called these

yo i thought this was going to be a legit business transaction okay you dont got my money i dont got the location of the brothers where are they oh god what are you doing what are you doing sara hi sara a former mentor of mine once told me a story that i think applies to this situation at the end of the civil war grants union army had lees confederate soldiers outflanked at appomattox lee understood the futility of more bloodshed so he requested a ceasefire he wanted to bring an end to the fighting soldiers that had been killing each other that morning walked across the lines that afternoon for the first time as allies to trade northern coffee for southern tobacco now i dont expect us to exchange gifts but that doesnt mean we cant be allies of course you cant have a ceasefire without both parties getting what they want you have five minutes put as many scars on my back as possible i dont want to rush you but you have four minutes left what was her name this is a onetime deal sara you want your pound of flesh you take it now what was her name who the guard the one you shot and left to die in my arms thats what this is about a guard that couldnt do her job what was her name what was her name taylor her first name michelle i think you should know that this isnt about me i can handle the scars you put on my back but what you did to michelle i had orders she tried to help you escape she did help me escape she didnt try sara you were too busy making an example out of her to find the key that she left with me then she got what she deserved she saved my life and you took hers you proved your point were even were a long way from even and when this is over youll pay for michelle where are they the thing about a gunshot to the kneecap it takes days to die from it now if i were to shoot you lets say here the hollow point would tumble through you leaving whitehot slivers in your insides causing unimaginable pain only ending when you bled out on this pavement you dont want that do you then tell me where the brothers are theyre in a warehouse pier  san pedro theyre all there please thank you no what are you doing i told you what you wanted no no no all right all right enough youll get your shot now back off alex listen to him hey hey youll get your shot man youll get your shot michael come on he sold us out what are you doing we got to go wait wait wait michael lets go dont hand me any more updates theyre surveilling me theyre coming after me general well get them this isnt the first time someones made an attempt on your life this is not an attempt on my life this is an attempt on my card get wyatt were trying to contact him dont try anything just get wyatt how do you want to proceed i want it moved to make the necessary arrangements for security would take days i dont care about logistics i want it moved move scylla now im sorry im sorry im sorry i know i know im not ready to go man wwwtvsubtitlesnet  previously on prison break what do you want with scylla same thing you want bring down the company we need the pages are we partners partners so your brother told me about your nosebleeds im fine you dont look fine sorry consider this a warning linc pull back its a trap you all right damn youre hit all right all right youll get your shot now back off this is an attempt on my card how do you want to proceed i want it moved move scylla now now tell the general you killed us otherwise my hand it aint going to get tired i just hope your mouth gets tired thats funny come on buddy come on enough already come on linc believe me now beating him isnt going to work lincoln you tried your way we want general krantz to think wyatt took us out even if you do break him it does call the general you dont think a trained military veteran is going to hear the fear in his voice theyre going to know he was coerced yeahwell i need more time with them i hear you linc but he cant make the call if hes unconscious however we do it we better get what we need from wyatt soon because mahone aint going to wait im trying to find the son of a bitch who killed my kid lisa what are we looking at initial estimate is three days to complete the move of scylla unacceptable respectfully this is not as simple as unplugging a laptop and moving it to another room the data on scylla is too delicate i dont want excuses all i care is that its done right and done right now i understand the urgency but it will take three days and if i may speak freely i think its a mistake to move scylla to the raven rock bunker when the los angeles facility is one of the most secure ones we have the most secure location we have is the one they dont know about sir still no word from wyatt he only uses the companyissued cell so we cant track him we have no way of confirming if he successfully completed his operation keep calling him and draft a press release photographs criminal records everything we have on scofield burrows all of them tell our friends in the media i want them to saturate the evening news and the morning papers i want it impossible for them to walk down the streets of los angeles without being spotted i assume we havent made much progress with our friend over there any suggestions how about we talk to him great want to give him some milk and cookies while youre at it no how about just some nice conversation so they sent florence nightingale to get me all ready to cooperate actuallyim here to help youdespite what youve done because im still a doctor and youre a prisoner youre going to save me don self has a metal case out there and i dont know whats in it i imagine you dont want to find out so i figure if you and i had a talk youd make me see the light if you dont call the generalyoure as good as dead ive already

died he died a punk he ratted us outbellick you guysyou deal with the matter at hand assuming these pages are correct and theres no way of knowing that they actually are we follow this basement hallway through the boiler room to here theres some kind of elevated walkway we follow that to the end and weve covered most of the distance between gate and the companys headquarters whats this thing at the end of the walkway i dont know whistler marked it with an x so im thinking its some kind of wall or serious impediment thats why were going down there prepared toolsthermal lancessledgehammers okayso we get through that wall whats on the other side againi dont know its because gretchen has the rest of the pages but once were through this location we cant go any further until she gives them back whats her game in all this i meanif she wants the company to go down she should just give us the pages lookwere going to deal with gretchen when the time is rightokay you guys need to go to gate and get started im going to stay here with wyatt and make sure we get what we need no more dawdlin now move your ass high geargentlemenhigh gear my boss will be here any minute i assume i dont have to mention that discretion is paramount in other wordssilence is golden you just make sure you stay in your office and you keep other people out ohill stay in my nice airconditioned officepretty and you can crawl down into your little hole now go go aheadcrawl vamonos cole what the hell is going on here mr whiteare you back already how are you fineuntil i found a resignation fax waiting for me from andrew blauner a resignation yeahi cant get him on the phone i reached out to his fiance she hasnt seen or heard from him shes worried sick hes probably on a bit of a bender just sleeping it off somewhere blauner hes a boy scout none of this makes any sensecole but ill tell you what im going to look into it let me know if i can be of any assistance good morning assistance what is that sound i hope youre having a lovely enjoyable morning because while you are nowhere to be found there is sleuthing going on here regarding the whereabouts of one mr andrew blauner and and if im going down for this little homicide i aint going alone were going together like traffic and weather relax okay theyll never find the body where i put it now where are scofield and burrows just doing their end of the bargain which begs the question what the hell are you doing me im getting ready for a meeting so your friends have been calling a lot they must be wondering where you are thats right theyre wondering and the longer they do the more danger youre in call the general and say what they want you to say and what youll let me go no but don self will make sure that you spend the rest of your life in a decent facility without the death penalty either way if i make the call or not im dead you know that and we both know that you as a doctor wont let that happen so please lets you and i figure a way out of this mess that works for everybody sit your ass down get out of my way out out i will cuff your ass to that table okay all right i know this is hard and i know what you want to do okay but im trying to do something here and you need to deal with that reality have you lost a kid yeah i did too my wife was pregnant and there were complications and the doctor messed up and she and they both they didnt make it okay so i understand what would you do if you were me and that doctor was right there its right what would you do i dont know what i would do look im giving you my word when the time is right i wont stand in your way when the time is right i wont let you okay okay did you see the way mahone was looking at wyatt the guy is hurting it was more than just hurting thats pain i never cared about anything like that i look at what ive done with my life beating on cons at fox river chasing money trying to keep my own ass out of prison this the pathway you talking about according to the map this runs almost the length of that courtyard it should put us directly beneath company headquarters shh listen there it is again whats that noise scofield i dont know okay just so were clear we get to go up that ladder towards the noise that we dont know what it is but if were lucky we get to basically just walk smack into the company sounds about right you up for it oh yeah after you i am no different than that man over there who wants to kill me alexander mahone was forced to do things by the company and so was i but i know people people in government people that can help you and michael i can give you a phone number arrangements can be made all you have to do is trust me and this will all be over it is over has um white had anything new to say about blauner no but he might mr pfeiffer that would be moi detective conor mara i was hoping i could talk to you about andrew blauner of course great its down this way this is it this is where the sound was coming from one of the main conduit pipes for the la water supply  gallons of water rushing through this very spot every second oh great theres got to be some other way to get around it some other pathway or something no we took the only pathway down and it leads right here how about over it we cant risk tunneling too close to the surface what do we do we dig truth be told uh mr blauner isnt officially a missing person but his fiance has a cousin at the mayors office so here we are here we are hey thats not to say though that there arent some things that concern me really such as well the fax that came into whites office came from a copy shop but blauner had a fax machine at his house okay and about a half hour after he resigned his car was seen leaving the gate garage now the driver couldnt be identified but it appeared as though a womans hands were seen gripping the steering wheel let me stop you right there it always seemed to me that mr blauner was how can i put this delicately um a swordsman you know what i mean actually i dont he might be dipping his snout into a different trough and the fiance is none the wiser from what ive uh heard about him from his other coworkers that doesnt sound too likely if you dont mind me asking what is that banging noise thats uh its trouble with the pipes you know they loosened up it was a moderate quake and now they shake more than the trembler itself mr pfeiffer uh some people here have told me that you and blauner didnt get along would you mind talking to me a little bit about that a few years ago a partner of mine did this same move against an enemy combatant we picked up at the new mexico border this guy didnt want to talk he didnt know anything it worked then it should work now is that ambulance you got us still out back hey come on pal i got almost a decade on you and you dont see me sucking air i got shot brad guys we aint making any progress here theres nothing beneath this cement but granite we couldnt get through it with a jackhammer maybe we should go back to the warehouse find another way there is no other way this is it this is where the plans lead this is our way to scylla what we got millions of gallons of water in this drain pipe we cant go under it we cant go over it i know maybe we can go through it its loose all right linc this ought to do it after im done how much time we got not a lot be careful you too when i was a little boy i had an old tomcat named rufus he was a good mouser tough as nails solid feline all around one day i bring home this little kitty from a giveaway box outside the pic n save old rufus didnt like that one bit he arched his back hissed like a rattlesnake and sprang out his claws like a switchblade you know that new little kitty didnt do nothing wrong but be new now thats all i did i was being new and blauner was being this old tomcat spraying his territory now i dont hold that against him if he didnt protect his turf id question his character but aside from a little jealousy on his part our issues were as thin as tissues i assure you that detective i pulled blauners travel schedule as per your request thank you uh whats this uh sir uh we need to step out for a few more bracketjoints for the shelving uh all right yeah but i aint paying you to stop for uh a coffee and donuts so get back here toot sweet hey wait up manuel i hired some men uh out of my own pocket of course to uh add some builtin uh uh storage in my closet i hope you dont mind heres the monthly breakdown of where he traveled youre gonna talk to me now me no were done talking

should go lets go outside my sons autopsy report said that hed that hed been shot twice once in the stomach why man why just to terrify my wife and then a full five minutes later right in the you too will suffer and when and when you cant stand the pain anymore youll make a phone call for me you know scofield said that torture wouldnt work because the general would hear the fear in your voice but the thing is i want the person on the other end of my call to hear the fear in your voice press release sir in short it sets forth that members of the fox river eight and their accomplices are alive and well in los angeles where have you been they are all dead its over good work your payment will be left where we arranged this is no longer necessary go ahead the access code to the covert entrance is still both your daughters birthdays everyone leave us alone i said everyone leave us alone its okay she wont hurt me lisa i knew youd come home so how are you holding up you know not being with lj and all good hes a smart kid he can look after himself i can see it how much you love him my dad died when i was a little kid but he was a good father lets just focus and get this thing done all right michael said the manual override should be somewhere near the main conduit this look like the main conduit to you one way to find out that look like it to you looks like it fire it up all right lets get out of here hurry up bro almost done buddy all right ease it back it worked how long we got i dont know water cut off to thousands of people the city will probably have that taken care of in about an hour which means weve got  minutes to do  minutes worth of work or we dont get to scylla whats wrong papi mike michael michael whats wrong papi papi talk to me whats wrong talk to me michael michael whats wrong michael you want some water im okay youre alot of things right now my friend and okay aint one of them you know i may not be the smartest guy but i hear things sara and your brother have been talking about you not feeling well or something look im just im just saying i need your help so please just uh cover for me you got it truth is gretchen i know you better than you know yourself so you keep telling me when i first met you you were a  year old girl whod just been dumped by the wheeling police academy for failing her psych evaluation but where those good old west virginia boys could only see an emotional disconnect with traces of sociopathic tendencies i saw a machiavellian streak that would make failure an impossibility i had to let wyatt do what he did because i needed to know what my little bulldog may have known about whistler and his plans for scylla i told you that i knew nothing you should have believed me i knew youd never take it personally because you are and have been ever since i took you under my wing my girl my girl the most sensitive nerve endings are right here thats why acupuncturists avoid placing needles anywhere near them because opening up the nerve endings in the fingertip even a little pinprick can result in quite a painful hot flash so a five inch needle being driven up the length of the finger can make your insides feel like theyre on fire another fact of physiology the human body when in extreme duress begins to shut down brain activity decreases and your heart rate slows until you just cant feel the pain anymore and thats where the heart monitor and the battery come in cause when your heart rate dips below  that battery will give you a wakeup call preventing your body from shutting down and then you will feel every ounce of the pain and thats when youre going to beg me to make the phone call what can i do you for i i found some more inconsistencies in your sales reports listen up here from that little computer of yours can you access into gates records if i access the network as an administrator i can see the files in a nonpdf format i dont know what that means but i assume it was a yes so you let your fingers do the walking across that keyboard and you get me my sales records you are hurting my arm and dont make me hurt any more of you now go thats good work here i need you to measure this hole and then make one of the same size in the wall opposite how you got a belt we have less than  minutes until this pipe is flooded with water again acceptance is important wyatt i had to accept that my son is gone and you have to accept that your life your very very short lifespan ahead of you is just going to be filled with agonizing pain at least until you do what ive asked of you and then then the pain will go away were running out of time aw man whats wrong the stupid thing is empty all right im coming in you cant do this bro just finish it its me whats going on somebody needs to tell you something you call her by her first name pam im sorry its over and i love you i love you this thing is heavy sure show up when all the hard work is done all right ease it back we heard on the radio that dwp is going to have the water running in  minutes you all right the sleeve is too heavy to just slide it through the pipe two of us are going to have to go inside and guide it through that other hole that pipe can flood at any time ill do it ill go too no ill go oh no offense college boy but this suckers heavy youre going to need a little bulk down there all right use this to brace the sleeve when you pull it through to the other side and uh lets get the hell out of there all right hows emmy i didnt come here to listen to you pretend to care about her or me i came here to tell you that im a free agent now the community we run with know that im alive and available i can just as easily work for one of them as i can for you so the question is whats your offer actually the question for you is why would you want to go anywhere else its not a time for grudges gretchen its a time for coming together the salad days are fast approaching laos worked perfectly soon the populace will turn to us the leaders of the military finance and energy to right the ship and then well rebuild this country in our own image and when we do i want you there beside me gretchen as my number two like i always promised what about lisa ive already told you youre my girl come on over there right up there you and i are the same alex ive done things push keep going keep going keep going keep going yeah its good right there you got it thats it i dont know how long thats going to hold all we got to do is pull this thing through oh my god come on guys push oh it broke it broke mr white im sorry to bother you but uh after my talk with detective mara i was thinking about mr blauner and some of the conversations we had salesmen are a lot like fishermen right always bragging about their big catch well andy never talked about his sales no matter how much i pried so i took the liberty of looking them up and there were to say the least irregularities tbag good afternoon to you too andy two of your top buyers dont have valid social security numbers i checked out the social security numbers of the clients he allegedly sold gate workshops to in some cases the numbers are just pure fabrications but the checks mustve cleared hes mustve been money laundering for god only knows what kind of criminal exploits the point is if the good officer gets his hands on these papers you know youre going to be up to your eyeballs in irs auditors i suggest you go tell mr mara that you found some irregularities in blauners expenses writing off personal matters et cetera this will explain why he disappeared and will placate the popo okay listen detective pick it up pick it up i cant its too heavy the brace must have snapped lets try and get it up its not moving the waters coming the waters coming come on we got to leave it there but then well never get scylla we dont have a choice you dont i do what the hell are you doing what the hell are you doing brad dont do this brad grab it grab it now the waters coming get your ass up here now come on come on you hear that theyre flooding the pipe linc get out of there its too loud he cant hear you linc come on man theres still enough room for you to get through the hole i let go of this you could drop it its too heavy brad drop the sleeve and get out of there dont do this you have a son dont do this dont do this push it push it scofield come on push it through push push it push it push it brad brad no brad no brad brad brad no brad brad you can all come back in now everythings fine it always was youre okay couldnt be better more important whats happening with scylla ill tell you in private you can tell me in front of gretchen not until i say something else if you ever come near him with a gun again youll what that will do scylla we got preliminary safeguards in place faster than we expected we could move scylla tomorrow if we wanted but now that wyatts eliminated scofield and burrows theres no need scofield and burrows are dead dead as latin go ahead with the plan if a couple of boys from illinois could get that close its time to mix things up i want scylla out of los angeles by the end of the day tomorrow he wouldnt climb up he just wouldnt climb up where does the south pipe lead to maybe we can follow no wwwtvsubtitlesnet  previously on prison break if youre successful with obtaining scylla youll not only avoid jail time but you could take great pride in knowing you helped dismantle this countrys greatest threat to its own democracy if youre killed while doing so a proper funeral will be provided gretchen has the rest of the pages we cant go any further until she gives them back why are we doing this again its an insurance policy you put a gun on me again and these arent the only set of prints ill be copying mike michael whats wrong talk to me michael i want syclla out of los angeles by the end of the day tomorrow brad get out of there push it dont do this brad no if anything should happen call my mom in chicago nothings going to happen wheres brads body now we got it on its way to the morgue and its in the cooler at homeland security where nobody can find it that aint part of the deal you said if anything happened to us that wed be returned to next of kin no thats not exactly what i said no that is exactly what you said no it isnt exactly what i said okay and he needs to stay a john doe until i say otherwise okay im dealing with enough stuff already and ive had my ass chewed out hes got hes got a mother you know if you want scylla and i assume you still do brad bellicks body

to a bunker in pennsylvania when tomorrow you want to make sure to mention that on the phone right away as soon as you know for an exemployee you sure seem to know an awful lot about current company business dont get paranoid im keeping one ear to the ground for your benefit which is a really good reason to work with me and not against me all right you know what we got our pages lets go thats enzen from transpo hes responsible for the power transfer and you know powell hes supervising the security override its a big job perhaps we should call in david baker just to be safe that wont be necessary we can do this all inhouse huh and scylla will be gone by morning i promised brad i would call his mom if anything happened ill do it if you want no its okay ill do it look at this he kept a badge from the police benefit when he was a co in fox river hehe failed the test to get into the academy five times these are right right thisis a map of the companys basement right i dont know it looks too simple i assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this these symbols theyre they dont make any sense and the letters uh theres just something wrong this letter c it usually designates some kind of heating vent the m designates a meter this is some sort of condensing unit this is a plumbing part its called a ptrap theyre all completely dissimilar items logical design dictates theyd never be installed that randomly it just um it doesnt make sense c m e c m e c m e c m e thats see me these letters dont make any sense if you think of them as symbols but they do if you think of them literally do you see me hes asking if you see him where here david baker yeah but who besides you two would come up with something like that huh i mean whats the point i dont know but were never going

on stage two the plates and the facility are ready to print as much currency as we need at any time when will scylla be installed in pennsylvania lisa whats our timeline actually theres been a bit of a problem dismantling the security surrounding scylla is a bit tricky it may take longer than we thought how much longer i can make this happen right now yesgeneral go get david baker yes sir yes uh

can manage it we just need to know what were dealing with what if i dont want to know kevin freling should only take a few minutes you ready im ready my goal is to build one city that entirely selfsustains depending on no outside resources a community living entirely in harmony how close is it to becoming a reality well thats a matter of opinion people look at something like this and they think its impossible in reality i could make it happen tomorrow like what they built in dubai exactly grand ideas brought into reality this wont just serve the rich how long have you been working for them too long i came in in  i was never good at collecting a paycheck always freelance partially retired all the time i like to finish a job and then move on put it in the past do you always leave your name behind instead of the correct specifications only on the scylla project well were considering modifications and i was hoping that you could help me figure out what should really appear on those blueprints as of right now they dont mean much didnt you read the legend sure but we still had a lot of trouble youre not company what should i do stay calm calm you just said im standing on a bomb well work it out you think gretchen set us up the lessons taught by our founder mister harvey hall pathway to personal freedom do people actually buy this nonsense let go of me youre coming with

program you know im gonna tell you a better story about captivity than the regular old spiel years back i was providing volunteer leadership in a local penitentiary i worked with the head guard a big burly bowlegged brat mean as the devil all the prisoners were afraid of him even the murderers and one day brad said to me cole i want you to get out of here i want you to get out of here right now

kevin freling yes i am im dr malden im a neurologist and youre cameron eberline im a an internist do you have the results its gonna take a little while uh looking at the family history id like to admit you here were working on a room just for now until we get the test results back i dont think thatll be necessary but thank you it would be best if you could rest where you could be monitored after that well determine what the best course of action is agreed i think we have to go im sorry hold on hold on how long how long will it take to get the results couple of hours but well get you in a room before then just wait here thank you come on you know what happens they take over your life you dont own it anymore that is not what happened to me then somehow you stayed out of trouble you did what they told you to do maybe thats why you stuck around huh right here in los angeles in my case they had something on me and they used it and they never let me go theyve killed hundreds thousands of people in the pursuit of power you know that we lost a good man yesterday trying to stop them they hurt a lot of people david david look i stay out of the politics it was a job i specialized in security engineering the scylla project was a choice assignment so i took it they told you what it was didnt they they told you what it was and now you wish that you never helped them but youre trapped youre trapped like i was you talk like its all in the present it is i know you want to move on look at what youre doing are you trying to make up for something forget the charitable city of the future and worry about the world that you live in right now david what they did what theyre doing is not my fault you put your name in there for a reason you wanted someone to find you and if you tell me what i need to know i can do something for both of us where is your husband he went to run some errands he should be right back thats his car in the driveway isnt it just a moment ill call him on his cell excuse me you knew about this didnt you first of all i have no idea why the company would want to put an explosive device of any kind under their own building were under the courtyard and you know what i honestly had no idea that any of this was even here that being said these look a lot like jz antipersonnel blast mines back in fallujah the muj used to bury them outside their firm base get rid of them im no expert but i have an idea whats beeping it beeps wow you mustve stepped on this just right your weight is evenly distributed across the pressure plate and you havent engaged the firing pin you cant move an inch we know whats your idea well my idea is that he moves an inch that way i can get to the hole and i can dismantle the firing pin right now hes standing on it and i cant do anything no no no linc llama tu hermano what call your brother please you you stay here fine its my brother michael lets go sara youre not leaving are you you have our number and who are you again he prefers to wait at home im monitoring him hes leaving ama in a potentially fragile condition look im not stupid i know who you are and im not gonna turn you in my concern is for whats going on with your health they arent here for you and im telling you in your condition thank you doctor i appreciate your help please do call us can i help you i messed up what do you mean today i was working with bagwell hes been compliant as hell i thought that i would make him happy he wanted to talk about gretchen morgan right and what happened and i slipped up i mentioned whistler this one is tough im telling you bagwell gretchen morgan theyre thugs i have been face down with a gun to the back of my head more than once all right look i dont want you to do something that you dont want to do youre a good agent we could reassign no no that is not it look i can handle this im just im just kicking myself i could find something else for you to do okay this thing has gotten way out of hand dallow is on my back and the company is moving scylla no im fine are you sure i really think we can do this don we can bring the company down ego is the only reason i coded my name into those blueprints i dont feel guilty about anything i gotta take this im sorry hello alex we what got a problem theres a damn minefield down there hello i cant hear you sucres in trouble hes standing on a mine we need to deactivate it linc i gotta go ill call you back theyre here david what do they want from me theyre moving scylla protecting it everything you did for them they want you to do it again you think you can stop them i know all about you ive known about you for six months ever since somebody stole those plans from the company it will never work you wont get past the first wall what about the first wall whats gonna stop me huh the minefield please dont tell em weve got him sweep the area theres a dirt road at the bottom of the hill it will take you out your husband just go he wont help you that will lincoln go call him again linc go call him linc go call him what will michael know about this i mean its not exactly within his realm of expertise were wasting time i gave you a semiprofessional assessment whats wrong you dont trust me fernando why should he because we all want scylla and im not gonna let a giant pack of firecrackers stand in our way or would you like me to call the bomb squad look i am offering to do you a massive favor here if that thing blows while im pulling the pin he loses a leg i lose a face now dont worry fernando im known for my steady hand take a deep breath okay keep your weight even and i need you to shift slowly very slowly one inch to your left so i can get to the pin oh no i cant i cant i cant do it are you all right have you uh heard anything they have to deactivate i got a key a legend to the blueprint baker gave you this no his wife gave it to me they came for baker all right well this makes more sense these uh these symbols arent for ptraps theyre theyre microphones and the letter v isnt for vacuum thats a generator this is a line of jz land mines buried  millimeters underground about seven feet from the outer wall thats must be what linc was talking about it says manual override only all conventional attempts to dismantle the jz will activate the scylla alarms this isnt just a land mine this is uh this is an alarm we cant sit here all night okay you ready hey its linc you know what to do what are you doing linc sucre stop stop dont move dont move dont move you cant dismantle the land mine without setting off the alarm so i either set off the alarm or blow up and die no theres a manual override itll cut the power long enough for you to step off without removing the pin how do you know for sure i found david baker sucre step off you can do it you only have  seconds come on i cant yes you can yes you can michael and i figured it out step off right now no no you guys all go ill we all dont have to die ill do it alone nobodys gonna die today step off step off whats behind this wall scylla when do you find out the doctor is supposed to call uh any minute look um im sorry i wasnt there for you today dont worry about it you know what gretchen did for sucre made me realize we could use her i asked for the sixth key whatd she say shes on it you all right all right were about to go to the airfield were gonna ship brads body off to his mother got his things here where is he over here his mother will appreciate that mrs bellick this is fernando sucre great job today im sorry to hear about your friend but thats um admirable work volunteering with a bunch of criminals like that were all the same really heres the application you requested for the desk girl you have a good night cole you too thanks hello hello okay we will thank you as weve all learned the hard way theres an electronic alarm barrier around the perimeter of the foundation unfortunately that is scyllas most primitive line of defense the wall itself is fortified with steel fiber the good news is on the inside here there are no cameras the company doesnt want any visual evidence that scylla exists the bad news is that there are both weight and microphonic sensors here and here that will alert company security to the presence of any breathing human being that weighs more than two pounds as far as i can tell the first challenge is getting around that wall and then we can worry about crossing the floor without touching it in silence its complicated but uh im already working on something brad didnt die in vain we can make this work that was the neurologist you have a hypothalamus hamaratoma its really rare you were probably born with it um things have changed its been growing which is why youve been experiencing your symptoms and the doctor feels that you need surgery two days thats uh thats what i need no tomorrow otherwise you could die and theres no alternative wwwtvsubtitlesnet    when  i messed up  what do you mean  so youre feng  susan  the wall itself is  the bad news is that  and microphonic sensors that will alert  to the presence of any  that weighs more  you have a  and the doctor feels   two days  otherwise you could die  just a little  go slow no theres no way he  sing it sister after what he  i can hardly  look what we  make sure that cosmic  for once we obtain the  there aint hardly  in between us   million i was born on  just keep both  lets go thats great thank you so  yeah he can see   no  we need to finish  we can  i need one  michael dr malden  hes given  he wont alert  if you put this off  youre going to be  do you want to  that theyre not going  theres still  all right three oclock last time i drilled  it was with an eggbeater back  i just cant believe its  and hes  hell be  how do  i dont im just trying to  hes sick but i guarantee  thatll make  going back  if we dont get in there  hes going  im scared too but a hospitals the best  he wont go without a  well alex and fernando  with the video right should be yeah so then all we need  gretchens working on that you really think  with the card absolutely anything else nope eight guards will accompany  up to the garage where an  one truck is not going  that is why i have a full  to march air  there it will be  we need air support all  colonel rififi is lending  it may be hard  but i do

goes south then i do have a backup plan sucre i want you to go with sara to the meeting place and get a lookout alex and i are gonna make sure they dont bring any surprises by doubling back to the warehouse and then following them to the rendezvous this is where were meeting the senator all right well be there you know my father spent most of his political life chasing justice it was sort of an obsession and my mother and i could never understand why he would so easily make other peoples problems his own and i think its why she left him and michael you remind me more and more of him these days the way you put everybody elses problems before your own that said i want you to know that if this meeting with senator dallow doesnt go the way you want it to you dont have to worry about you and me nothings nothings gonna come between us yeah and everything is gonna be okay right you know ive figured it out dhs wined and dined you in the beginning and promised you the world and then they ultimately settled on a broom closet next to some schmuck from the faa and you said nil gretchen you have a real keen sense of perception its amazing and this all ends with a threestory hut in tahiti right flatscreen tv a couple jet skis outside but what youre gonna find don is that when the rush is over and youre done patting yourself on the back and theres no one left to tell the story to youll be just as alone as you are now thats who don self is is that right you tell me yeah take out your gun whats going on you want a cut or not bagwell take out your gun relax don all right point it at

what he has to do and we have to do our part right now thats getting on that bus and getting out of the city and we got to go now he just wants you both to be safe we got to go we really got to go

wants yeah right okay but if the deal with dallow is legit theres no reason to run right michaels just covering the bases making sure that we dont run into trouble again yes but if hes in trouble hes going to need our help well maybe he thinks theres nothing left for us to do if we leave now were leaving him behind i didnt know don self had it in him now that we know hes behind this our situations a lot worse were not talking about our careers anymore were talking about real jail time we get  years just for conducting an unauthorized operation without congressional approval or not this doesnt have to be about containment anymore it could be about excision you all right with that senator then they all go where are the others mahone sucre tancredi theyre not coming linc and i will testify but the others well we all get immunity those are the terms our testimony alone will put self away gentleman we cant have the others running around while were trying to wrap this up can we call em can

and bagwells staying here i warned you not to screw me over its been a long time gretchen whos he im the guy thats holding scylla its incomplete theres a piece missing slick i believe you have something that belongs to me come and get it just so its fresh in your mind this isnt a magic elixir you still need a hospital you need real equipment could probably use a doctor whos still got a license to practice medicine first we get scylla then ill go to the hospital you finished just about so i take it youre ready to talk now actually im ready to meet i got a better idea everyone out youre surrounded come out with your piece of scylla michael you first come out or im going to gas you out if its the latter i have a full magazine with  rounds want to bet at least one of them could outrun you what makes you think id even keep the piece on me oh i know you michael youre not letting that thing out of your sight i stand by my original offer come and get it okay stay low let the gas rise to the ceiling this is a big space but it wont take many more of those before we start to asphyxiate wheres lincoln here we go michael √º√†√∂√§ √≥√™√≥ √ß√´¬µ√ß√¢¬Ω wwwyyetsnet all right now we take a ride and we pick up scylla or i put a bullet in your head it aint gonna happen try me good morning okay all right now that we all have guns pointed at us lets talk okay fine you could start by telling me who im talking to don youre talking to a guy who spent  years in service of his government all by the book you know what the sum total of it was nothing nada but were very similar michael and fundamentally we want the same thing and i have a way to get it hows that i got a buyer for scylla a guy who wants to destroy the company as much as you do and hes willing to pay a lot of money for it how much nine figures in an offshore account of your choosing so there it is or you could stand by your principles ill pass look i burned you right and id apologize but whats the point were all out in the cold now but were not going to be able to hide from the company on a shoestring budget whos the buyer hes an excompany guy with a bone to pick just like your father michael id need to meet him first that can be arranged and just so you know this this wasnt personal this is just business well be in touch we stick to the plan all right were going to get scylla we wait for alex to come through on his end all right wheeler hello alex you came i always do to the detriment of my pay grade these last few weeks ive been part of an offthebooks operation under the hand of homeland security felicia the people im working with were this close to coming up with the one thing that can destroy the company their little black book we can get it names numbers look i dont want to get caught up in some interagency politics so if this is homelands show homeland buried the operation we cant come back in but we could still take the company down so my question to you is who do you know in the bureau that you can trust it used to be you alex ive lost a lot of things these last few months not the least of which is your trust but i dont come to you hat in hand scylla is real but if you dont want anything to do with it its okay its all right i could walk away yeah there is someone who might be able to help ferguson sir there are over ten million faces in los angeles even with nsa and cia satellite links were going to be sifting through millions of gigabytes of image data the chances of finding don self scofield and burrows its not good well lets improve the odds self and the brothers may have stolen scylla but none of them have the connections to offload it add gretchens face to the search she wont be welcome in scofields camp so connect her image with selfs we find those two within five feet of each other anywhere in los angeles and weve found scylla are you friends with my auntie gretchen go play in your room mommy will be in soon wheres her daddy gretchen doesnt talk about him so emily doesnt know that you aint that gretchens her mama no and id like to keep it that way cute girl dont hurt my little girl if you have to do something do it to me what do you think i am a monster youre holding us prisoner in our own home im just as much a prisoner as you eggshell white bold lettering double embossed i was cole pfeiffer respected businessman top salesman in the northeast region now im back being prisoner of my own identity theodore bagwell convict to hell with it we are who we are right what were you selling never you mind you just pray your sister comes through the company gets destroyed  and we get paid its a great deal this guy is just another general krantz waiting to happen lets say we do sell it to him and the company burns you know what happens then another company is built right on top of that one were not selling sucre pulled it off great is this going to work its like an ultrasound it can see through everything youre building up a tolerance then well up the dosage yeah i have and at this point a higher dosage would have more side effects than the tumor itself ill manage without it sit this one out let me and sucre handle it im going why cant he understand i need to finish this everything that happened it all started with the company maybe not for lincoln maybe for him this all started with his little brother breaking him out of prison michael you saved his life if anything happens to you he spends the rest of his life feeling guilty for that tell me something at what point does a noble deed become fanaticism fanaticism is the only way to beat them even if it kills you hey pop the trunk micheal sucre just sent a text hes found gretchen and self good good you all right yeah for now all right linc  yeah after your trial that day i came to see you at fox river what about it i thought you did it i thought you killed terrence steadman along with everyone else but by the time i left i i knew you were innocent and i had to get you out of that place so however this plays out i have no regrets scofields hiding something in the washroom i think we just found our missing piece of scylla call vikan i

save yourself a lot of pain and the embarrassment of begging me to stop if you just tell me where they are gretchen and agent turncoat yeah information like that seems like it could be of a certain intrinsic value if there were offers made carrots dangled i could see look i deserve some kind of something here all the work i put in if it wasnt for me finding whistlers bird book then the only thing you deserve is the opportunity to keep your teeth and fingernails no you im not gonna tell you anything im gonna pull out every single tooth every single one how about it look i was just fooling

whole thing gretchen i can handle my business oh yeah why dont you start by handling that river of nerves thats running down your forehead did you think this would be easier i hoped but i guess i always knew it was going to come down to a pile of bodies i never pegged you for a killer yeah well i never pegged you for a mom is there anything that youd like to peg me for don oh stop okay dont embarrass yourself that may work on everyone else but right now the only thing im thinking about is that  million so close up your blouse and open your eyes because the buyers on the way and i dont

gonna do you want me to go in the back seat right here i want you to have a little bit of respect for my intelligence alex i do which is why i know you wouldnt violate code b which states that an individual being transported by a representative of the criminal justice system must be afforded the opportunity to relieve himself if the duration of the transport is more than three hours and i do believe were creeping up on that time all right ill see what i can do but im going to remind you of a code the one that says if a prisoner attempts escape during transfer the accompanying agent has the right to shoot them through the back of the head you sure you dont want to hold it alex oh yeah im sure any pain or discomfort mr scofield no those needles theyre for stabilization not exactly throughout the surgery different portions of michaels cerebral cortex will be stimulated triggering the areas that control senses like hearing smell memory thats why some people right before death often speak of their life flashing before their eyes exactly when oxygen is cut off to the brain it kicks into overdrive tapping into every resource to continue operating the body as a result all of the senses fire off at once everything youve ever known felt believed it all passes in a blink of an eye √¨√Ω√≤√´ charles i guess you can probably call me db now the answer is no the answer youre wondering if youre dead the answer is no then why am i here i   lieve thats a question we all need to find the answer to this is officially now the most secure bathroom break in the history of law

these they know were onto them we got to find these people before they split someones here but its not the seller what do you want me to do im just curious lang when did you decide to turn your back on me probably about the same time you decided to become a fugitive i wasnt talking to you i took an oath to uphold the law alex did you do it for a promotion did they promise you anything to serve me up the only thing i ever wanted was your safety alex the longer youre on the run the lower my chance of getting what i want what you looking for out there alex there agent wheeler ive got a suspect fleeing custody off route  about three miles north of greenburg requesting backup and air support i didnt mean to startle you what are you doing here customer service quality control i like to keep a hand in all our theaters of engagement spoken like a military man so easy to discuss lives in the balance when its just theater i admire your devotion sara its an attribute i value above all others but i wonder is it the cause you believe in or the man i mean are you an ideologue or just a silly schoolgirl following the brooding boy who finally noticed her im the girl whose father was murdered whos looking for the bastard responsible would you like me to make a few phone calls see if i can point you in the right direction you can relax hes receiving the best possible care is he because ive never seen this equipment before and ive never seen this procedure its experimental isnt it well you could say that but it has been used once before how long did the patient live dr tancredi i know your opinion of the work we do here but know this not everything is as it seems and for what its worth the patient lived a long happy life westmoreland what are you doing it is the job of a structural engineer to make sure everything he creates is designed to withstand the weight placed upon it what ive built here does not hold up if you discovered that a structure you built was deficient would you tear down the building or find a way to fix it ive tried to fix it ive tried to make things right all ive done is add more weight to it and now now i cant take anymore all i wanted to do was save my brothers life did you do that yes but how many other people lost their lives in the process knowing that now would you have let him die no and that makes you feel like some kind of murderer perhaps take ten lives youre a serial killer take thousands youre a war hero this isnt war are you sure theres nothing more than the companys little black book names numbers operation reports not everything is as it seems michael but you know that dont you all right look we need to reestablish contact with the buyer explain to him what happened and then set a new location for the exchange i got to say im amazed at you don yeah all this time and you never once asked to see the information in scylla thats cause i dont care about the information i just care what its worth maybe youre just worried if you actually knew what was on it youd have second thoughts about who youre selling it to hello female voice mr burrows we have a hit on the targets traffic camera picked them up entering a convenience store on valley and th looks like they left a footprint   dont move thats a hell of a job agent lang youre the one who taught me how to read the mind of a convict on the run remember if you take me in

walking away with the information thats on scylla will do whatever it takes to stay below the company radar besides would you screw some guys wife and then leave your card on his pillow isnt that what you just did to the general come on after all weve been through we cant be honest with each other your little photo shoot and your weak ass attempt at the sixth card you wanted him to know you were involved right come on he punished you treated you like crap just like your real daddy you want at least one of them to pay for it right come on gretchen ii know you i did my homework gee don you you just cracked my whole electra complex wide open kudos but youre not the only one who did their homework just so you know yeah you got something to say right now we need to be ready for whatevers coming you better watch your six don okay you wanted to see me yeah ii cant quite tell from the monitors but from what i can see thethe grow it looks like it isnt just on the hypothalamus i understand that was the initial diagnosis but once we got in there it appears to have spread to the hippocampus as well okay um so with the removal will there be any memory loss well in cases like this where small portions have to be removed it hardly ever affects whats referred to as net memory were all tapped into such small portions of what weve experienced in our lifetime the bulk of its just kept in storage rarely acknowledged by the conscious mind so while there may be some gross memory loss he wont ever know its gone because hell never know it was there nurse bps dropping  whats going on i dont know increase dopamine delivery rate to  general well use the bargain when the time is right the time is now bargain bargain well use time  time is right well use the bargain when the time is right perhaps the time is now doctor eegs spiking brain activitys all over the place maps at  bps erratic dropping   surgeon give him one mil of atropine michael are you still with us the best minds in the world  designed this system and you almost beat it general  but as long as we have we have as long as we so what are you hearing uh scyllas worth me im hearing millions we have scylla things have

charles michael michael dont leave me dont you dare leave me sara company tracked the serial code off the receipt gretchen just placed a call five minutes ago matching the tracking number from where two miles away i was told thered be three of you well there arent you have the money because thats a small case for  million we dont deal in cash once i verify the validity of the item the funds will be wired to an account number you provide the item please no no no youre not gonna see the item until i see the money okay youll have to forgive me if i dont trust a shiny case with some buttons i need to confirm that the data is intact without it the item you possess is nothing more than a fancy box speaking of give this man the item no im not giving anyone this is a businessman making a business transaction one with the longer you take the more danger you put us all in can you read whats on there you better hope so theyre not just gonna give us scylla you know what that means right okay lets split up im sure you understand no one can know where scyllas going to its your lucky day sugar not yours drop it cover her where is he i dont know where is he i dont know gretchen gone stolen by who by who if i die youll never know you look beautiful youre a liar howd it go theyre still running some tests but they feel pretty confident they got it all and what is this place you need to know something about your surgery it was performed by company doctors and the general made all the arrangements why i dont know lincolns handling it he says he has a plan ill be honest right now youre alive and thats all i care about youre gonna laugh but i had a dream about scylla the only thing we really know about it is what self told us you need to rest im serious what if its not just the companys little black book what if its not everything is as it seems something more like what something good why go to so much trouble to protect information about the past information the company could just delete any time they wanted to the general said general as long as we have scylla we have power i dont think he was talking about power like control or influence i think he was talking about energy boron argon gallium indium bargain theres a theory that if you can find a way to combine these elements into the design of a solar cell you can harness  of the suns energy with that kind of power possibilities are limitless it would certainly explain all the security around scylla theyre not protecting the past theyre protecting the future wow wonder what else is on it i mean the equipment you were treated with and the drugs they gave you none of it exists on the open market which would explain why some people are willing to pay hundreds of millions to get their hands on scylla its not about taking down the company its about becoming the company its about knowing what they know controlling what they know what do we do now so whats the next move im gonna check on michael no i mean after that i mean scyllas out there somewhere are we really gonna keep chasing it i dont know well figure it out later no i wont be here linc i cant do it anymore sara said mike was okay and thats all i needed to know but now i got to go live my life and thats a life where i can go a day without seeing a dead body oror almost becoming one im not running away papi imim just im just moving on this was never about you everything you did you did for us ill never forget that i know you got something cooking so whatever it is just be careful okay yeah thank you hey and when you

threats you and lincoln might be kidnapped you were in imminent danger really where was she when my brother was strapped to an electric chair shed been working in a madagascar rain forest without satellite access or she wasnt alive hasnt been for  years and this is all fiction theres a million acres corn and soy outside cordoba that was arid scrub before your mothers research thats not fiction

rehabilitation kind but hes receiving excellent care theres nothing for you to worry about whatever it is you have planned for him i would simply like to help maintain his health and thats appreciated but its impossible believe me you serve michael best at a distance right now trust me i have no agenda apart from simply wanting to see that hes okay and in three days to a week hell be back in your loving arms forever okay im not that patient indulge yourself sit by the pool envision the future financial security michaels talents being utilized on a global scale you beside him innovating michaels talents being utilized on a global scale im simply trying to maximize his potential yours too whats being done to him im putting an end to this exhausting catandmouse thank you for stopping by radical architecture is a rejection of all formal and moral parameters from your thesis someone elses words heavily paraphrased and it pertains to buildings structures i think you meant it as a metaphor what that the ends justify the means which neatly coincides with your mothers philosophy did you know that she had an almost identical quote in her thesis from  years ago youve done a lot of homework just a few conversations let me guess you two had some kind of moment at the company christmas party ive known your mother for years well enough to know youve got the same brilliant mind and the same sense of humor for that matter im guessing this isnt about my sense of humor she was just as resistant to joining the company but then she learned the truth if the truth is that the company is all about saving the world i dont buy it and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the company what do you want with me a fully functioning scylla project would exist on a global scale it cant be managed by one person but two equally formidable working in lockstep absolutely thats very good youve clearly thought of everything michael if i werent telling you the truth how would i have gotten this this is just a stupid girl who dates a criminal this is  a waste of time a signature of burrows leadership all right we need to make a shift bagwell im telling you right now if i make my play and you go soft i will sail you off that loft balcony and no one will bat an eye my aim is true don keep it in your pants ill keep it in my pants all right all right all in favor of changing the regime say aye aye aye captain aye all right burrows is out good great send it the companys emailing tias credit card history you know im thinking more and more that this is an inside job why  a couple reasons the hardware he brought to the meet he could read scylla right on the spot since hes disappeared i should be able to find this man and i cant people you cant find are usually company how does that change anything it doesnt it just makes everything harder lincoln when are we going to get this out of the way what of all the mercenary humps ive thrown at guys in my lifetime i think im due for one i want dont flatter yourself too late name it and i do mean anything a big ol fat load of nothin a big ol goose egg nothing old address books photographs hard drive from her computer i checked her emails and her web sites theres nothing from our guy are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here because this is starting to feel like a wasted trip how long is it gonna take the company to pull everything off this thing a couple hours all right linc this is the deal look we appreciate your effort but bagwell and i took a vote and this being florida and all you came up a little bit short meaning youre not in charge who is him yeah the bullinthechina shop routine might have worked when you were stealing gumballs but our asses are on the line now okay and we all have deals with the general so thats the way its gonna be and if you notice even gretchen hasnt leapt to your defense linc just let him wear his crown i would if i thought he wasnt gonna sell this thing oh what am i the only one whos thought about that look heres the deal linc at some point youll have a vote but until then youre done all right were shuttin you down okay youre no longer in charge uhoh looks like theres been a recount bad time no perfect the second you stop doing what i tell you to do im gonna blow your brains out bring her back its not gonna be the same stir any memories i was ten we were on a camping trip in jackson hole fishing hiking family huddled under a blanket in front of the bonfire you can stop now why because two years later it was gone you know three of the four people in this photograph are still alive so what are you suggesting grab my fishing pole time for aa family reunion in wyoming or wherever you like dont tell me its something you havent wished for i wished for a lot of unrealistic things i got over them too why when we can make this happen these pictures could have been taken anywhere at any time before you were incarcerated youd go to visit her grave on the anniversary all right enough youd bring a bouquet of blue irises youd sit for an hour i said stop it when youd leave youd take a flower and pin it to your lapel she watched you do this every year shes seen the pain you carry she wants to make amends all right so you did a little digging good for you but everything out of your mouth is a lie and i dont believe a word of it so lets just stop lets just stop thats tias address right there pull it up all right she lives here works here but yesterday she used her credit card to buy a drink at the pelican club a little after noon and then she picked up something at the gift shop a little after  waiting for her boyfriend to debark disembark hes already in town yeah then he lives in the marina or this is another reason to think its an inside job if hes working with someone from the company they wouldnt want their names on any flight manifests all right theyre trying to get scylla out of the country by boat undetected lets go alex yeah thanks for coming when you did man you helped me like you said you would i owe you okay ill do the talking you guys wait here alex lets go afternoon hows it going what can i do you for recognize her

our department is working with the office of foreign assets control have you heard of them yep bet you have were looking into smuggling and contraband transportation of cuban cigars none here swear to god all right well thats for us to decide its going to take about a week and its going to involve shutting down this entire marina oh yeah for about a week or she was here with that guy you were talking about he wanted to know which berth a private charter was docking in he asked me to move it further down the dock which i did further away from the coast guard slip i didnt ask and i didnt accept any money if he said he paid me hes lying whats the point of departure nassau bahamas round trip when does it arrive arrived hey everybody okay my name is don self homeland security my colleagues and i are hoping that you guys have a wonderful and safe trip unfortunately were going to have to do a quick luggage check search shouldnt take more than a minute folks your cooperation is

pal just like old times bring her back you know i cant do that but look theres some stuff that i can do its not going to be the same but were going to figure it out and no matter what its still going to be me and you i am thrilled that youre enjoying your trip to the mountains but its not an openended vacation scofields exhausted despondent hes very resistant but a classic abandoned child hell come around time frame doctor unaided three days with the pentothal sooner but its nearly a chemical lobotomy but if he turns on his own itll be his decision his reasoning well own him forever scofields squirrelly i wont trust him till he walks hot coals i think i can get him there good but if i find out hes been playing you doctor youll get the same lobotomy as scofield just get it done lets go in the van go if you fight when those cuffs are off the guards will stomp the life out of you yeah forgive the dramatics the company cant know im talking to you you are the company youre his daughter do you want to find michael scofield of course i do its  miles northeast of downtown id move quickly what are they doing to him having lemonade theyre carving out his personality thats how they recruit or youre setting me up clandestine warfare isnt pretty but the rules of engagement dont include killing and torturing the innocent at least not for me michael is the object of a quick and nasty process and youre wasting time out out we need the footage from that security camera not to offend either of you but i took the liberty of calling my attorney to find out exactly what the scope of your authority is here  and he tells me  just get the tape all right sure either we missed scylla no no no we did not miss scylla we searched every bag then maybe the buyer was already on the boat and was disembarking right i mean if they dont want their names on any flight manifest maybe they just eased back on in that wouldnt be the worst news that means theyre in miami right so get yourself back down with your disgraced badge to steamboat willie and have him cough up every name of every person on that boat coming off okay thats good because they probably would have traveled in on a lowgrade charter from the bahamas and used their real names right that would be a good plan how is he hes alive so we get scylla then were free all of us pam lj all of a sudden the company grew a heart theyre just tired of us they want scylla back thats it then we never really had anything they wanted exactly now we got leverage we dont have it yet anything no nothing yet nothing no lincoln you dont understand the way she said recruit made my stomach turn theyre going to torture him he can take care of himself at least for one day until we get scylla lincoln he needs to be in the icu whats your plan break him out i dont know i dont have one well youre putting him and us at risk just stay in the hotel until we get back to la all right tancredi got the location of her shining knight she may be heading there now exemplary bagwell thank you sir a deals a deal right not to be a broken record but all i ask but i think were making some real progress general the scofieldburrows family would have been a formidable asset to the company but since his lapdog insists on complicating matters we move on general we can handle a lone female if indeed thats what were dealing with but its my experience that with the one comes many do it now doctor i need an hour he just ate i dont want him to aspirate now doctor i want scofield pliable for transit your vehicle arrives in  minutes and if we cant revive him cest la vie michael come out we need to talk think of something thats it thats our guy theres tia right beside him weve got to pull that image get it to the company and have them match it wheres gretchen howd you find me once i found your mug shot it really wasnt that hard getting your legit cell number well now im here what do you want you never bothered to ask back in los angeles you were too busy planning on killing me but i actually worked for the company i know who you are and ill ask it again what do you want to solve your problems scott i mean it is what gets me up out of bed in the morning you have a big problem and so does whoever it is youre working for and you obviously know that or you wouldnt have graced me with your presence and you can make that problem disappear quickly and completely with an extra added bonus crucial i might add i then feed the company a story that has them looking elsewhere meaning youre invaluable and please dont kill you yeah without the please how much a lot and its about to double here in a second if you dont look at me when im talking to you you go run and talk it over with your boss call me with a number im

are we killing the kid the kid doesnt even know its her mother come on linc pull the trigger do it her names emily shes only eight years old come on do it were not them you keep your mouth shut and you get to see your kid in visitation i know what the general will do to me for talking believe me i know him well are you serious lets go lets go what happened you havent said a word i think my mothers alive thats his cell phone answer it hello hello your boys dead and now im coming after you did you hear me whoever you are im coming after you who was that it was my son lincoln wwwtvsubtitlesnet  your mother works for us your mother is alive you know im thinking more and more that this is an inside job why the hardware he brought to the meet he could read scylla right on the spot hands on your head weve got to get out of here michael get in sorry but right now i want my life back more than i want your money wheres scylla lets talk about that okay where is it i can get it

dont know just found them on the doorstep son of a they lay one hand on my mama i swear on my life shes in a state home i thought we were working with these people so did i im gonna make a call find out whats going on mr burrows we had a deal our deal is contingent upon the retrieval of scylla based on the mediocrity of your performance on that front thus far i thought it best to make sure youre all properly motivated just tell me how your team is progressing i swear to god man when i when i get a hold of you if i were you id be doing everything in my power to demonstrate my competence right now we killed the guy who came to miami we found some keys on him were looking into them are we done not quite a new competitor has joined the search were the ones getting scylla well thats good to hear because the competing party is your brother michael michaels with you michaels getting treatment with you apparently michaels a little more headstrong than either of us imagined but dont worry we have a lead on him somewhere in central arizona mr oren is waiting in his limousine if you speak to michael tell him to find a very good hiding place because if any of my men spot him theyve been given a green light  miles to go if we take turns sleeping we can be there by tomorrow night should we call lincoln let him know were coming michael he took the companys deal to save your life and for what its worth i mightve done the same thing then youd be wrong too you know this promises to be a really really long ride so how about we just call truce all right forgot napkins get down come on he comes anywhere near my kid you know don you seem to be taking this whole thing pretty well yeah well im a pretty calm guy all im saying is my mama his son his wife we dont even know who they got on you thats cause its none of your business all right all you need to worry about is that im here to do a job holdsecure the company that manufactures the keys its called holdsecure listen to this each key they produce is implanted with a computer chip that chip sends out a unique electronic signal that opens its lock something that hightech im telling you im betting they got a database thatll tell us exactly where each keys corresponding lock has been installed look at that these keys run about  bucks each you only spend that kind of money if youre protecting something of vital importance like scylla someone just tried to access carruths account at holdsecure and what information was compromised we dont know yet and who was trying to access it we dont know thank you for bringing that to my attention good work yes its your son we already have safeguards in place to deal with lincoln im talking about michael hes escaped company custody hes coming to miami right now christina if only they understood what it is im trying to do thank you very much thanks okay what now well think of something michael we cant afford to buy a car and we cant fly its time to call your brother got it weve got the locations of those two locks ones in little havana the other ones down by the water perfect lincoln why dont you and i you take self and go to little havana were gonna head south huh thats a surprise we need suntan lotion be right there its me whats your problem look i need you to hear me out on this linc everything was all set up and you blew it you couldnt just let me handle this could you if by handle you mean give scylla back to the general then no i couldnt its more complicated than that actually its not listen to me i want my life back and this is the only way we can do that i dont believe thats true you know what man you need to grow up look if thats how you really feel linc i should warn you im going to do everything in my power to stop you i had a deal with the general you blew it he finds you hes gonna kill you surprise surprise i did this for us michael you me sara lj so you could be with sara two seconds just think of your family feels like familys the only thing i can think about these days what does that mean michael linc mom is alive what guess ill see you in miami we gotta get out of here sir you mind if i ask where youre going dallas mind if we hitch a ride i got  bucks gas money please sir cabs not big enough for the two of you if you want to ride together youre going to have to ride back here done get comfortable gonna be eight hours till we stop again linc if scylla really is in there theres gonna be security i need you focused yeah all clear upstairs you find something picture of my mom someone must have known i was coming someone whos connected enough to be working with carruth and who knows you well enough to get their hands on that picture theres only one person i can think of that fits that description youre saying my moms in miami if she was operating out of this house she certainly had access to money shes a company agent gretchen said she thought that this could be an inside job linc your mother could have scylla she used to bake cookies when wed come home from school play kickball with us in the backyard theres just no way that woman was a company agent you did read her file didnt you i saw medical reports that said she had the same diagnosis i did and that company doctors operated on her too now im wondering if they took her off to a log cabin in the woods after they were done introduced her to a friendly shrink how else could someone just stand by and watch their own children were hunted down like dogs maybe she didnt know she knew maybe it was over her head or maybe she didnt care anyway im just surprised the general waited so long to drop this bomb on us actually i think that part makes sense i mean for whatever reason your mother didnt want you to know she was alive or you would have known years ago the general was just keeping that secret right keeping her happy keeping her working but now the game has changed yeah now he thinks you might be useful just like mom beyond question he possesses the most gifted mind of any man ive ever encountered well ill try not to take that too personally he drilled into your office safe and copied your card without you even noticing as i recall you were sitting right next to me if we could have turned michael scofield it would have been like having  more years of christina pull over thats my ride whats going on goodbye jonathan this isnt the place i could pick that lock with my stump no nno nno remember what they say about books and their covers when harry winston donated the hope diamond to the smithsonian you know how he got it from new york to dc registered mail its the safest way to go after all who is going to be looking for the hope diamond at the post office right and who would be looking for scylla at some rundown storefront church in little havana they got scylla back there somewhere you walk in there reeking that cop stink you wont last a second thats a good point thats why youre going in may i help you yes as a matter of fact im charles patoshik im a professor of anthropology at southern florida university im doing some various research on various different kinds of uh uh uh caribbean religions and uh perhaps you could start back there where you you do your uh services that is our sanctuary only the pure of soul may venture inside i know ii have been in many such rooms let me see your hand your soul is black stained with the blood of the innocent i cannot let you pass i have never been so offended in my life i suggest that you continue your research elsewhere if you drop something by accident you leave a fingerprint on it she wanted you to find this why you ever seen it before no do you remember anything about that day i was four years old any idea where it was taken no you okay i mean if i found out my mom was listen as far as im concerned shes not my mom shes just someone in the way of my freedom all right so on my sixth birthday um my father was long gone by then so it was just me mom and linc and mom hands me my present my uh my only present and i just know i just know its the millennium falcon with the battle alert sound exactly i totally owned that of course you did anyway i had been asking for this thing for weeks and the package is just the right size and i rip open the wrapping paper and its a birdhouse oh no oh yeah except its not even a birdhouse its actually a birdhouse kit im so sorry i didnt talk to her for two days after that but when she finally got me to open the thing we sat there together put it together piece by piece and it was the first thing i ever built and i loved it and she knew i would she knew me better than i knew myself thats what moms do yeah but the strange thing is even though i havent seen her for  years theres this part of me that feels like maybe she still does your truck looks a little low to the ground you mind stepping outside i just got weighed  miles back you highway patrol where are you going youve got no business in there unless you show me a warrant you get the hell out of there right now thank you goodness i got my weigh station ticket right here on the dash as soon as you see that youll see i got it right here here you go i need you to follow me back to phoenix are you crazy i got to get this load to dallas well thats your choice i got em i think we need to call your brother no signal we must be in the middle of nowhere lincoln said that if the company caught you i think i saw a side door back here what about the main door youll never get that open im sure its latched from the outside can you open the side door maybe sara help me out i dont think were going to be able to move this maybe we wont have to i have troubling news about general krantz hes alive i dont see how thats possible yes well what im hearing is a helicopter with from company headquarters in los angeles one hour ago it landed for two minutes in canyon country and now its back in los angeles so you got the corpse the helicopter landed back at company headquarters you know how important getting rid of him is to what were trying to accomplish all right i can still get this done not in our time frame all right im pulling the plug we need to start dealing with the consequences wait wait wait first things first he knows that ive betrayed him i need to disappear i think thats a good instinct i have a house in sun valley i have another idea do you mind putting me on speaker you know griff youre a brave man and i thank you for everything youve done its been an honor now now what the car in this picture has florida plates did you ever vacation there  no   do you know anyone  from forida who came up to visit   no why did they take this picture in front of that car we didnt its been doctored im not sure about that i mean the lighting the shadows all sync up perfectly this is a  zephyr michael was born in  youre the only one who couldve picked up on that she doctored that for you lets see what else she mightve changed whats the license plate on that zephyr mik  martin luther king boulevard intersects with route  about five miles north of here good you guys are here listen were a little outmanned down in little havana we could use some backup we got a lead on the buyer great what are we waiting for i think i gonna do it myself come on lets stay together were a team right  i said i got it   after our little special deliveries this morning each one of us has an equal stake whoever started this were all going to take them out the buyer we think its lincolns mother what like i said im doing this myself linc if she has scylla shes not just going to hand it over any more than the general would have you dont know that we always thought whoever had scylla would do what the general did maybe she wont are you serious your mother is a company agent she was she might be one of the good guys now with all due respect i dont think youre in a place where you can make a clear determination about that listen this mlk  could be nothing but at the church there could be scylla if i need you ill call this should work christina you need to acknowledge that our chance of success has substantially declined in the last  hours there are people out looking for us we need to start thinking in terms of contingencies just a little while longer only a few more days general krantz refused to adjust when there were credible threats against him thats the reason we have scylla now are you honestly comparing me to him i understand what you think your role is in all of this and i appreciate your efforts but if you cant tell the difference between he and i perhaps you need to ask the general for your old job back oh look here he is would you like to take the call jonathan good afternoon christina its good to hear your voice i assume this means youve retrieved scylla not yet oh troubling news have any idea where it is where are you christina johannesburg where else would i be ive had some of my contacts in your area check on your house theres no one home well of course not as long as scyllas in play that address is blown where are you christina i dont like your tone jonathan excuse me if i sound a bit abrasive but its been a while since anyones tried to kill me oh my god are you all right what happened oren oren we found his body executed i can only assume that hes working with someone someone who doesnt tolerate failure now where are you christina you listen to me if youre implying that i had anything to do with this where are you after everything ive given to the compeny my husband my children i think its time that we had a sitdown  and talk   tell you what why dont you gether up the brain trust that halfwitted daughter and your psychotic mistress why dont you get together and figure out where scylla is then call me mr burrows may i escort you to your table you havent changed a bit im glad you got my message i know it wasnt the most straightforward mode of communication but i had to be sure it was you at least now i know where michael gets it from im sure you have many questions wheres scylla its safe thats all i can tell you for right now then weve got nothing to talk about really thats the only reason you came here yeah i really wouldve thought you wanted to know the truth i know the truth you work for the company the same people that set me up for murder  lincoln   the same people that have been trying to kill me and michael ever since we escaped fox river you can think it as much as you want im not a monster  years and not even an apology if i thought an apology would do any good i would offer it please please sit down leaving you two boys was the hardest thing i ever did but you did and then you went off and worked for the company you know you think you know what the company is but you dont it is a body that bends to the will of its head and right now it is bloodthirsty and warhungry because thats who general krantz is but what if a woman a mother ran it can you imagine the different that would make you think youre a mother a mothers priority is her family if i give scylla back to the general he leaves me and michael alone and i get to spend time with my son in peace look i could sit here for days and try to explain to you why i did what i did suffice it to say i couldnt protect you then but let me protect you now what if general krantz were no longer in the picture once he is dealt with no one would come after you but i need time lincoln i need two days to put everything into place if you give me two days then i can give you and michael your complete and utter freedom all right all right im going to get started right away but if krantz suspects any of this hes going to hunt us both down and for that reason i cant risk being seen with you until all of this is over how will i get in touch with you you cant im sorry once we pull this box down itll push the water machine right through the side door were slowing down i think were getting off the highway im almost ready sara grab that strap over there all right hold it come on you all right after you clear the area i dont anticipate any problems all right scylla or not here we come all right hold on what the hell are those guys doing were not going against any additional people in there  we wait until they come back out   all right so lincolns mother is really the buyer it appears that way i hope he understands that if i need to take her out to get to scylla im not going to hesitate to kill her no question well lets just hope it doesnt come to that you serious yeah am i serious if we can get scylla without killing lincs mother thats the preferable outcome wait a second if im gonna be in the foxhole with you i need to know that you have my back mrs burrows has the item and the only way to get it is to kill her what is your move i pull the trigger there they go come on don self homeland security were investigating a cruelty to animal charge i have no idea what youre referring to were referring to ritual slaughters of chickens okay that might be allowed where you come from but here in america thats no mas chickens this is preposterous this is because im caribbean i swear to god i smelled chicken blood worse than the place down the street we shut down you want to turn this into something sit down if there arent any chickens there arent any chickens but were not going to know that until we take a look around the smell was coming from back there that is our sanctuary i cannot let you to disrupt it i understand your concerns but i need to go back there i insist you cannot do that best i can do is have you accompany us please please you come on lets go outside until theyre done lets go thats not a very heavenly thing to do find anything oh yeah what the hell are they up to i dont know he just asked to rent that closet did a woman ever come down here with him yeah once im telling you thats all i know drop it dont come here both of you on your knees i said on your knees i told you not to come in here wheres the other guy he ran lets go lets go are you all right yeah lets go come on were not going to make it back to the truck i know here take this ill be right back michael you all right yeah thanks the general should know by now not to mess with us the general didnt send me who did who sent you lincoln weve got news so do i were staying low for two days christinas promised to get rid of krantz i think shes lying i know it sounds crazy she said shes going to change the company in the way it operates so what the companys gonna go nonviolent now  just hear me out  im telling you i think shes lying its from the church some kind of credential there were some automatic weapons in there too and trust me if theres fake ids and weapons something bigs about to go down your mom she said after two days thats when she would make the change yeah take a look at the date on that laminate two days away  you think thats just a coincidence    come on lincoln you cant be surprised that a woman that would abandon her kids would be less than truthful about her intentions right now  hey where you going  i need to talk to her just take a moment lets figure this out if shes looking to head the company there has to a more realistic plan than a oneman frontal assault shell listen to me she asked you not to come back linc thats a warning lincolns back at the plaza i think we need to realize hes more of a threat than we gave him credit for he found the mansion his guys got the stash at the church hes not going to stop i told him to stay away sir alpha is a go christina we have a clean shot take it take it wwwtvsubtitlesnet  previously on prison break i had a deal with the general you couldnt just if by handle you mean then no i should warn you im in my power to stop you i want my life back linc mom is alive what i guess ill see you in miami if i give scylla he leaves me and i get to spend time what if general krantz were whats going on where are you christina i dont like your excuse me but its been a while the general should know by now not to mess with us the general didnt send me christina is going she said after two days she would make the change look at the date on that i need to talk to her lincolns back at the plaza i told him to stay away we have a clean shot take it roger that stevenson rooftop  oclock wheres christina wheres christina somebody call the police oh my god oh my god where is she where is she where is she we got his phone we got to go she only uses the place we should be fine sighing were you guys in college uh no shes got a practice in new york and she comes down here once a year god good for her nice family photos sand sun we could have that stuart take a seat

funny guy self on the snipers cell well need the company what if its your and we have to you got the gumption yeah lincoln i dont like having well dont who has scylla we dont know but we tangled whom youre interrogating hes dead lincoln is not to kill as many of them your methods make me question whether you are capable on a field of this size well get scylla i want answers today arent you leaving something a tad critical who has scylla hmm dont think too much lets talk about thinking are you stonewalling for the team here who popped you out if krantz didnt put all right theres my answer that christina has it he may or he may determine everybody were here to get scylla and the way to do that and to keep our mouths shut hey look at this yesterday he found near route  in arizona and ms are yeah but the rest of this ill do a search on rockwell assuming lincoln hasnt already hes been here three days and hes got access and once he puts his mind to something even if he figures well and from he doesnt think he is wrong so if im ms then whos vs nomaashkaar kaam no nomaashkaar kaam bengali has its a bitch lincoln got away have you ever seen a picture i have theyre quite beautiful theyre

not at the embassy any deal she makes will be right now with two things one is closing the deal which im assuming and the second is getting paid no sign of self how much can she get half a billion from india overseas account foreign wire transfer i doubt shes taking shes going to want confirmation that that money is before she leaves the us we find the money we find normally it takes for an international unless the bank is a federal reserve signatory the transfer is immediate you think shell head all she has to do is withdraw that that buyer has probably already shell know so lets find a federal reserve well have a shot and scylla there michael why i didnt put your name youre the only one here agents informants muscle finally theyre replaceable theres a branch about  minutes away that mind its one in a million nice to see it finally working i do not work for you not yet its legitimate i assure you oh okay i just want so i can be sure the luxembourg account well is she in there yeah

no you wanted to get heres your chance okay ill just count this out that wont all righty heres a printed record and i think a balance that high are you sure you dont want to talk to one no thank you everybody down now nobody gets hurt you down oh what are the odds dont the case ill take that hi mom scofield and burrows take scylla and go we gotta stay together i said go come on i think hes out move in move in after todays events how much egg does the us for exonerating lincoln burrow in the first place worth paula if you remember i was never in favor lincoln burrows is a thug for hire and his im amazed that the court system just such as they shouldve never let burrows they shouldve looked its clear that he had why would a brilliant structural maybe he needed it wasnt about the money what do you think to learn from all this this has been a huge judges will have to look in his life shh shh shh easy now doc easy its just your friendly now im gonna need get your hands off me you son of a not hands thanks to your boyfriend now as i was i just need all right all right hes taking too long somethings wrong we gotta go back for him he said hed catch up no somethings wrong call him

the opportunity to work something out you rejected me michael look lets meet now the time for talking passed about the time you put those ski masks on dont you think so heres what im going to do im going to shoot lincoln through the right rib cage just grazing the lower quadrant of his right lung it will slowly collapse making it very difficult if he doesnt get within five hours hell be dead christina mom please linc second hands spinning michael looks like you have scylla or someone you love subtitles by leapinlar wwwtvsubtitlesnet  previously on prison break when i sent you those envelopes i wasnt just playing games move on subject four my wife is a defenseless woman please dont do that dont call anyone you wanted to get in heres your chance threequarters in a numerical account all the data will be delivered case ill take that hi i know you have it bring me scylla or this time saras death linc looks like you have scylla or someone you love just think this i have and were how i will figure it out your brothers i wonder if we to bring linc and sara right now is that neither party knows that has leverage on you you bring them both together im not abandoning sara i didnt say to do that what i am saying of not having a bullet one at a time big surprise the dumb one got caught im beginning hes never gonna give it to you hmm i disagree he truly cares for you no matter youve shown you you know you two of nature versus nurture same environment same parents youre completely why do you think that is because moms a psychotic bitch hello michael all right you win ill give you scylla just give linc not until i get what i need edison shipping yard and bring my brother  minutes he doesnt just be there is is worth it sara do you ever go back and wonder how things if you had just left locked all the people whos lives hell your father would still be alive you ever think about that mmhmm and now that michaels it was all for nothing assuming he does return it if the situation were reversed and you were what would you do youd bring it back for the same reason because you couldnt let your heart betrays so does scofields you know youre probably right because if michael had used the night he stole scylla he would have killed you get her out of my sight take it either take my pocket understand the authorities looking for lincoln burrows the brothers famous for one of the most daring are considered homemade explosives you got a better idea maybe the best way to save everyone is give christina what im just trying to find a way dont end up on an autopsy table better get your story straight this whole time we should give scylla what you didnt hear self made his own bed  lets say that maybe somehow were able okay what then generals still got somebody watching my wife whats the plan what about lj whats the plan i cant think about maybe we go to your mother i mean theres no love lost with her contacts maybe she can find out were not giving up were gonna save everyone what the hell what am i doing here youre in recovery apparently you luckily someone found they did what the doctor will be in shortly no no no no tell the doctor im going actually i cant theres some men here waiting to what kind of men the kind with badges mr self my name this is agent wilson wright wed like to ask you about what lets start with where we and michael scofield be ready to pick us up better not get too close and you better not get too far all right if michael take out both knees i dont want him dead i just want him immobilized and what do you want once i get scylla yeah one of them guys i think i just seen him interesting choice i would have thought a little more public something a little isnt safe for me right now did you come alone did you come on we can have at least one actually id like that in spite of what you think i never wanted what did you want understanding forgiveness but when i made my choice any of those things but you will have power yes and youll have lincoln quite honestly i think youre getting speaking of which to a hospital so where is he where is scylla i need to know hes alive satisfied follow me now you wouldnt have some would you son im done playing games good then bring if i bring scylla out in the well then i guess the only thing is what i want isnt gasping and losing a pint of blood give it to me michael you know i cant do that give it to me michael youre running out i said no this is give it to me michael christina we gotta go come and get it go get it son of a come on come on michael we gotta go now now so the government after all weve been through you know how crazy well the proof every morning i wake up and shes healthy again man where are you living actually uh thats why you know uh we were in protective custody while i was waiting to testify but his case fell through anyway they wanted to not they wanted to put my ass so what are you doing here i was wondering if you uh had any idea wait wait whoa whoa look you in a bind and now you want to know come on come on no i am trying and them okay man dont you they are in a lot of trouble big time and the only way is if you help me find them were just trying behind this assassination well obviously your clearance for you to fully grasp the operation all right then how about we the dead body of your partner autopsy shows the bullet was fired from an agencyissued firearm the disappearance at homeland okay of dhs transportation officers with interesting information concerning a warehouse that you were conducting some so when an international is assassinated by two men taken into custody who by all appearances you tell us what were supposed whats going on is youre like im an accomplice that i had do you have how many years ive served do you have that ive served my as a homeland agent you are aware im sure an investigation has virtually no protection okay okay okay now where are michael scofield i dont know where they are okay but i could find out well michael clearly then he does about looks like youre not going to be an uncle what what sara hasnt told anybody christina banerjees he wants to know why he hasnt if michael doesnt call in the next ten minutes youre gonna wish hed let hello i thought we had an understanding i thought i made the stakes you did and im trying and im trying not but that would be a lot easier if i had something in this hand look every cop and fed the last thing i want to do by getting arrested and having the very thing you want well i appreciate you taking i do and believe me for

as one of those  agents because obviously i am not as honoured alex has been clean and sober and hes been completely associated with his involvement that doesnt include the shooting and burying his body that is just an allegation lets move on all those in favor of a special agent in the federal aye  all those oppose thank you its always a pleasure you know alex if youre able to just how committed you are now as you may know and is currently being housed we have concerns that michael scofield so this well obviously if scofield were pull off this plot the public embarassment will be so

lived so many lives i dont know who you are thatd be a consistent theme you were married to a what is that supposed to mean it means you should come to all things michael scofield or should i say kaniel outis you shouldnt drink bottled water the im touched by your concern have a seat good thank you you know sara you and i have a checkered past but i am evermore a mellowed by life trust me if you have something about michael id sure love to hear it okay when your call came in well lets just say that get our system kaniel outis actually cant stand it watching you drink out of that hey kishida could you bring sara a thank you kaniel outis is a known terrorist ties to isil wanted in the killing of a senior cia official  michaels no killer thats the problem because kaniel outis is thank you youre welcome and this is kaniel outis thats ridiculous the record here at state says  that thats kaniel outiss face but you and i both know no thats just a memory the official record history it says otherwise now now thats scary to think because only somebody very formidable would be capable of officially turning it would take a genius like michael youre insinuating that he did this he disappeared just quit on his life i want answers just like you do whos capable of this only a handful of people in the world sara sara i figure we got a day maybe two tops to get out of this hole at that point either the shelling gets us or isil does does any of this phase you at all the fact that were gonna die in here were not gonna die all of us hows that the roof  the roof aint happening we dont have time to come so you are nervous great now i know im in deep crap im only doing this for the money dont think you and i are suddenly good you just deliver me the sheik the sheiks are well away from here high desert and ive never heard of one being referred to as sheik of light which means its probably a code she knows your brother this tape its the only thing that doesnt belong your brother speaks in riddles  does he or uh morse or just numbers i think its a phone number voice mail mohammad eltunis director of electrical works in sanaa director of electrical works sheik of light _ thanks for taking the time to see us where is everybody they are fleeing ahead of the advance we have been trying to reach him all we know is that to try to find his daughter do you have an address for her we tried calling her but no answer address is here you are not going to god be with you then circled the address good luck youre coming with us if you think im going into the

well i am not getting myself killed pay up deliver the sheik then you get your money get in yes you should check your email sara what am i looking at footage captured by a one of those motion sensor takes intermittent photos of prey hunter comes out one this is the killing i the victims harlan gaines and the killer well you can see its who we call michael scofield  or kaniel outis or and then theres the blood kaniel or michael or whatever we all most nail him when he lands he gets away his luggage doesnt and gaines blood is all the evidence is overwhelming whatever name you want to call him michaels a murderer sara hey are you all right you all right oh this old thing yeah im doing fine whats going on i need your advice its probably something youre not gonna want to talk about i could really use its about michael still want to know how hugging naked with the guards got to be right what the hell is that we are the champions you get stuck in a portapotty i mean where are the girls riding the washing machines right look at my screen again you know the world you get stuck in a the biggest sob is a korean hes in withdrawal you know hes of queen paraphernalia in the world they say his house in seoul and he got in here how identity theft apparently he used to sit on his couch hack high net worth turned it into a collection and apparently freddy mercurys ashes wait you mean like his burntup body the story is freddys cremated to this day no one knows where they are ja admitted to me once when two million bucks hes got queens lead how exactly do you know all this i asked him hes a real mensch when i didnt know you talked to him amazing just when i think i you know my game whip see right there whip i dont even know why you call me that because youre my whip hand my ace in the hole yeah sure okay see in game theory be everyones friend till you make them love you so much their loyalty will make them act against their own best interests thats game theory a cold rational focus on winning even if its at everyone elses expense what im trying to understand leaving his family according to the little youve always an agenda right yeah i mean he apparently loved you of course he loved you how could he not but he also wanted you to open that door in the prison for him i mean true game theory everything everyone is a contingency you meet people you and you keep them you need to manipulate the im not judging you  i know schema as deep and as calculating as spin a man off into madness he might initially think in the service of a greater good like breaking lincoln out of prison but the dance of good and and the manipulation itself becomes the most important thing becomes about winning rather than whether the i dont think ive seen they say for ramadan as an act of forgiveness theyre going to release all prisoners from solitary over there back into general population worst of the worst isil fanatics abu ramal theyre going to kill me you know government gave me  years for homosexuality but the monsters in there ramal and his men wont let me live  minutes please tell me you still plan on you were responsible and then your sheik at exactly the wrong time i dont know what happened to him maybe i can find another way there is something you could do give me a piece of that gum piece of gum is going itll start the process sometimes my friend i your plans or your lies i take that personally and im gonna show you just this piece of gum is gonna that will finish on the battery please prison lighter whip i need your socks sid water can how we doing

ill tell you one day theyre destroying our city your isil friends are and you come in here wanting help just give me a little something is there a doctor here im burning up you should have thought about that when you supplied guns to them assassinated good men those charges were a misunderstanding oh allah kaniel outis says it was a misunderstanding was it also a misunderstanding when you tried to escape the moment you got into this prison hmm an honest man doesnt try to escape he asks for a lawyer but you you tried to escape the very first week id have left you in solitary the address at

went to visit him a few weeks ago he said maybe there is a way out a way i could help a man is not a man if he would let his family die you agreed to help him how he said if i could arrange a blackout he he knew someone an american i dont know ii was supposed to do this a week ago but then this happened with my daughter thank god you found us theres still time to do it theyre waiting for you in

get out of this hole  michaels reaching out to us your brother speaks in riddles does he isil were gonna get stopped why dont we forget beautys not so easily forgotten friends in high places bagwell i can equip you with a  whos behind this  this is kaniel outis  who michael scofield was something people are trying jacob thats game theory you meet people you bring them into your life until the moment you need to manipulate the relationship to your advantage you agreed to help him how if i could arrange a blackout he knew someone who could get him out someone found my father it means the escape is on isil forces are also bent on freeing their leader abu ramal known for his extreme _ _ _ _ he says bubble gum man sent him someone in the prison he hasnt met but gives him gum in he says hes frightened tell him its all right ask him if he does tic tacs he can have the whole lot if he keeps the messages coming thank you tic tac man tic tac tic tac tic tacs its a passage from the suras and yusef said to the prisoner remember me in the but satan made him forget and yusef stayed in prison for several years the calligraphy is unusual the spacing the way its shaped like like spokes on a wheel like the center of sanaa you think his brother sent us a map theres a red dot dotting the i and whatever this is here hes trying to give us a location a location for what the only thing i can

sold the auto shop to an american four years ago and hasnt seen him since you know that american question is what was planning his escape it looks like his original exfil point was at the northern border wont be doing that now its isil territory mockups passport photos disguises but it looks like he just wasnt he was getting abu ramal out this guys the enemy of everything thats civilized linc that brings me to my real question who in the hell are we breaking out is it michael scofield or kaniel outis  synced and corrected by vitosilans  _ _ what the hells going on ramals men are gonna and

ripping the city apart theyre animals ive been a bureaucrat my whole life hated it corruption backslapping but today maybe some i went to grammar school with this boy named ibrahim all the years later you uh saying this judge can help us i called him a few about your brothers case _ redecorating i see just readying for the luxury is something the so luxury will stay behind closed doors you should flee the country im a survivor you know that i thought mr burrows could perhaps help with his brothers cause ah yes a full pardon from the but you will have to uphold jamil german engineering  miles five liter seven speed v it will be a welcome bit of luxury behind closed doors of course best of luck to both of you i really appreciate this thank you its already done it wouldve been left behind anyhow may both of our families get safely out of sanaa tonight we cant just sit here and die youyou got a window maybe we can pry it its too small reinforced built into the rebar infrastructure you got people on the outside right and theyre gonna try and get us out they were supposed last night and we didnt show we cant just quit  and let poseidon beat us theres a way out if we work together but escape has to start from your cell im no longer interested the only thing left beg that i might let you if only as a slave ive been a slave for i wont do it anymore i will miss you when youre dead but

third person like youre not him state department has been looking for poseidon for years you idiot hes a rogue cia operative nobody knows who he is  here we go above your pay grade i mean were talking right a hawk who apparently doesnt goes about foreign policy and decided to take not with armies not with invasions but by getting a single person killed by getting a single by getting a single person prison like the one in you want my guess its abu ramal that poseidon wants free guy i seen on the prison telly wait i thought the cia was  not release them he doesnt report to anybody he just pursues his own ideology okay for instance listen lets say you think russia and iran are having too much and you dont think washington is getting the job done you free ramal sure hes an islamic radical nut job but he will fight iran the enemy of my enemy is my friend and whats so shrewd about poseidon is he does it all without a network which is why hes so hard to find one man can pull strings like that one man manipulating abu ramal is a monster and theres a spot in but the hottest spot is because he is letting ramal those men they have thousands on their hands compared to them you and  angels you find out who poseidon is and how scofield is wrapped up in it maybe your fate is to be a patriot what go go theres a time for everything  i need help now theyre going over the top lets go go go go go

i had to fake my death go away it was part of the deal i made if i went to work for named poseidon we would all go free we were free we were exonerated no thats what we thought but we were wrong a few weeks before i married sara i was approached by poseidon you think im showing im not used to that yet i got to i got to tell michael here you go burgers will  be just a second yes this is michael poseidon told me kellerman didnt have the authority or jurisdiction he used that as a legal fulcrum told me he could put within the mandate of the law unless unless i went to work for him what the hell can they be talking about at a time like this i dont know but big brothers hearing we cannot stay we must go now maybe we dont what the hell are you talking about maybe all this running is just delaying the inevitable die alone here die alone at home god you need a girlfriend man those voices are heading our who the hell is this poseidon guy a psychopath a frustrated policy wonk in the cia who felt he could do so he created a cell within implementing his own and he needed my help breaking out people terrorists political dissidents rogue agents and if i did it you your records expunged but there was a rub i wasnt allowed to have including my son michael so michael scofield was dead and over the years i assumed many names kaniel outis the most recent why didnt you tell me why didnt you reach out to me i didnt have a choice poseidon made that very clear how at first i said no i wouldnt do it then within weeks sara and so i gave in everything i did i did for family for you for

difference does it make they got it end of story apd northwest area command on second they tagged it they filed it its in the system and they locked it in their evidence room all right all right so describe the building describe the how about i describe fort knox and what are you gonna do are you gonna put on your black leotard and go dangling on a clothesline its a building full of cops what else do you need to know and why in the hell am i talking to you mike we gotta do something i am doing something hes good with this stuff okay just give him a chance now you look that laptop might as well be on the moon they build these evidence rooms like bank vaults because guess what lunatics like you wanna break into them but unlike a bank vault this is a place that is guarded  hours a day by the police theres no way youre getting it out of there who said that we have to get it out of there we just need to destroy whats on it oh so now you wanna blow up a police station i dont believe i said that no nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite now you wanna kill a bunch of cops i never said anything about killing anybody i am however considering the possibility of a device  a device  yes a small device say this device gets filed into evidence  now it is inside that room  what about a magnet you wanna commit a whole other crime just to get this bomb into evidence  who said bomb i said a device  what about a magnet an incendiary device one quick fire is all it would take you dont think they have fire suppression im not talking sprinklers im talking about halon because halon doesnt destroy evidence  a magnet though maybe like  a bomb then we plant a bomb outside oh actually i knew a crew out of fort worth that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside about all they did was take out a couple of hedges you are probably talking about  feet of reinforced concrete or what about a magnet what magnet what about it you know just so what do you think expensive leaving aside engineering rigging some kind of alternate power source my primary sticking point is i actually need the thing as you gentlemen can see its paying the bills but i mean its feasible doable hey were living in a time of string theories and god particles feasible doable yeah sure why not expensive what would you put it in what about that does it run we can get it running whats the box made of plywood and aluminium just what you need all right so you wanna talk money step into my office hey listen i dont actually have any money right now my wife theres an irs issue anyway id appreciate it if you could spot me my share ill pay you back yeah whatever right you coming if you have any brains youll take that money you saved and youll skip town today right now you dont think this can work is that a serious question mike this is a threeman job the only way i know it wont work for sure is if we dont have you come in get in close the door what did we say about you coming here yeah speaking of things that tend to rile you up the police they may call let me back up a little can i sit down im gonna sit down okay why are the police gonna call may call you distant outside possibility but on the off chance i want you thinking one thought hogans heroes sergeant schultz you remember sergeant schultz i know nothing i see nothing you remember how he i want you like

wanting to know where they keep the thing and he told them jesus anything left of the laptop do we look that lucky i sneaked a peek before apd took it out of frings office the whole thing was encrypted they wouldnt have got anything anyway but so hector salamanca killed fring but who gave salamanca the bomb whole lot of questions and not much in the way of answers yet the apd did find some of frings financials that just might lead to something i had him out to my house fourth of july we cooked out in the backyard my son shucked the corn my daughter cut up potatoes fring brought sea bass every time i grill it now i make a little foil pouch just like he showed me that whole night we were laughing telling stories drinking wine and hes somebody else completely right in front of me right

sunglasses i feel like im talking to jackie onassis here there you go breathe in breathe out drink your whatever who killed gus havent i told you not to worry about that now what do you want from me and why is it so important whats this a list of  names okay you know them all i do those  men and i think you know this mike those  could sink us you and me both  where are we going with this  no specific im just pointing out facts these men your men yours and gus they were on the payroll very publicly they trace back to pollos the laundry to madrigal theyre gonna get picked up by the police when they do and threatened and theres only one way out and im not saying all of them okay all its gonna take is two or three or even one but theres always a weak link but theyre gonna talk at least ones gonna talk about you me and thats all its gonna take these are the  i know of but id love your input i never met your chemist for instance id love your input you want me to kill every man on that list thats a leap what you just no i didnt say that but if you think thatd be wise youre scared arent you yeah youre very upset which im gonna factor into my response here these are my guys and they are solid  understand  what about chow at the warehouse didnt you have to shoot him through the hand  think that didnt stick in his memory  what about dennis at the laundry  theyre sure to pick him up  they already have they picked him up last night my guys are solid i vetted them with great care and fring made sure they were well compensated in the event of a situation such as this theyre paid to stand up to the heat keep their mouths shut no matter what and they will i dont know what movies youve been watching but in the real world we dont kill   people as some kind of prophylactic measure look at me and say you understand i understand  i get it  so were off that very silly idea good drink your hot water i gotta go did you have enough yeah im good okay byebye  bye  bye bye big brother say bye to mom for me i will have a good day you too skyler hey the car wash opens in  minutes mariano can open for me today hey how about you get up huh come on a shower will feel good hey chow how you holding up okay you know they they talked to me you cant smoke in here chow thanks for coming down have a seat mr ehrmantraut am i saying that right close enough once more youre waiving your right to have an attorney present correct could you state that to the camera im waiving my right to have an attorney present okay then we just have a few questions youre currently employed by the pollos hermanos chain  is that correct  yes i am  what do you do there  corporate security  corporate security  yeah whats that like guarding the special sauce i conduct employee background checks i oversee loss prevention at a fastfood restaurant thats a fulltime job we have  locations so yes its a fulltime job yeah well if i were you id start sending out those r√£sum√£s it says here youre a private investigator  where you licensed  new mexico arizona utah every state where we operate colorado you have some restaurants there right  colorado doesnt require licensure  licensed to carry a firearm  concealed carry yes i am  which states itd be quicker to mention the states in which im not and if we pulled your ccps everything would be in order im guessing youve already done that so you tell me you strike me as a former cop am i right where at  philadelphia  philly the city of brotherly love turns out we know some folks there and they told us that your tenure as a police officer ended somewhat dramatically  you wanna talk about that  not particularly yeah me neither see im more interested in why gus fring decided to put a guy like you in charge of his corporate security i mean given your history doing background checks on pimplefaced fry cooks seems like overkill what else you do for fring he mustve needed help running that drug empire of his no drug empire first im hearing about that i dont know anything about that we have a guy that could put you in that underground lab and hell testify to it so from here on out this can go hard or easy so whats it gonna be forget your handcuffs im confused am i under arrest here or am i not you wanna state that for the camera you are not under arrest currently agents do you have any more questions for me because youve got me very stirred up with all these false accusations if im not under arrest id prefer to leave oh well i suppose we could talk about the  million in your granddaughters name yeah it seems fring had all these secret offshore accounts that he would deposit money into like well an even dozen of them and theyre all in the names of certain people on his payroll the manager of the laundry a couple guys from the pollos distribution centre there was the owner of a chemical warehouse a bunch of others you know guys that mustve been getting paid off the books anyway one of the names was kaylee ehrmantraut ten years old and just cute as a button yeah two million and change we found on deposit for her way more than anybody else now my partner here he took one look at that and said shit man this fifthgrade girl is the muscle behind frings entire operation i said whoa whoa hey partner slow down there maybe it was actually her dear old granddaddy impressive no thatlevel of insight hes not impressed gomey perhaps hes picturing all that money going byebye yeah well i mean the governments gonna take every last dollar unless heres the thing mike or michael  mr ehrmantraut  heres the thing mike lucky you didnt touch that money i cannot say the same for the other  on the list one of your guys is gonna roll and then well definitely remember the handcuffs now before that day comes you can do yourself a solid you can tell us what you know you can tell us whos still out there and if we like your story good things can happen kaylee might be able to keep some of that money maybe so what do you say i dont know anything about any money i dont know what youre talking about first order of business is to find a new place to cook before anyone says it  no more rvs  i dont know  the crystal ship did pretty good for us  the crystal ship yeah thats what i called it well ill admit it held its own as a starter lab but it was too dark too small not to mention it couldve broken down at any moment saul find us someplace safe from prying eyes security against detection is paramount but i dont wanna drive too far no more mile treks to some indian reservation in town is trickier i mean you got a lot more of your prying eyes if gus can manage it then so can we precursor where are we with that were good on everything except methylamine no surprise its dry as hell out there what if we switched back to a pseudo cook absolutely out of the question jesse there is methylamine out there i know it yeah but what if theres not because there isnt i mean really there is have faith can i offer a thought say a guy wins the lottery ten million bucks the very next day whats the one thing he does not do he does not go buy another lottery ticket right he counts his lucky stars and he sails off into the sunset which seems to me and all due respect some advice you two might take what lottery did i win exactly hey youre alive i mean as far as im concerned thats the irish sweepstakes im alive and im

this under duress duly noted all right let him in huell mike im extending you now that were all together here are the ground rules division of labour i handle the business making the stuff thats your end i dont tell you how to mix your chemicals and whatnot and you do not tell me how to take care of business is that absolutely clear  sure  all right lets take the tour hey youre okay with that yes he handles the business and i handle him clearly were talking about renting not buying you need an ongoing business someplace you can slide in do your thing and remain anonymous im not gonna mince words this is your best bet got machines running forklifts people coming and going youre gonna stay way under the radar and the owners solid he cant wait to throw up a curtain wall stack some boxes in front of it give you the space you need after that hes got his business youve got yours and never the twain shall meet its outstanding am i right machines like this gotta be plenty of power what about the smell more good news ive been here when its up and running this place stinks already  youll blend right in  how many employees i knew youd ask sixteen illegals all highly motivated to stay deaf blind and dumb youll want to vet them im sure yes indeed so what do you say maestro is it unanimous you know i worked in a box factory one summer in high school and i havent seen one of these in years trip down memory lane thats perfect you know what this is its a corrugator it uses steam and salt to crimp kraft paper for cardboard and it makes a hell of a racket doing it which is great right no steam and salt when this thing is running its like a jungle in here shit itll ruin the product you cant just pop down to costco and get a couple dehumidifiers what fine fine moving on spacious isolated location no humidity and you get all the free tortillas you want thats the special feature of this place i dont know itll make the tortillas smell like cat piss somebodys bound to notice that all right well theres gotta be some kind of workaround right its a technical problem you guys are technical guys you know be creative put your heads together anything foodrelated is gonna have unannounced government inspections all im asking is that you keep an open mind dannys already set some space aside behind the skeeball games  no  hell no i know its a long shot all i can say to recommend this is were talking about an owner here who is how should i put it highly amenable look i get it just say no and well go get dinner all right so ill start no way were cooking in here no space nowhere for the smell to go look at that door that thing rolls up and were open to the world i dont know if anybody noticed but theres a cop shop a quarter of a mile away the hammer comes down its gonna be custers last stand  its perfect  what how are we gonna fit a lab in here who said here a house is infested termites cockroaches whatever homeowners hire a pest control company truck rolls up homeowners leave the crew tents the house they bomb the place with poison the house stays like that for days no one looks twice at a tented house now maybe theres a strange smell coming out of it does someone think to investigate no does anyone go inside hell no and thats where well cook they tent what three four houses a week so we pick the one thats best for us enough floor space easy access once the tent is up we go in we cook a batch we bomb the place and leave so we gotta move in and out for every cook set up a lab cook and then take everything down its challenging but doable tell me about these guys mr ponytail on the sidewalk thats ira hes the owner on the roof is sandor the ladders fernando and down below thats todd the pest control operation is legit i mean theyre licensed theyre bonded they do as good a job as anyone in town but theyre also topdrawer secondstorey men  secondstorey  b and e artists theyre burglars yeah i mean hey they play it smart they dont boost anything while theyre on the job they copy the keys locate the valuables and alarms and they sell that information to other crews or after a decent interval  theyll lift the goods themselves  and you know them how oh ive been pulling their chestnuts out of the fire legally speaking for five years ira and his guys are good i mean they know how to keep their mouths shut and if you buy them theyre gonna stay bought you can check into them yourself i will if it comes to that so do we take a vote why  we sound great  rock on man solid that yamahas got a real nice touch you like the sound its huge huh yeah its real nice but were looking for something else today  you got any roadie cases  for sure what size biggest you got thatll fit through like a regularsize doorway you got it follow me top of the line recessed hardware foam lining quarterinch laminated walls inch casters height is good width is good how much weight will this hold its rated for  pounds so unless your band plays lead bricks you should be okay were gonna need hey man im trying to do business over here bitch sorry hes like overly enthusiastic anyway im gonna need four of them four that gonna be layaway because i need to see a bunch of ids for that no man cash okay hey you know what ill throw in stencilling whats your band called damn brother not asking no questions but it sure looks like youre back in business no joke you way back in business man look at this yeah youre stacking the benjies till the rubber band pops yeah yeah alls were saying is we know youre major league now but if theres ever anything else you need from us any way we can get in on this at all little stuff big stuff we would be all over it you know maybe someday thats cool i guess we better hit it then yeah keep on keeping on brother later okay it is the same job as always you go out you inspect you deal with the customers regular drill everythings the same except for one important detail  no stealing  no stealing not a toothpick not the spare change between the couch cushions not the panties out of the hamper nothing and i mean nothing if youre out with your buddies and they ask if you got a hot tip on a b and e you tell them you got nada youre out of the game the bottom line is that these houses are out of bounds now and forever got it all right from time to time youre gonna see these two now as far as youre concerned they are ghosts you dont see them you dont hear them you dont say good morning you dont speak unless youre spoken to on the other hand if they tell you to jump you dont ask what for you jump now you need a name for them you call them yes sir and no sir you got any problems you come to me heres the deal the finishing tanks a tight fit  and with this motor youve got on top  the agitation motor the agitation motor here on top the tanks not gonna fit in the box its just its just too tall you know i thought wed put a collar on the tank and carry the motor in separately alongside the condenser and on the day we just kind of twist it into place you know while were setting up  yeah  yeah  thats good  yeah that will work and joe and his guys can build it right yeah you know theyre up for it joe already bought a tig welder for the aluminium work and you know i figure if they can pull off the magnet they can handle this now listen about the smell about keeping it out of peoples drapes and furniture and whatnot when i was down in mexico there was this big big plastic hospital tent they set up inside of the oh shit sorry oh hi sorry no no no we were just wrapping up  this is my  friend hi walt  nice to meet you  you too this is brock hi brock im walt ive heard a lot about you  hi  hi i understand you were in the hospital and jesse told me that you were very brave yeah a man of few words im sorry he mostly just wants to play his game oh i know that i have two of my own a boy and a girl well i should go i was thinking i could make us all some dinner are you sure you dont wanna yeah why dont you stay for a beer at least sure why not a beer sounds good thank you  how are you today sir  were good good how are you  family all packed up ready to go  yeah here youre acknowledging that youve removed all pets and plants from the house and that food has been removed or doublesealed in the bags we provided this acknowledges youve removed or bagged any medicine tobacco pet food better make sure you got any medicine you might need  its already in the car  okay holy crap how much poison are you using its not how much its getting it where its needed those are your foggers they disperse the fumigate into the structure where itll eliminate any nymphs or larvae as well as the fullgrown blattodea so do we have all your keys any extras on here you might wind up needing  no im good  okay this last one here acknowledges that you have been informed that you may not reenter the premises until it has cleared the postfumigation inspection so youre gonna get them all right well

absolutely cut the cards have you thought about what your plan is you know vis√£¬†vis honesty you mean how much she knows about this she doesnt know anything i mean you know shes not stupid she knows im into something but she could make a pretty good guess but i never told her anything im not gonna okay i mean it i know you do jesse i cant pretend that this doesnt affect me it does but with everything that weve been through the two of us this has to be your decision i mean youve earned that seriously yeah secrets create barriers between people im speaking from experience believe me all that youve done its a part of you and i mean if you choose to spend the rest of your life with this person then youll have to decide how much youll share with her meaning what like everything like gale im just trying to say that i trust you and i know youll make the right call if she loves you shell understand theyre leaving streaks this more ethniclooking one hes doing a great job but the other one is going back and forth like hes scrubbing a wall they have to go in circles or youre going to leave streaks thats pretty basic right i dont mean to tell you your business its just its simple quality control so ive got some good news guess what what no really i want you to guess  marie i really  okay hanks back at work  thats wonderful  yeah sure they love him now but where were they when he needed them merkert and all the rest they laughed him out of the office when he told them about that chicken man as far as im concerned too little too late if it were me id tell them all

wait a minute after the dealers got their cut we should be looking at  mike youre short youre almost  short youre forgetting about the mules they get a flat  percent  the what  the drivers theyre the ones that take the product from us to the dealers and so transportation is worth  percent theyre taking a risk two hundred and seventyfive thousand dollars worth of risk what did gus pay his mules gustavo fring didnt use mules he didnt need them he spent  years building his own distribution he had  refrigerator trucks running his product and do you know where they are now government impound you dont like paying  percent maybe you shouldnt have killed the guy hey hey theres still over a million bucks here all right thats for one cook and since youre putting on the green eyeshade my supplier and i came to an agreement the methylamine is free this time but brace yourself because the next barrel is gonna cost big can we continue or you got any more burning questions okay kid you fronted us  to get us going so thats  from him and me one hundred and twenty yes thank you jesse okay now ira gets  for our piece of the business and  per cook that is  from each of us iras guys get  each per cook goodmans cut  from each legacy cost  thats  each legacy cost i got nine guys you dont know them but they were part of the previous operation and they know a lot and right now some of them are in jail and more will be soon the feds ricoed their hazard pay so we are gonna make them whole we are gonna make them whole what is this we these were gus employees not ours they might have been gus employees but theyre my guys so what are they doing to further our interests the cops are looking at them very closely we dont want them furthering our interests so we are paying them why because its what you do its what you do my guys are keeping their mouths shut we make them whole one hand washes the other its as simple as that it sounds like a simple shakedown simple as that were paying for their silence thats blackmail business is my end this is business end of story this is your problem it should come out of your end hey hey just take it out of mine all right go for it i dont care just take it no jesse thank you but no ill pay my share go ahead let me tell you something this is how its gonna be from here on out my guys are an ongoing expenditure so you best get yourself comfortable with it a hundred and thirtyseven thousand thats less than with fring listen walter just because you shot jesse james dont make you jesse james tomorrow how are you feeling okay i guess broke it off with andrea i had to shes gonna tell brock im still gonna take care of the rent and stuff  its the right thing to do but you know  i meant this how are you feeling about the money youre looking at it wrong when we worked for gus we were cooking  pounds a week this last batch was great but we didnt even crack  pounds we maybe cleared less money but we got a bigger piece of the pie its like you said were owners not employees ive been thinking about victor yeah yeah all this time i was sure that gus did what he did to send me a message maybe theres another reason like what victor trying to cook that batch on his own taking liberties that werent his to take maybe he flew too close to the sun got his throat cut  gotta say when you first brought her in i had my doubts but your little darlings got nine lives rearwheel assembly took the brunt of the impact so yeah cv shaft boots joints axle replaced all of it no way around it i went aftermarket on most of the parts here you want me to swap in factory parts thats fine but using aftermarkets the only way well keep it under blue book and on the insurance companys dime okay nothing beats free swapped out your air filter topped off your fluids didnt have to replace the windshield this time i know right oh and i noticed you had some sort of gunky buildup in the front end here first i had no idea what i was looking at then i remembered you had me replace that front fender a few months back when you ran over that deer we went at it with the steam hose cleaned it up for you hardest part was the paint fern green interesting tint anything else thats it zero balance like i said sign here youre good to go people like to joke but i really really like this car shes sturdy as all hell im betting you get another  miles out of her hey benny what would you give me for it  whats the blue book you mean  no i mean what will you pay me for this car  well im not really looking for  a hundred dollars fifty insurance company just shelled out  for the parts alone then its a bargain you give me  bucks and shes all yours you sure about this sure as shooting ill check the register dad fifty bucks are you crazy  gotta be kidding me  lydia oh christ im at work right now yeah i know this is a headsup you got visitors visitors what you mean today i mean  seconds come in ms rodartequayle agent hank schrader agent steve gomez dea we

the warehouse okay the warehouse besides ron was my guy remember i dont have a guy anymore ron fixed security pulled the barrels drove the truck you cant expect me to do that stuff i mean lets be realistic mike this is crazy ill send a new guy youre crazy my car almost has  horsepower  it would totally smoke  horsepower isnt everything dont you know that you have to factor in drag and torque

know you dont approve but mine well call a birthday present to myself and juniors people will just chalk that up as me being a softy and besides i didnt actually buy either one theyre both leases so it all fits our story okay we can afford it now youre back at it well yeah we have to make up that  we lost what do you think about boarding school boarding school for who for junior yeah theres this place in northern arizona and its supposed to be one of the top  in the country hes a year away from college why on earth would we do that i i dont know i just just thinking about the kids holly too where are we sending our monthold peace corps no i just a new environment might be good for them what does that mean whats wrong with their environment skyler whats wrong with their environment nothing hey listen i know these last few weeks have been rough the threat to hank and this whole thing with beneke but theres absolutely nothing for you to be afraid of anymore okay i mean clear sailing from here on out i promise you know i want us to try and start looking forward to things again speaking of which my birthday i dont know i dont know what you have planned and with everything thats been going on lately id understand if you havent even given it a thought but i think a little celebration might be good for all of us you know a birthday party what do you think yeah okay and maybe if i may be so bold chocolate cake with chocolate icing life is good skyler  thank you  hey mom you forgot something dads bacon thats okay i can do it no mom has to well it is sort of a

screwing with us so whats next i dont know i dont know this madrigal thing seems hinky though you know we got burgermeister meisterburger in germany and  miles away you got this guy theres gotta be someone in the middle you know someone were missing what about that lydia whatshername lady banjo eyes at the warehouse in this world no way too uptight too together maybe she was wearing mismatched shoes how together can she be gentlemen how goes it with fring you know just working through the grief how soon before you submit a final well weve been kicking around some ideas had you asked a couple of weeks ago id have said this was a mopup job but  but  none of frings crew is talking to us i mean not a peep no matter how hard we squeeze makes it likely theres somebody keeping them in line our money is on this guy michael ehrmantraut hes frings head of corporate security  hes a definite hard case  now were gonna stay on him were putting together a surveillance team as we speak okay the other thing is this may be unrelated but the blue meth is making a bit of a comeback tell him gomey yeah some small amounts on the streetside pulls labs telling us its the same stuff i mean it could be old inventory leaking out or it could be somebodys rebooting using frings former cooks to set up a new operation i thought we had frings cooks the unsubs in the lab fire thought maybe one of them was your heisenberg yeah maybe i dont know like i said theres still a lot of questions agent gomez could you give us a moment yeah hank i gotta say your work here has been stellar really firstrate thank you sir so much so that im wondering if its time you made a change you know i have to get back to el paso this office needs an asac and im thinking we should be promoting from within if you were to put in an application and i recommend that you do you will get the job i have no doubt this do would be well served with you at the helm thats im not sure what to say its a big step up its not without its headaches the politics may take some getting used to youd be overseeing every case in the office so youd need to reassign all your daytodays fring included much as i hate losing a good field man thats the job and you need to be okay with it what do you say hank you want it well considering my wife would murder me if i said no yeah i want it  congratulations  thank you can you

jesus yeah right  yeah  it seems like longer doesnt it  yeah no its one year ago tomorrow the day after my th honestly never thought id make it this far with the cancer and surgery and hank being shot it just so many dark days well theres maries talking pillow remember that it was effective boy i did not want to get any treatment i think i was too scared or too angry or i dont know i just wanted to quit but you guys you got me through it somehow kept me going and that happened again and again and again i mean there were times when i was sure i was done for but then someone or something would come through for me god and skyler i cant honey remember that first week of chemotherapy that night on the bathroom floor what you said to me i was so sick it was rough going at first but skyler she was right there of course putting wet washcloths on my forehead and shes singing to me and this would go on and on day after day and i remember i was lying on the floor of the bathroom because the tile felt nice and cool you know and my head was in skylers lap and i was just asking her if this could all be over it was too hard it was i just wanted it stopped skyler isnt that freezing heyo pool party what are you doing skyler what is she doing walt hey sky maybe its time to get out now what do you think skyler hank asked you a question you need to get out skyler shes gonna come up right she has to skyler oh my god wha okay okay its gotta be nope okay come on how am i supposed to hey wait wait wait who are you im the im the guy so wheres the hold on hold on who sent you who sent me who do you think no im asking you mike and this mike person whats his last name lady i just got off a plane from new mexico and i got a mile drive back thats  hours if i dont stop so the sooner we do this the sooner its done ehrmantraut okay satisfied sorry but im not gonna apologise for being careful with all thats been happening for all i knew you were one of those undercover people so yeah ill take paranoid any day over getting gangraped by prison guards no doubt so wheres the up there number  thats the one i erased from the inventory so it has to be that one can you reach it yeah with like a forklift you got one wait wait wait stop  oh my god oh my god  what please tell me thats not what i think it is has anything like this ever happened before no no of course not no no i just she and i have been having some issues yeah yeah i mightve heard a little bit about that i mean hey look marie didnt go into detail she just you know said that you know you guys were having some issues so whats the next move might be good to have her talk to someone  i agree  yeah  im gonna get on that first thing  yeah theres maries guy dave she seems really happy with him not that maries an advertisement for advanced mental health or anything you know i just had no idea she was taking it this hard some birthday huh shes gonna try and get some sleep okay what was that i dont know  i mean was she trying  no not in a swimming pool no with all of us there no i dont think so but we both think that she should talk to someone im gonna get you daves number okay listen walt i i cant help but sense that there may be some issues between you and skyler none of our business of course and hank i dont know if youve  picked up on any of the  he knows he knows i know these things happen in a marriage but it isnt unfixable i think what would be great is if you two had some space to work through this stuff so and keep an open mind here what if we took the kids for a while  took the kids  absolutely well look after them for a day or two or however long and leave you and skyler to look after each other thats very generous of you marie but i i just dont see how thats a solution and i mean besides junior and holly thats a lot of work no it isnt juniors independent and my niece is only the easiest most delicious baby that was ever born  itll be fun right  yeah yeah no yeah yeah absolutely yeah its a good idea well i think its a great idea just the thing for both of you marie this idea was it yours actually it was skylers she really needs this walt yep i gave marie bottles theyll stop and pick up diapers along the way i spoke with junior on the phone and after much discussion he agreed to swing by tomorrow pick up some clothes and so voil√£¬† the kids are out of this environment what a coincidence i know youre awake what was that about can you explain it i dont want the children here anymore it isnt safe skyler we have talked about this repeatedly it has never been more safe never been a couple weeks ago a man was coming to this house to kill us to murder your entire family you were in the crawlspace screaming and i dealt with him its over it is not youre right back in the meth business again this is different now im running things so wait now that youre in charge its what its gonna be smooth sailing from here on out i dont see why not i keep the work at work skyler and nothing will ever impact you or the kids you dont know that you cant make that promise walt i can promise you that gus fring is dead and he was the threat he was the danger i thought you were the danger is that what your pool stunt was about trying to protect my children from me not just you theres blood on my hands too what blood beneke hes in the hospital because of me  no  because of what i did skyler you cant beat yourself up over this thing please you didnt set out to hurt anybody you made a mistake and things got out of control but you did what you had to to protect your family im sorry that doesnt make you a bad person it makes you a human being stop it walt just stop i dont need to hear any of your bullshit rationales im in it now im compromised but i wont i will not have my children living in a house where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people is shrugged off as shit happens were back at it fine but the kids stay away and thats that thats that thats what i got them out of this house to a sleepover at their aunt and uncles they spend a day or two junior stays up late watching movies and then what happens  well see  no ill tell you what happens they come home to this house to their parents who love them no i will not let our business endanger them how many times do i have to say  that they are not in  i said no i swear to god i wont have them back here what are you gonna do to stop it whatever it takes everything in my power like what i mean specifically what is your next move my next move is maybe i hurt myself make it clear we need more time let hank and marie see were still struggling no more like youre still struggling so maybe next time i have you committed put you in some inpatient facility while i take care of the kids myself is that what you want so then maybe i show up with bruises on my neck give myself a black eye say that you beat me when you found out about my lover i see so you want to involve ted oh well thatll be fun bringing the police up to speed on all of that but not as much fun as telling your yearold son that his father is a wifebeater also not a very good plan what else you got  i could send junior away to school  now heres the conversation so honey i know youve only got one year left in high school but i would love it if youd drop everything leave all your friends behind and go to boarding school in arizona you have any other ideas because im not hearing a solution to your problem how are you going to save our kids from this terrible environment  i dont  what are you gonna do run off to france you gonna close the curtains change the locks this is a joke come on skyler you wanna take me on you wanna take away my children  whats the plan  i dont know this is the best i could come up with okay i will count every minute that the kids are away from here away from you as a victory but youre right its a bad plan i dont have any of your magic walt i dont know what to do im a coward i i cant go to the police i cant stop laundering your money i cant keep you out of this house i cant even keep you out of my bed all i can do is wait thats it thats the only good option hold on bide my time and wait wait for what what are you waiting for for the cancer to come back yeah okay okay just relax im coming look at that you tell me what that looks like if the deas tracking her barrels there goes our precursor connection thats done and im telling you these days chances of getting a new methylamine hookup is rare man its like bigfoot like unicornrare kid its just youre giving me heartburn here gps on the bottom of the barrel why didnt they put it inside where nobody would see it look its inside it gets wet they made these things to put under cars it can get wet even by cop standards this is sloppy and the other barrels they have trackers on the outside too i dont know probably you didnt check any of the other barrels no but thats the only one we couldve taken according to her once we spotted it she freaked out i put the barrel back and we fod let me ask you something the person who spotted this was it you or was it her lydia she saw it first okay shes dead wait wait wait what lydia planted this thing not the cops shes thinking if she makes it look like her inventorys being watched that well leave her alone and take our business elsewhere and shes right we will be taking our business elsewhere right after i leave her alone in a ditch but wait hey if the deas not tracking her stuff thats a good thing right i mean all we gotta do is tell her to cut the crap and keep the methylamine coming you dont know this woman like i do i had a chance to deal with this before and i gave her a pass thats what i get for being sexist  now if youll excuse me  mike you cant just look thats our precursor we need her kid if we have to ramp down for a while so be it it beats working with a lunatic whos gonna get us arrested or killed look she didnt seem crazy to me you know she just seemed like uptight and now youre being sexist trust me this woman deserves to die as much as any man ive ever met wait just wait what if this really was the cops you know  and what if youre wrong about her  im not wrong but what if you are jesse your misgivings have been duly noted now move away from me no this is a voting thing  i dont think so  i vote its a voting thing mr white weigh in here would you what do you think mr white the methylamine keeps flowing no matter what we are not ramping down were just getting started nothing stops this train nothing hey yo mr white hold up hey i just wanted to say i liked your idea you know its pretty i think its the way to go oh hey you said it was your birthday so i left the receipt in the box in case you wanna exchange it anyway hey happy

to shoot you in the head look at me not at them lydia look at me if you make schrader suspicious in any way any way at all tell me whats gonna happen next  youll pull out your gun and shoot me  and where will i shoot you  in the head  in the head thats right and its a pistol not a gun im expecting precision here we up and running yeah computers set okay lydia if you ever needed to give the performance of a lifetime its now youre up asacs office hi lydia rodartequayle calling for agent schrader im sorry whats this regarding madrigal electromotive lydia rodarte quayle  hold please hank lydia rodartequayle on line one hank schrader how can i help you ms quayle well this is kind of an odd its just that i was in our warehouse supervising a shipment of chemicals when i noticed a device on the bottom of one of our barrels of methylamine  a device  yeah i guess youd call it that i mean im certainly no expert but it looks to me like some kind of a a tracking device or a gps so i was just wondering if maybe your people put it there not that its any of my business but the last thing i wanna do is interfere with a law enforcement operation or a sting or whatever you call it so i dont know maybe you could give me some guidance well ill tell you what set that barrel aside for me if you would and ill look into it and get back to you and in the meantime mums the word all right yeah all right sure thing okay great thanks for the call ms quayle byebye hey gomey come here would you  yeah  hey man you know anything about gps trackers on a methylamine barrel madrigal houston im talking about nope nobody from my team planted anything why oh i dont know i figured as much all right thanks i know what youre thinking but i didnt do it  im telling you i didnt plant that thing  shut up and there you have it like i said all right so now what its not the deas so schraders probably thinking some crew planted it looking for a weak spot to pull a heist hes gonna send a team over to that warehouse hes gonna wire it out the wazoo bugs cameras the whole nine yards so the warehouse is too hot her supply is useless to us now it depends on how fast schrader can get his guys there were  miles closer after all i say we keep listening suss out how much time we have if its at least  hours then we head down there use her security code to gain access and we take every barrel we can uhaul can only take six or seven before the suspension gives out its a stopgap but right now its the best we can do well what about her you two drive the barrels back tonight ill deal with her no no no no youre making a mistake this was not me i swear to god i didnt do it i dont know sounds like shes telling the truth to me she has a gun to her head kid everyone sounds like meryl streep with a gun to their head im sorry jesse youre the one who wanted to put it up to a vote its two against one no no you cant kill me come on i swear i didnt do anything janice give me doughty in the houston office will you you got it hank schrader for mr doughty hes on the line hey erol please tell me you guys didnt do something as lamebrained as put a gps tracker on the outside of a barrel of methylamine one earmarked for the madrigal warehouse in houston whos asking did someone find them jesus are you shitting me since when do you put a gps tracker  on the outside of a barrel  we didnt have time to go in with hazard suits hank they were about to ship we epoxied them to the bottom they were wellhidden oh really well not wellhidden enough how many barrels you tag all of them all the ones headed to the warehouse anyway christ all right well sit tight let me figure out how to play this next time a little communication first all right  yeah im sorry about that  asshole aside aside from the fact that we almost killed this woman all of those barrels are already marked we solve the problem we can this has not changed the equation one iota for her oh come on you are not seriously still considering killing me i saved you if it werent for me wed all be in jail right now i hate to say it but shes right mike she saved our asses by finding that thing she is saving herself shes a loose cannon i am telling you she will turn a gun or a badge on us the first chance she gets the woman put a hit out on me seriously wait a hit what like the mafia yeah like the mafia hey you still need methylamine dont you right you wanna talk methylamine then tell your partner to stop threatening me and lets talk talk about what you heard you cant even get us a single barrel who said anything about barrels im talking about an ocean of the stuff just give him a minute would you trust him trust him okay so lets hear it not without a guarantee that once i tell you how to get what you want  i wont be killed anyway  fine you have my word  not good enough  look lady  do you have children  that has nothing to do with this its not a trick question why dont you just answer it yes i have children so what you think that somehow because were both parents that i wont let my partner do whats necessary  swear on their lives  oh what swear on your childrens lives that i wont be harmed otherwise how can i trust you look youre a smart businesswoman you understand the concept of leverage  please dont patronize me i hate that  you have none but trust has to work both ways lydia is it true that you put a hit out on mike  yes  why i was scared  of mike  not at first there are men who used to work with gus fring in custody now nine of them they know everything about me everything some of them even know about you assuming youre the master chemist theyre always talking about and if its these nine that youre worried about  why put the hit on mike  i had no choice im not going to prison and have my daughter raised in a group home do you have any idea what those places are like i gave him a list of names but instead of handling it hes protecting them so i hired someone else at that point there was no option but to add mike to the list this ocean of methylamine that you claim you can get your hands on how much are we talking about literally how does  gallons sound once a week on a wednesday a freight train leaves the port of long beach loaded with industrial chemicals theres always at least one tanker car full of methylamine which we import from a manufacturer in guangzhou the train travels east through arizona stops at a rail yard outside flagstaff where it gets broken down and rebuilt but the methylamine always moves on destined for our pesticide concerns in texas and oklahoma which means that it passes right through your home state theres a remote threemile stretch here in mckinley county thats where you do it thats where we do what exactly get your methylamine  like rob it like jesse james  you want the stuff im offering you enough to fill a swimming pool you are offering us a quick trip to prison thats what im hearing stopping a train post  you have any idea how many alarms thatll set off between here and dc none if you do it right here if a freight train is stopped in transit anywhere other than the usual yards or depots absolutely a signal will alarm the fra and the tsa surface division at the department of homeland security but what you dont know and i do because my job requires me to keep track of my buyers shipments this is dark territory  whats that  trainspeak for an area of no contact its a dead zone no automated supervision system no alarms no contact with control what about cell phones  crew could just call the cops  no cellular either im telling you its the perfect place youd have time enough to stop the train siphon off as much methylamine as you can carry  get away before the police are called  wait a minute wait a minute assuming we can stop a moving train how do we know we have the right one and which tanker car is which i cant believe that they would advertise their contents once the train gets rebuilt in flagstaff a final manifest gets uploaded to my companys server ill have it for you sometime between midnight and  am thatll give you at least six hours of lead time keep in mind im taking a huge risk supplying this information i expect to be paid we can talk percentages later you know what this means dont you weve gotta off the crew how do you figure if we dont the engineers gonna call the cops as soon as he gets out of the dead zone its only three miles long  were way out in the boonies  i dont care if its in the gobi desert once they get word the fbi and homeland security are gonna swoop down with choppers on us so fast itll make our heads spin and there is no hiding in that open country  how many in the crew  just two  an engineer and a conductor  assuming there are no security guards no guards its not like were carrying nuclear warheads wait two guys cant we just tie them up or something and then what even if we wear a mask were leaving two witnesses behind bottom line i have done this long enough to know that there are two kinds of heists those where the guys get away with it and those that leave witnesses give me a break you guys were gonna murder me i thought you were professionals can you say asac asac can you say that say asac schrader if those turn out to be her first words i will beat you with my shoe  dont listen to him holly  im just telling it like it is babe boss man im the boss man say boss man am i the boss man im the boss hey that better be something from a boob instead of some fake soy crap  yeah yeah  my little girl  your little girl  deserves the real mccoy  no see  okay she doesnt want it no she wants me she wants me yeah my little girl because im not giving her back yeah i know what about emo mcgee has he come out of his room today barely when he does he barely talks yeah well what do you expect you know his parents treat him like hes a baby there flynn do you want me to heat up some of that lasagne to hold you over till dinner no hey i picked up heat on bluray wanna watch it with me later no and you can keep talking about me now well if no one else is gonna offer an opinion i will we do it the oldfashioned way we hit skid row the crystal palace all the halfway houses scrounge up about a dozen skells put them to work smurfing cold pills you mean switch back to a pseudo cook youre the chemist admittedly its gonna cut down on our output like a factor of four or five it also means that we will eat  we just invested in our new lab equipment which is only good for a pp cook you know i dont have to do the math to know that wed be making a fraction of the profit and making less money is better than making nothing oh yeah mike well why dont you tell us why why is making nothing not an option  walter  let me tell you why its because of your nine guys in lockup right you broke it you pay for it and weve talked about this plenty already well maybe we better talk about it a little more because what it sounds like youre telling me mike is that from now on we have no choice but to do this piddling pseudo cook so that we can pay back your guys or else what or else theyre gonna rat on us and we end up in prison yeah and it sounds like what youre telling me walter is that you wanna do this heist even if it means killing a couple of innocent men that what you want you know i dont know why you insist on putting words in my mouth here what if we can rip off that train and no one ever knows it got robbed maybe just maybe itll come from that direction seven seventyfive eight hundred eight fourteen wait a minute its perfect yeah we do it here we do it right here how are we looking mike all clear copy that go down go down you got it thats good fernando hey  this one  right  you good  yeah  whats your name again  todd todd on the day are you gonna be able to make this climb yes sir ill be ready all right  you mind if i ask you a question  no go ahead well i get why we want the tank for the methylamine but why this other one for the water well jesse its your idea you wanna fill him in its all about the weight yo the tanker were gonna hit gets weighed when it gets loaded in long beach and then again when its unloaded in texas if the weights dont match the train companys gonna know it got robbed okay boosting methylamine from a train is like a major rap the point is no one other than us can ever know that this robbery went down nobody you got it yeah absolutely are you sure yes sir with all that said the whole thing relies on us replacing the weight of methylamine we steal with the same weight in water so theyll never know we hit them cool aqueous methylamine is waterbased yet it weighs slightly less than water we will be removing a thousand gallons of methylamine from the tanker car but replacing it with about ninetenths of that volume in water which comes to  gallons actually jesse lets make that an even  to account for spillage and whatever will remain in the hose  yeah  how we doing by the way  eight fifty were almost there  all right wont they figure they got robbed getting watereddown methylamine well out of  gallons itll only amount to about four percent dilution so but yes youre right they will notice at which point they will blame china for sending a marginally weaker batch damn you guys thought of everything flynn flynn open the door just come out and talk to me im staying thats all i have to say  whats going on  you got what you wanted thats what congratulations its me open up come on junior im not gonna ask twice what you know what are you seriously kicking

know that  we explained that to you  you havent explained jack shit you want me out explain to me why why do i have to go to uncle hanks give me the exact reason or im not going anywhere this is not gonna be a debate whats going on why cant anybody tell me anything i want one good reason because were your parents and youre our child thats reason enough now please do as i ask now itll pass hell understand dont start walt i wont change my mind about you ever well i dont accept that youre my wife im not your wife im your hostage but since you insist on keeping me imprisoned ill make you a deal i will launder your money ill keep your secrets but the kids will stay at hank and maries where they have a chance of being safe i think youve seen too many movies our children are not in danger just a couple of days ago you told me that a man held a gun to your head you said it like it was a point of pride theres nothing you can say thatll convince me there wont come a day that somebody will knock on that door looking to harm you or me or all of us and when that day comes the children cannot be here you agree to that and i will be whatever kind of partner you want me to be okay by the way youre visiting a therapist from rio rancho peter last name is up to you out burying bodies robbing a train  yeah  its me ive got it okay mr white everythings set hey wallace up ahead stop the train now stop stop the train now go go go jesus thank god you guys werent asleep at the switch itd be like pancake city out here man hey you believe this i mean shit fire and save the matches talk about bum luck hey man im sorry to put you guys out like this whats the trouble with it no clue i was just driving down the road all of a sudden the old cow just bellied up and died on me either one of you guys know about engines oh of course you do thats why they call you an engineer right  all right  think its think its in there or something  you think  yeah probably a pretty good bet when was the last time you changed the oil i dont know man i just drive it  now go go go  were on  good  yeah go it looks good up here now hold up there it is i think this is the one  we good  yeah hey you wanna get in there give it a whirl all right let me give it a try  ready  ready  nothing  try again  nothing  all right maybe if we all pushed all right its worth a try any other ideas you just shout them out not at the moment i dont you coming so far so good give me a status were at  gallons and counting water is going now waters going in now were going with water now  good  yeah all right one two three you did remember to put it in neutral right yeah man give me a little credit you sure youre not out of gas i got a full tank here yeah this doesnt make any sense everything looks good why dont we just keep going over it theres gotta be something loose somewhere damn buddy picked a hell of a place to break down i know right crazy hey you know anything about engines not a whole lot i can push you off the tracks at least gee i wouldnt want you to mess up your ride  ill go slow wont get a scratch  youll screw up your nice shiny bumper hey were running late because of you the man said it was no problem come on already and thank you by the way yeah yeah absolutely pal thanks jesus walter weve got a good samaritan on the scene you pull your guys off that train right now were not done yet the track is clear walter i said get out of there  thank you mister much obliged  glad we could work that out for you  yeah no problem  you want a ride into town yeah yeah thanks walter they are back in the locomotive if you do not abort right now you are gonna get us all busted  ready  yeah mr white hey hold it hold it steady now close it off close it off todd get off get off yeah bitch  we did it  oh yeah oh my  okay okay nice job  yeah no no no no  you guys didnt tell me this stuff smells like cat piss man shit happens huh i mean im sorry but i had to do it obviously i guess you see it different some of you but i didnt see any other choice ive been thinking about this all day going over it in my head and it was the only way well its not like i wanted to the kid was on a dirt bike he couldve just he couldve gunned it and been gone before we even had a chance to blink we never wouldve caught him i thought on my feet i saw a threat  and i took care of it  a threat the kid was waving at us he wasnt going anywhere he was saying hi  yeah but you dont know that  yeah i do  he didnt know what hed seen  i didnt want to take that chance the whole point of this was no one was supposed to know we were there people werent supposed to know anything got robbed how could we let the kid go he made us if i hadnt done what i did the mission wouldve failed im real sorry i really am but i but did i make a mistake mr white because to me you know respectfully i was looking out for the team i didnt want to kill him you gotta believe that at the end of the day it was him or us and i chose us and i would do it again okay look todd why dont you step outside for a few minutes so we can talk this through of course yeah you guys talk but i just want to make sure that you know that my priority is this business okay thats fine todd thank you i want to be a real part of this all right if you could just see that im motivated and ive got connections my uncles got his hookups in prison who i think could be a real help to us if okay that dude wack job  lets just stick to the facts here  facts oh okay how about the fact that he shot a kid a kid that he didnt need to shoot well the boy had seen us and no it didnt look like he knew what he was seeing but what if he told somebody what if he just mentioned it in passing we cant know what someone exactly we cant know because ricky hitler there shot him we us three shouldve had a discussion about it we wouldve figured it out but that dickhead just went ahead and made the choice for us  is that how we do business now  i understand youre upset and what was that crap about his uncle with the prison connections its just some bullshit intimidation move come on its true though he does have some connections  is this a problem  no its nothing to be concerned about it came up in the background i did on him didnt worry me then hes just flexing all right it seems to me that we have three options here and none of which are ideal one we fire todd  yeah  im not a fan of this option seeing that he knows way too much about this business at this point and wed most likely have to pay him to keep quiet and god only knows weve got enough of that going on we dispose of him which leaves us option three we keep him on payroll put him back on tenting houses setting up the lab and so forth we keep him close under our control now option three would be my choice shall we vote i vote three kid youre still in right on thank you so much you guys totally made the right the next time you bring a gun to a job without telling me i will stick it up your ass sideways  you understand  yes sir hey boss whats up i was just in the neighbourhood anything going on no hes just hanging out with his granddaughter well isnt that sweet here let me see its a dead drop  what  a dead drop he just stashed something underneath that trash can write the time down roll on it looks like hes leaving  anybody coming for it  nope not that i can see nobody in sight could be hours could be what do you want to do its not my fault that murthas got his panties in a twist its an hr issue janice i read the report im calling again because thats the wrong case file number all right i dont know what kind of shoddy stan first off miracle whip is not mayonnaise okay looks like it doesnt equal tastes like it secondly every time its like they gotta slather an entire jar bastards screwing with us now howd he make you whatd you do we honked our horns and yelled yoohoo what do you mean what did we do this guy is slippery as hell hes been throwing every tail we put on him  the guys a pro  yeah well even pros make mistakes one of these days our pal ehrmantrauts gonna slip up just gotta be there when he does teenagers sometimes you just want to strangle them hows it going oh you know well this little munchkin i could just keep her forever she is just the sweetest little baby ever born yes she is i dont see much of flynn that car of his keeps him pretty busy yeah more importantly how are you doing im okay hows the therapy i know dave helped me so much when i was going through my little hows your guy  peter  peter hes yeah hes good i feel like im making progress thats great you know you just keep working through it honey babe what is it its okay its all right why dont you let me take holly and then well talk about this  no  okay all right thats fine then how about you just talk to me just tell me whats going on i just i need to make the right decision i need them to be safe the kids theyre safe of course they are i just miss them so much i just want to be with them hey you know we can bring them back home anytime you want no they need to stay but i just i dont know what to do here i like whatever i choose is wrong skyler you gotta tell me whats going on i know sometimes you i know you think i have a big mouth sometimes i but if you felt like you couldnt talk to me i dont know what id do okay so whats this about the kids not being safe safe from what from us from walt and me like what like youre bad parents because youre not not even close marie there are things you just dont know that if you knew youd never speak to me again try me okay if youre not gonna say it i will skyler you have to forgive yourself for ted  what  you cant keep beating yourself up over some stupid little affair  walt told you  please dont blame him i practically forced him to and i wasnt gonna say anything but i cannot stand to watch you torture yourself like this you have to forgive yourself skyler you were having all these problems with walt and ted is a really goodlooking man youre only human hell ive even thought of you know i mean not seriously but i totally get your temptation yeah doesnt it feel good to get it off your chest oh yeah  i feel better  yeah for those who love the taste but not the price theres simulated caviar made of kelp a type of seaweed a fraction of the cost it looks smells and tastes similar to the real thing ready to get back at it unlike fish caviar we have breaking news into our newsroom weve just learned that police are now expanding their search for a missing mckinley county boy after four days with no leads fourteenyearold drew sharp was last seen by his parents thursday morning authorities are extending their search today east from crownpoint to hospah and whitehorse sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike into the desert behind his house investigators are asking any jesse nothing can change this  yeah its just that kids parents  i know believe me i havent been able to sleep the past few nights just thinking about it but jesse now finally were selfsufficient finally we have everything that we need and no one to answer to except ourselves and in a year year and a half once weve cooked through this methylamine and made our money there will be plenty of time for soulsearching until then we keep going and we run our business our way and make sure that this never happens again okay look listen ill finish this up why dont you go on home  you sure  absolutely yeah ill take care of this you go on hey yeah i was just leaving all right hello walter what are you doing here im delivering the batch what are you doing here might as well get this over with come in join us  hey  hi wheres your cars we parked around the block you might consider doing that as well okay so whats going on just since this morning i threw three separate tails all dea  what  the feds have been all over me this has been going on for a while now did they follow you here no i said i threw them i would never come to the headquarters of our illegal meth operation dragging a bunch of cops walter  it would be unwise  how can you be so sure well ive been doing this a long time its pretty basic stuff how long has this been going on since about the time we started this little venture the dea in particular your peach of a brotherinlaw has taken a keen interest in my activities and youre just telling me this now what you didnt think this information would be of interest  wouldnt be germane  ive been handling it walter were sitting on a thousand gallons of stolen methylamine jesus how can you be so irresponsible calm down would you please i cant believe that you kept this from me from us did you know about this  mike just told me  and i said calm down  ive got it under control  oh well forgive me for not having complete confidence  you know this cant go on right  yeah i know and ive already decided im out okay well sorry to see you go mike but i really dont see any other way neither do i obviously jesse youll have to take over the distribution end of things mike i trust that youll bring jesse up to speed on your side of the business yeah about that actually mr white im out too youre what i dont think i can do this anymore so im retiring i guess that methylamine that we stole that we nearly killed ourselves trying to steal that methylamine when cooked is worth nearly  million and youre telling me that youre willing to walk away from that were walking away from the meth not the methylamine jesse and i will be taking our twothirds and selling it ive got a connection a guy i knew from my time with fring this guy has the capital and hes motivated highly mikes thinking well clear like  million each ill pay off my guys in lockup out of my share and those legacy costs youre so fond of you wont have to worry about anymore and then i will be going on my way jesse too its a solid plan you can come in on this with us thatd be cool course you know you are free to hold onto your third and keep cooking youll be selling to my competitors this guy and his crew are way out in phoenix its a big country walter whole lot of methheads pennies on the dollar jesse and thats what youre gonna sell out for pennies why five million isnt pennies its more money than ive ever seen and when it comes down to it are we in the meth business or the money business relax kid theres no one there you sure i wouldnt be here if i wasnt glad to see you could make it out i was surprised to get your call good surprise i hope theres one gallon as discussed you take that back home to your people test it if youre satisfied i can get the other  all right thats fair enough shall we talk money that ones free the price for the rest is  per six hundred and sixtyfive gallons thats  although i would prefer you round it up to  makes it easier for my partner and i to split steep we good ill talk to my guys but i should be able to put together that cash yeah good i gotta tell you this is worth it just to get that blue stuff of yours off the market the blue stuff will be off the market right now this whole time i was thinking  that seems like an odd number twothirds of an even thousand though when i look at it that way it starts to make sense to me thats not all the methylamine is it you two have a partner you havent mentioned this other party wouldnt be a problem for you  his territory wont impact yours  you see that doesnt work for me im not just buying this for the supply im buying this for the demand im looking to increase my market share well i dont know what to tell you i want you to tell me that frings blue will be off the streets all right heres a new deal for you then ill pay you k a gallon for the full thousand gallons not a drop less its not mine to sell declan well then no deal mike yes yes i guess i dont know why dont you come over here to my house yes seriously hey yo you sure this is okay shes not here nobodys here all right so somethings come up mike wanted to come here to give you the hard sell but i figured itd be better coming from me mikes connection wont buy mine and mikes shares of the methylamine unless he gets your share too he wants the entire thousand gallons absolutely not yeah i figured youd say that but ive been thinking about it and it really makes sense  kind of  it does does it look when you started this thing did you ever dream of having  million i know for a fact that you didnt i know for a fact all you needed was  because you worked it all out like mathematically look if selling the methylamine now means that no one else ever gets killed then i vote for that man hands down and we could have it tomorrow we would be out spend time with your family no more worrying about them getting hurt or finding out about everything isnt this what youve been working for i have not been working this hard just to sell out  its not selling out  yes it is jesse i have we have suffered and bled literally for this business and i will not throw it away for nothing i dont know how else to say it mr white five million dollars isnt nothing jesse have you heard of a company called gray matter  no  well i cofounded it in grad school with a couple of friends of mine actually i was the one who named it and back then it was just oh it was just smalltime we had a couple patents pending but nothing earthshattering course we all knew the potential yeah we were gonna take the world by storm and then this well something happened between the three of us and im not gonna go into detail but for personal reasons i decided to leave the company and i sold my share to my two partners i took a buyout for  now at the time that was a lot of money for me care to guess what that company is worth now millions billions with a b twopointonesix billion as of last friday i look it up every week and i sold my share my potential for  i sold my kids birthright for a few months rent this isnt the same thing jesse you asked me if i was in the meth business or the money business neither im in the empire business i dont know mr white is a meth empire really something to be that proud of skyler you remember jesse jesse this is my wife skyler hey mrs white good to see you you have a lovely home  i was just heading out  why dont you stay for dinner  no mr white im gonna go  stay come on itll be fun its okay with us isnt it skyler we dont have anything special planned tonight yeah sure why not see these are great green beans mrs white i like that you got the slivered almonds going my mom always made them like that you put lemon in there too they are from the deli at albertsons well you know good work on your shopping then because these are choice i eat a lot of frozen stuff its usually pretty bad i mean the pictures are always so awesome you know its like hell yeah im stoked for this lasagna and then you nuke it and the cheese gets all scabby on top and its like youre eating a scab i mean seriously whats that about its like yo whatever happened to truth in advertising you know yeah its bad so hey hows business the car wash mr white said its going really well says like youre a great manager he did huh yeah he says youve got it running like a like a machine like welloiled yeah what else did he tell you about me oh you know just good stuff just really you know really good good stuff we dont really talk that much about you know personal things did you also tell him about my affair may i please be excused you know my kids are gone thank god no i dont mean theyre out for the night theyre gone theyre staying with my inlaws she made me kick my own kids out of the house she told me that she was counting the days until my cancer came back my wife is waiting for me to die this business is all i have left now its all i have and you want to take it away from me i thought you might try something stupid  look mike  dont bother walter come join me in the office i dont think so thats not a request might as well get comfortable this deals going down tomorrow its happening and theres nothing you can do to stop it  got it  so its okay for you to steal my to ensure that you and i are gonna spend the rest of the night together in this office  like its my birthday  mike when the deal is done youll get your money i guarantee that let me cook it ill double your five and you still walk you know i have never seen anybody work so hard not to get  million mike you need to listen to me no walter the last thing i need to do is listen to you now sit down all right walter ive got a bit of a quandary here ive got something i need to attend to before this deal happens but for some reason i dont trust you alone with the methylamine im gonna have to restrain you you gotta be kidding stand up for me please stand up turn around for me arms out to the side up  oh man  sit down sit down give me your wrist sorry alrighty to what do we owe the pleasure well gentlemen were here to discuss your illegal harassment of my client this should be good mr ehrmantraut has become the subject of a vicious relentless and unwarranted dea persecution  gomie does that sound right to you  i have no idea what hes talking about play it as cool as you like fonzie but we all know youve been following my client day and night the man cant spend a few minutes with his granddaughter without you guys quivering in the bushes and peeping through your binoculars its well its disturbing and its taken a toll on his mental and physical wellbeing your client looks fine to me well some hurts only show on the inside now you guys dont even have warrants for these tails do you theoretically these tails you refer to would be within the bounds of the law we dont need a warrant to follow somebody through a public place  theoretically  yeah that is theoretically correct however i would counter that an openended unrestricted surveillance like this amounts to stalking which is illegal now i dont know what it is you find so interesting about my client and im not here to judge different strokes and all but sadly hes just not that into you so i have filed for a temporary restraining order against the dea on behalf of mr ehrmantraut whered you get your law degree goodman the same clown college you got that suit you know who likes this suit judge papadoumian she thinks im a snappy dresser you know what judge papadoumian hates police harassment of a senior citizen sorry expect a visit from the sheriff agents you should have your ex parte within the hour lets go what kind ofjudge would issue this thing papadoumian man shes like ho chi minh so what do we do well not a lot of choice you know we back off for the moment tro wont stand up and goodman knows it i dont see what theyre playing at here but if ehrmantraut wants a fight  hes gonna get one  all right  that was a hell of a gamble  worked yeah well not for long and hes right about that tro its gonna get tossed tout de suite meanwhile schraders hardon for you just reached uncle miltie proportions so have fun with that how much time i got maybe  hours its enough it better be whatever you got planned you best pull the ripcord while you still have a chance  where is it  mike  mike  get out of my way you sit down  mike mike hold on okay  i am gonna count to three mr whites got an idea mike im serious  one two  its a great idea look you get your  million we both do and he gets his methylamine all right just hear him out is that true walter everybody wins  there thats them your play walter youre on your own looks like youre about  gallons light here mike wheres the juice the methylamine isnt coming why is that  and who the hell are you  im the man whos keeping it what the hells this we had an agreement right we got our deal so wheres the tank mike mike doesnt know where it is only i do and youre dealing with me now not him why dont you just cut to what it is you want or what you think is gonna happen here all right because were gonna get what we came for that  gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands than it is in yours or anyone elses for that matter but i need distribution distribution thats right so if you agree to give up your cook and sell my product instead ill give you  percent of the take thirtyfive percent wow are you kidding me thirtyfive mike please tell me this is a joke know how far we had to stick our necks out to get our hands on this cash why the hell would we want you you know we have our own operation right i know all about your operation see my partners here tell me that you produce a meth thats  percent pure if youre lucky what i produce is  percent pure so so its grade school tball versus the new york yankees yours is just some tepid offbrand generic cola what im making is classic coke all right okay so if we just waste you right here right now and leave you in the desert then there is no more coke on the market right see how that works theres only us do you really wanna live in a world without cocacola my partner tells me that your crew switched to a pp cook because of our success you dye your meth with food colouring to make it look like mine you already ape my product at every turn but now you have the opportunity to sell it yourself i need you to listen to me were not gonna give up this deal to be your errand boys do you understand for what to watch a bunch of junkies get a better high a better high means customers pay more a higher purity means a greater yield thats  million dollars of profit that isnt being pissed away by some substandard cook now you listen to me youve got the greatest meth cook in a no the two greatest meth cooks in america right here and with our skills youll earn more from that  percent than you ever would on your own yeah so you say just wondering why were so lucky why cut us in mike is retiring from our crew so his share of the partnership is available if you can handle his end distribution and if you give him  million dollars of the  million that you brought today just think of it as a finders fee for bringing us together we have  pounds of product ready to ship ready to go are you ready who the hell are you you know you all know exactly who i am say my name do what i dont have a damn clue who the hell you are yeah you do im the cook im the man who killed gus fring bullshit cartel got fring are you sure thats right now say my name youre heisenberg youre goddamn right i gotta hand it to you walter hey i appreciate the kind words but im out too remember i know well talk maybe we should talk about how and when im gonna get my  million dollars and we will do that absolutely its just you know look jesse just give me some time here okay ill need help getting things up and running during this transition you can at least do that for me right come on dont worry well figure it out well i guess thats it parting thoughts of which i have two first as i said ill handle the legacy costs out of my end so you wont have to worry about my guys anymore second the bug the dea will do a sweep cant say when could be anytime but you need to get it out of there sooner rather than later all right thats it no thanks

look out for yourself  are we good  you tell me okay jesse back it up youre good keep it coming straight back slow it down all right thats good hey mrs white vamonos i wish all right lets get this

ill bet you  tell the wagon boys they can have him  yes when i found him he was he was dead hey perfect timing just about to get started you know if you can get going on that settling tank that would be a huge help we left that stuff in there too long after the last cook  mr white  i mean way too long now we have a tremendous amount of residue you know what we need to invest in is a power washer mr white can we just take a second and talk about all this yeah yeah sure yeah look you know what i think we need to talk about is doubling down doubling down cooking  pounds a week not  as in starting a new lab a lab that youll run a cook all of your own why not you deserve it youre every bit as good as me well what do you think mr white i think that nothing has changed for me i just wanna get my money and get out jesse this what we do being the best at something is a very rare thing you dont just toss something like that away and what you wanna squander that potential your potential why to do what  i dont know  well think to do what jesse ill ill figure it out all right look at you what have you got in your life huh nothing nobody oh wait yes  video games and gocarts  mr w and when you get tired of that what then and how soon will you start using again look look i know how upset you are about what happened to this boy i am just as upset as you are are you really how can you say that to me jesus i mean im the one whos the father here what do i have to curl up in a ball in tears in front of you do i have to lock myself away in a room and get high to prove it to you what happened to that boy is a tragedy and it tears me up inside but because it happened what am i supposed to just lie down and die with him its done it makes me sick that it happened just like everyone else who has died in our wake what todd did you and i have done things that are just as bad yeah all the people that weve killed gale and the rest if you believe that theres a hell i dont know if youre into that but were already pretty much going there right but im not gonna lie down until i get there what just because i dont wanna cook meth anymore im lying down how many more people are gonna die because of us no one none now that were in control no one else gets hurt you keep saying that and its bullshit every time  no  always you know what im done okay you just give me my money and you and i were done okay why why do you want this money because its mine its my cut but isnt it filthy blood money i mean youre so pure you have such emotional depth no no no you shouldnt touch that dirty money ill save you from that jesse come on you want it you want it just as much as i want it and its not wrong to want it okay so stay and work with me and you can make ten ti twenty times as much whatever man you dont wanna pay me i dont care  yes you do  its on you all right  im done  no youre not youre not done youre not leaving because if you leave you get nothing do you understand me nothing jesse budget for the current fiscal year for electronic surveillance is  million on par with atf and the marshal service but still just a fraction of fbi totals were lobbying congress for an additional  but were waiting on action reports to demonstrate were actually getting worthwhile results our undercover operations reap the most successful actionable intelligence if you refer to the chart in appendix  if asac schrader can tell us about the surveillance manhours hank hank hank i think were going to wrap this up if asac schrader can stay behind while everyone else clears out thank you everybody you know no one wants to see you succeed at this more than me right  yes sir  i know how good you are i wouldnt have stuck my neck out to get you here if i didnt but youre not knocking down doors anymore bubba youre in charge of a district office and that comes with responsibilities i mean hank basic reports arent being filed in a timely manner ill work on it itll get better yeah it will because way too much time and money is being spent on the fring case a case which is essentially over all this overtime to surveil michael ehrmantraut thats just money that could be better spent elsewhere i understand but im not making these choices lightly weve got increased reports of blue meth on the street frings gang is still operational and ehrmantraut is involved its that simple i believe you but so what its one case out of dozens and you dont play favourites  with it because it used to be yours  i really think dont play favourites you got a biggerjob than that i mean forget the financial cost i hear youre personally serving search warrants out in the field that was an error in judgement wont happen again youre damn right it wont im just gonna bottomline this for you the surveillance budget for ehrmantraut is now zero we clear sure thank you  clear  good well be in touch yeah  hey  hey so ramey wanted to catch up with you talk sports and stuff i guess yeah something like that no more following ehrmantraut not worth the financial investment well its not like the guys going anywhere hes not even bothering to throw our tails anymore hes just living a boring oldman life like he has nothing left to hide  and none of frings crew is talking  not giving an inch you sweeten the pot enough zero jail time and an allexpensepaid trip to maui not that but close nobody wants to bite christ theyre either the most loyal crew in history or someones paying them off  you still checking bank records  no one living beyond their means nine perps all being represented by one lawyer not unusual in a case like this yeah this guy whats his name daniel wachsberger he represents every one of these douche bags except for ehrmantraut can we find out more about the lawyer you want me to start tailing a lawyer like the shit aint deep enough for you already ramey said we couldnt follow ehrmantraut he didnt say anything about anybody else do it youre the boss all right shall we get started now i know that most of this or all of this is gonna be new to you but did you take chemistry in high school just basic no okay thats all right as we go ill be as detailed as possible without being overwhelming yes sir look todd i dont need you to be antoine lavoisier what i do need is your full effort and attention listen and apply yourself if you do that then we just might have a fighting chance here okay  okay  okay well here we go slowly steady the aluminium helps speed up the delivery of hydrogen chloride gently pour it in dont spill it youre gonna like the little schticky but youre gonna love the big schticky for bigger messes like dust bunnies now the co freezes the liquid crystallising it which gives us our finished methamphetamine now all thats left is to break it up weigh it and were done wow this is this is complicated its gonna take me a few more times to get a grasp on it oh yeah itll take a few more times i do all right you did fine todd you applied yourself thats as much as i can ask now all thats left i guess is to talk money we can talk money once i get this right morning guess what i have cake pops theyre balls of cake on a stick very nice thank you dan see i put little faces on them hey hey all right im working with a new guy now and i think that it i think it could possibly work out because im trying hank i really am im trying but theres theres i mean its like i dont even exist to her well yeah yeah i mean i know shes struggling i know but i just dont know what to do i mean what can i do such a mess i mean we both of us we just

yeah  look im sorry to waste your time  with all this  no  its you know but its you know  yeah  hey  oh hey hey could you excuse me oh yeah yeah yeah sure sure  tell me something good  you tell me sweated the guy for  hours that should be some kind of record quit your bragging whatd you get hes gonna do it hes gonna flip hes willing to give us ehrmantraut what are you wasting your time for throw a net around that son of a bitch all right  yeah  mike hey its me  can you talk  i can great look theres a small situation with the money i dont wanna do this on the phone are you available i

mike theyre coming for you  right now theyre coming  slow down walter who the dea the dea somebody flipped they have some kind of bank surveillance and something about some lawyer someone is talking mike and theyre coming for you right now how could mike use that clown of a lawyer dan wachsberger he wouldve had better luck with the law firm of moe larry and shemp always consult with me before using outside counsel all right saul enough please instead of just sitting around here  what can we do  besides pray that he gets away im open to ideas because if the dea catches up with him and he flips its good night johnboy no no way mike would ever flip okay no way yeah yeah never say never this is the second time the dea has confiscated his bankroll you know jesus fool me once right look he wont flip but his nine guys will hey its him mike i got you on speaker phone with the brain trust  the what  the walt and jesse are here i dont want walt and jesse saul i want you i need your help  what do you need  i got a gobag at the airport passports money but there are eyes everywhere i cant get close i need you to pick up that bag and get it to me as soon as possible do you know how thick the crap storm is out there told you not to use that lawyer hes a hack  shut up saul and get the bag  hey mike i can get it to you all right  just tell me what to do  no kid not you im paying saul he can do the job just fine yeah youre paying me and the dea knows i represent you so theyre probably sitting on my car right now hoping i do something stupid mike i can do it okay its not a problem  no jesse  jesus ill do it besides youre out remember mike tell me where to get this bag hello walter before i hand this over i need something from you  and whats that  the names of your nine men why youre never gonna pay them off whats the point the point is mike it affects me it affects jesse too and we deserve to know the only thing left to do now is leave town you understand leave town yeah i just cant up and leave like you mike ive got a family ive got people who depend on me yeah goodbye walter youre welcome im sorry what i want those names mike you owe me that much i dont owe you a damn thing all of this falling apart like this is on you oh thats some kind of logic right there mike you screw up get yourself followed by the dea and now suddenly this is all my fault  why dont you walk me through this  we had a good thing you stupid son of a bitch we had fring we had a lab we had everything we needed and it all ran like clockwork  oh my god  you couldve shut your mouth cooked and made as much money as you ever needed it was perfect but no you just had to blow it up you and your pride and your ego you just had to be the man if youd done your job known your place wed all be fine right now i just i just realised that lydia has the names i can get them from her im sorry mike this this whole thing couldve been avoided shut the fuck up and let me die in peace  mr white hello mr white the cars been dealt with sir no one tailed you no i stayed off the main streets and kept checking so joe ask any questions i told him rv job just like you said and he totally knew its pretty cool the way they do that they just turn a car into a cube so should we deal with this other thing now yeah sure  i dont want to talk about this  okay it had to be done okay all right i need to talk to you in private so whats the story you get to mike he get out safe hes gone all right well what about those nine guys in jail i mean they got no reason not to talk now so what do we do we whos we there is no we jesse im the only vote left and ill handle it my client will supply information relating to the organisation distribution and production of frings methamphetamine enterprise we expect all charges to be dropped and dennis not only walks out of here a free man but also receives blanket immunity for what hell be furnishing this deal is plenty fair best id be willing to do is queen for a day and reduced charges all charges dropped queen for a day and a fivek thats the best youre gonna get no way guys come on you can be a fairy princess for all i care where you going shopping for someone who can tell me something i dont already know hey hey i got plenty you dont know you seem a little confused this here is a buyers market i got eight other assholes just like you four of them within  feet from here i also got dan the lawyer wholl give me the money and ehrmantraut so settle in dennis enjoy your new home im gonna go rattle some cages  so  maybe you should order something  do you want a coffee or something  not just now i think this would play better if you ordered something i think this will play just fine and im not thirsty so lets take a look at the list lydia youve come all this way you do have the list  yes i have it  good its just not written down  and why is that  its in my head safer there i see then i suggest you pick up a pen not just yet it was my understanding that attending to these nine names was precisely what you wanted ten names now ten counting the lawyer yes ten counting the lawyer so what am i not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit youre tying up loose ends and i dont wanna be one of them i give you that list ive served my purpose then maybe im just one more person who knows too much so you put that list in my hands and in your mind i immediately just murder you just right here in this restaurant  no not right here of course  here in this public place immediately  that is not  listen lydia you made me promise on my childrens lives that i guaranteed your safety from mike you guaranteed id be safe from mike theres no way hed ever go for this you getting rid of his guys you wouldnt be doing this the names if mike were still a factor yeah thats what i thought what do you want exactly because if you dont want to give me that list then ive truly got no use for you i can grow your business exponentially just give me the list i can do that by helping you expand into a larger highly active highly profitable marketplace what do you know about the czech republic the czech republic did you know theres a higher demand for meth there than anywhere in europe five percent of its  million people which is roughly the population of the southwest from western texas to phoenix are using meth you keep your market here but by adding overseas sales you can more than double your current profits and i checked the average purity is only about  percent theyve never seen anything like your product youll blow their hair back shipping internationally seems like courting disaster not if youre madrigal madrigal is under investigation by the dea the restaurant division mostly weve got  employees spread across  divisions and once mikes people are no longer a factor things should tidy up nicely this is what i do you understand move things from point a to point b all over the globe onepointtwo million metric tons a month and all of it right at my fingertips a laptop click away the czech republic  whos on the other end  people i ship to regularly people ive worked with for years professional and very amenable im very careful who i work with and if this is such a slam dunk then why didnt you pitch it to fring i did he said yes we were in the final stages of working it out when somebody killed him you dont think gus fring built his distribution network all by himself there are considerable advantages to diversification of distribution like putting  miles between you and your product at  pounds a week im estimating youll gross about  million give me  pounds to start and well see how it goes  all right  now with fring my end was gonna be  percent which i believe is more than fair  okay  trust me if you do this lydia learn to take yes for an answer now first things first shake on it were going to make a lot of money together todd i think its time i meet your uncle no iron pile theres too many muscleheads flexing their shit too many eyes okay so no chow line no yard well gonna keep it simple passbyes yeah hallways shower room cells the easy stuff i say we go with a riot our boys get it done in a riot no no no no chaos i dont want the goon squad rolling in and stealing our shot you know this has gotta be fast and quiet just boom boom boom  you know what im saying  yeah surgical surgical thats what its gotta be so how many guys we got at mdc three counting shattuck and he makes the schedule now so we can put who we need where we need them all right so mdcs covered what about the rest we need g block in valencia right our guys on the night shift  have him pull a double  no his supervisors got some hardon about ot have him switch with somebody just get it done regardless you know we got enough guys in valencia right now might have to hire out you high mix blood with chuntaros  no way  no theres no need we got enough hitters aint the problem its that short walking window after lunch yeah its gonna be tight real tight i gotta be straight with you man taking out all these guys is doable but hitting them in three separate jails all within two minutes i mean whacking bin laden wasnt this complicated where do you suppose these come from ive seen this one before i wonder are they all in some giant warehouse someplace hey it can be done just not the way you want it it can be done exactly how i want it the only question is are you the man to do it figure it out thats what im paying you for yo whats going on man whats that alarm whats happening what are you doing man no man please no man help me help me help help me ball came in my direction batter wouldnt even bother running excuse me a second couple more photos yes its done new details have emerged in the spate of jail deaths  that rocked central new mexico three days ago as of yet no names of victims have been released  but authorities continue to investigate what appears to be  a carefully coordinated sequence of attacks  that occurred within minutes in three different correctional facilities  is it okay if i turn this off  oh sure i dont want the news on right now hank just pulled up

hike in pick up where i left off oh it sounds nice being out in the woods all day no it wasnt so great i got sunburned there were mosquitoes i just wanted to make a few bucks buy beer been thinking about that job more and more lately maybe i shouldve enjoyed it more tagging trees is a lot better than chasing monsters i used to love to go camping  this way  here baby girl come see your brother

to say kid but youre still gonna be two miracles short of sainthood brass tacks okay my job is to advise and my advice is come on already mike left one step ahead of the boys in blue you better believe his familys on the radar a couple million bucks shows up theyre gonna snatch it the feds have already taken kaylees money twice what are you going for a hat trick ill freaking do it myself saul no no no i was just thinking out loud enough bullshit saul are you gonna do this or not yes yes absolutely i live to serve and kid you might wanna think about cleaning up a little getting some

i think you know that i dont know that i dont listen to me i did not kill mike the last time that i saw him he had his bag the one that i brought him and he got into his car and he drove away and for all i know hes alive and well and if if he does come back and he doesnt understand why i had to do what i did well then thats on me jesse i need you to believe this its not true its just not so hes out there hes okay yes mike is fine wherever he is we both know that he can take care of himself and hes certainly capable to provide for his own family okay jesse i need you to believe me yeah like you said hes alive yeah mikes alive absolutely youve got to have a counselor are they bringing in someone new i dont know um maybe shell be back what if shes not what are you supposed to do whats

hey did you have any of that potato salad i dont know maybe maybe yeah i mean no one else got sick so i probably shouldnt worry about it well skyler will be very happy to hear that youre feeling better which reminds me i better get back to it if theres anything i can do feel better you know youre gonna laugh but i have to ask you about this believe it or not i found this on my car i mean it looks just like the gps tracker that we used on gus fring doesnt it back when we were tracking him just the two of us you wouldnt know anything about this would you hank you okay i gotta say i dont like the way youre looking at me right now it was you all along it was you you son of a bitch you drove into traffic to keep me from that laundry calm down that call i got telling me marie was in the hospital that wasnt pinkman you had my cell number you killed  witnesses to save your sorry ass listen to me you bombed a nursing home heisenberg heisenberg you lying twofaced sack of shit hank look i dont know where this is coming from hank but just i swear to christ i will put you under the jail take a breath okay listen to yourself these wild accusations they could destroy our family and for what you dont give a shit about family hank my cancer is back good rot you son of a bitch im sorry you feel that way i wanna beat this thing i do im back on chemo and i am fighting like hell but the truth is in six months you wont have someone to prosecute but even even if somehow you were able to convince anyone that i was capable of doing these things you and i both know i would never see the inside of a jail cell im a dying man who runs a car wash my right hand to god that is all that i am whats the point have skyler bring the kids here and then well talk that is not going to happen i dont know who you are i dont even know who im talking to if thats true if you dont know who i am then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly  mariano its me i need you to get skyler on the line no no i need you to get her on the phone right now tell her its urgent no what do you mean she wont get off the phone i am giving you permission mariano you make her get off the phone mariano who is skyler on the phone with yeah okay where is she wheres skyler she just kind of left she didnt say where she was going skyler my my head is spinning and yours i i cant even imagine so much makes sense to me now you jumping in the pool you sending us your kids i get it i just wished id seen it sooner hes a monster hes a look i dont know what he did to you to force you to keep his secrets if he threatened you or whatever mind games he played i dont know if there was abuse but i want you to know that you can be open with me dont hold anything back okay i mean i dont even understand if you know the full extent of this what hes done not just the meth cooking but the lives hes destroyed but look thats all behind you starting now youre done being his victim because heres what were gonna do sky heres what were gonna do you and the kids will move back to our house where youll be safe where he cant get to you hank does marie no well get to that soon enough its just you and me right now okay okay before we um before we get you back to the house i im gonna ask you to tell me everything you can um take as long as you like just start from the beginning when you first became aware of walts activities and just try to be as detailed as you can what right right here right now sure why not while its still fresh you know and just remember to state your name and the date before you start hank do do we have to do this right now no we dont have to do this right now no heres the thing i need something solid that i can bring to my people a statement on the record so you testifying to walts criminal activity whatever you know goes a long long way here okay i mean you see building a case this big gathering evidence enough to get a conviction were talking a longhaul proposition i dont want that bastard running out the clock but with your testimony what do you mean running out the clock his cancer his cancer is back so he says he didnt tell you whos to say its even true lying piece of shit look regardless i mean well just assume fine okay that son of a bitch looks me in the eye and he says if what i know is true if hell be dead before i can prove it the balls on that son of a i got all these little pieces theyre all part of the story they dont mean much on their own but when you tell me what you know we start filling in the gaps ill have him in lockup before the sun goes down hank i i think maybe maybe i need a lawyer what no no no you dont yeah i think maybe i do skyler understand i am here to help you but to do that i need your help we start bringing in lawyers and they start putting up roadblocks where they dont need to be and my ability to control this situation diminishes just for my own protection and just you know it seems to make sense that i should have someone to talk to skyler im your biggest advocate here and im telling you for your own good you need to get out ahead of this thing i mean you start you know getting defensive im not saying its right but ill tell you its a fact the da will look at you differently but you dont know that skyler yes i do ive been around long enough to know its in your best interest to get out there and show the world you have nothing to hide look no one in the world is more important to me than your sister so believe me when i tell you that your best interests and mine are the same but hank you telling me not to talk to a lawyer doesnt sound like that at all it sounds like what you want what you want is to get walt at all costs okay okay lets just slow down slow down you can you can talk to a lawyer later but right now what we need to do we need to go get the kids we need to bring them to my house so that theyre safe and then we need to help each other put that animal away okay come on hank lets go to the house and well deal with it there am i under arrest what am i under arrest skyler i youre not thinking straight about this you have to listen to me i skyler skyler skyler am i under arrest no am i under arrest no sky hank are you arresting me sky am i under arrest jesus mary and joseph i gotta do it man dude mm what are you doing huell hey quit screwing around mm we are here to do a job not channel scrooge mcduck you hearing me i hear you dude aw screw it mexico alls im saying guy hit  guys in jail within a twominute window alls im saying yeah its me again listen youve got to hide those bags the monkey is in the banana patch capiche so call me thats the third message where the hell is that kid thats her dont i have to talk to her you dont answer that phone and schraders on the line with a wiretap recording everything youre not doing anybody any favors why do you still have a battery in that thing take it out they might be trying to triangulate your movements im not being paranoid do it i cant believe she went to him she just panicked she went right to him without even talking to me im not saying its not bad its bad but it could be worse really how much worse could it be exactly in your estimation what does she actually know what has she seen hm nothing its hearsay its all he said she said the only real evidence that she can lead them to is your money once we take care of that well yeah then they got nothing nothing hank knows thats not nothing yeah i cant exactly see him turning the other cheek of course theres always um always what have you given any thought to um sending him on a trip to belize belize yeah belize you know where uh where mike went to off on a trip to uh belize saul you better not be saying what i think youre saying its just conjecture on my part hank is family okay its an option that you understand that its an option that has worked well for you in the past jesus what is wrong with you my mistake family off limits of course im just throwing thoughts out there this is a safe room right jesus send him to belize ill send you to belize finally its about time have you two been followed are you sure if they had wed all be in handcuffs right now i took the tops off figured youd wanna check to make sure its all there you figured right close enough if you need any help on the other end these things are a bitch to move ill manage and we dont mind overtime aint no thing pay huell and kuby and take your cut the rest is mine insurance in case i need you in case you need me im thinking the probability is high just find jesse keys saul

about walter jr flynn and holly should be living with us end of story and while we respect your opinion we think that your concern is misplaced skyler and i feel due to maries attempt to lure him to your house i wasnt trying to lure him regardless of what you might call it skyler and i would like to ask you to please leave our children out of this junior has been through a lot already this year you are just this investigation hank do you realize what this will do to him hearing these things hes gonna hear it when i kick in your front door and arrest you if that day ever comes so be it you have no evidence to support your claims why tear this family apart so how about that guacamole we make it right here at the table ill just give you guys a few more minutes how can you sit there and

back look whatever you think he did this is not an ongoing situation skyler no they need to understand its in the past its over there is nothing to go after here theres nothing to accomplish how can we believe anything you say theres no telling where the lies begin and end that affair of yours did that even happen please look junior just found out that my cancer is back hes already facing the idea of living without his father to put this on top of that its just not right i swear to god you start throwing the word right at me what i mean was it right to run a drug empire there is no drug empire lying to your son to all of us is that right what do i have to do to make you believe me why dont you kill yourself walt  what  just kill yourself this whole thing dies with you thats what youre saying here is that hank should just let it go and wait for you to die well maybe you should just go ahead and die then that is not a solution no its not a solution hes not getting off that easy jesus hank and the same goes for you if you stick with him both of you think youre just gonna walk away from this thing never gonna happen that is not what were saying enough with the bullshit youre not gonna negotiate your way out of this thing theres only one solution step up be a man and admit what youve done thats it there is no other option lets go my name is walter hartwell white i live at  negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico  this is my confession if youre watching this tape im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my th birthday he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought hank was a very moral man and i was particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ridealong and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed hank had a partner a businessman named gustavo fring hank sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didnt know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on hank it failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over   upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring the bomb that he used was built by me he gave me no option in that i have often contemplated suicide but im a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen to become the head of the albuquerque dea to keep me in line he took my children for three months he kept them my wife had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit and in response he gave me this i cant take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family all i could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is who do you think hes shown this to no one its a threat its what he will do if i dont back off i think you should show this to ramey just get ahead of it that video is a bunch of lies hank anybody who knows you will know a hundred and seventyseven thousand dollars hell is he talking about marie they told me it was gambling money what was gambling money oh jesus christ marie oh god no how was i supposed to know how was i to know where it came from why were they paying for my bills what about my insurance insurance wouldnt have covered the treatment you needed and i i wanted the best for you why didnt you tell me because i knew that you would refuse it and without it you may never have been able to walk again oh christ marie you killed me here i mean its the its the last nail thats the last nail in the coffin what do we do if i were you id be more nervous ugh jesus its always the desert

that areas still pretty bad right well have to go over this a lot more weve made three passes already like i say gasolines tricky no no no the smell has got to be gone completely my wife is coming home and i cant have any odor any stain any sign that anything happened here understand i i know this is short notice and i really appreciate it sir wed love to take more of your money but youve got gas soaked through to your subfloor until you pull this up and get new carpet new padding this is as good as it gets is that gasoline ask dad hey over here what happened what happened is that i should sue someone thats what happened so im on my way to the drugstore and i have to stop to get some gas and there is this total pump malfunction you know what she shouldnt be in this room i mean this is supposedly green but you know how it is you can close the windows in the nursery because its really only out here this is as good as it gets so uh pump malfunction yeah im standing there filling up like ive done a thousand times and i hear a chunk you know the pumps nozzle the metal thing the thing you squeeze i hear a chunk so i suppose in my naivet√£ i took to understand that gas is no longer coming out of the nozzle so i pull out the hose to put it back and whoosh yeah i am suddenly soaked in gasoline i mean on my arms and my legs and my groin so now i am in a panic i race home i run inside the house and im stripping off my clothes as fast as i can i jump in the shower its not until after i get out of the shower that i realize my gascovered clothes have been soaking in the living room rug this entire time i mean its its the whole thing is just so stupid i could have rinsed off at the station halfway home i started to realize wait a minute theres a water hose right there next to the air pump you know for tires anyway so that was my day how was yours dad yeah please can you just tell the truth tell what do you mean you fainted didnt you because youre sick again you were pumping gas and the fumes they made you pass out again just just admit it no the no it was the pump all right i maybe i did get a little swimmy at one point but i did not faint okay im fine and thats the truth however in the best interest of all of our continued good health i dont think we can stay here i mean not until we get new carpet yeah uncle hank and aunt marie they got plenty of space hey what about a hotel a hotel that could be sweet a good one i like the way youre thinking yes could be a little family vacation might be fun what do you say why dont you put some clothes together yeah all right im sorry its not my finest hour ill go pack a bag okay okay think thisll leave a scar i never should have let my dojo membership run out jesus jesse did that yeah but you gotta understand deep down he loves me so where is he still looking where have you looked his place his folks place this brock kids place crack shacks at siesta hills the indigo the crystal palace gokart joint on copper ave aa meeting off the  his buddies beaver and whatshisname badger and skinny pete yeah no hes not with them they could be covering for him i posed as a meter reader i put a bug on the tall kids moms place for three hours straight all he talked about was something called babylon  i checked with my gal at apd pinkmans not in their system so the cops dont have him yet maybe he changed his mind about leaving called your guy back somebody misses their first chance with my guy theres no second well keep looking what then what do you mean i mean pinkmans like a bad penny sooner or later hell turn up im wondering what you wanna do when he does jesse is upset about the boy i just need to explain to him why that had to happen okay but say you know just for the sake of argument the kids not in the mood for a nuanced discussion of the virtues of child poisoning his plans are running more towards stabbing you to death with a pointed stick in that scenario then what you have a suggestion we were wondering if maybe this isnt an old yeller type situation old yeller yeah old yeller was the best most loyal dog there ever was i mean everybody loved that mutt but one day he showed up rabid and little timmy for old yellers own sake had to uh oh you you saw the movie youre full of colorful metaphors arent you saul belize old yeller just brimming with advice do not float that idea again find him sorry ah sorry room key wouldnt let me into the ice room so i had to go down to the front desk but here we are checked in on junior heh payperview and room service hes in heaven hey i thought you were gonna take a bath hows saul doing saul goodman no idea no you were just out talking to him in the parking lot im sorry were you spying on me yes and i feel just awful about it too you know i played along with your pump malfunction bullshit because junior was standing right there but now i would like to know whats going on first of all its no big deal coming here is just me being overly cautious jesse pinkman you know he came over to our house that time for dinner remember well he he got upset over this something he thinks i did i did do it but i did it for very good reasons and its just its complicated wait are you are you telling me that he tried to burn our house down that was probably for a brief moment his intention but obviously he changed his mind and how does that work him him changing his mind ah god look youve got to understand that with jesse there are emotional issues personal issues some drug abuse but he has always been more of a danger to himself than anyone else he has a tendency to fly off the handle thats all so he has never hurt anybody no i cant believe you got her down so fast so whats your course of action here sauls guy kuby tracks him down which shouldnt take long and when he does im gonna im gonna talk to him make him see reason talk to him make him see reason so im clear these are just euphemisms youre using here right no what wh what does that mean my god i knew this was going to happen i knew it i told you that someday someone was going to come to our door and try to hurt us and now here we are no jesse didnt go there to hurt anyone he poured gasoline all over our house walt he tried to set our house on fire he changed his mind he didnt do it did he what if he changes it back walt you need to deal with this how much have you had to drink heh heh not nearly enough i dont know how we got off on whatever it is were talking about here but clearly i havent explained the situation well enough because this is a big overreaction we all need to just take a deep breath and calm down because jesse isnt just some some some rabid dog this is a person a person that is a threat to us i mean my god where we are now with hank and marie and that awful tape we made after everything weve done you cant just talk to this person youre saying that i just what what exactly are you saying weve come this far for us whats one more jesse stop what youre doing and turn and face me you wanna you wanna know what he did you wanna hear about it jesse put out the lighter he poisoned a little kid an yearold boy just because you know just as a move walts a bastard secrets out well talk about it but i need you to put out the lighter okay look jesse jesse i dont wanna kill you and you dont wanna be killed so put it out he

paralysis that leaves the victim conscious through a progression of symptoms death occurs from respiratory failure that is definitely a contender marie youre not ready to fill me in here thats fine

improved and congratulations todd but blue is our brand all over europe its what our buyers pay top dollar for if were down a bit in purity from the heisenberg days maybe theyll let us slide on that

of time before you end up like this oh man oh man i swear to god i didnt know he was gonna kill him man i didnt know he was gonna kill him relax if we thought you did youd be in lockup for conspiracy to commit murder instead of under our protection tell us everything you know so we can get him before he gets you why would he wanna kill me i aint do nothing who knows with this guy from what he said it may have to do with him tying up loose ends regarding poisoning some kid named brock or maybe its because you know where his money is i dont know where his money is that aint what we heard you aint listening to the people in the know me and kuby rented a van for the dude loaded his cash up in a selfstorage unit handed over the keys to him at goodmans who knows where he took it from there a van

ros√£ for us its always been science first and wait would you would you would you go back please  shamwows  more of a byproduct there exactly what this yes butjust yesterday your charity the gretchen and elliott schwartz foundation announced a  million grant for drugabuse treatment centers throughout the southwest charlie the southwest is our home and we couldntjust ignore whats going on in our own backyard but im sure youre aware that there are people who suggest other motives andrew ross sorkin of the new york times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to shore up the stock price of gray matter technologies because of your association with walter white thats not exactly the way to cleanse yourselves so to speak of having a methamphetamine kingpin as cofounder of your company charlie im glad you brought that up i have to believe that the investing public understands were talking about a person who was there early on but who had nothing to do with the creation of the company and still less to do with growing it so what was walter whites contribution you know to be honest honey the company name the company name we came up with it by combining our names schwartz means black black plus white makes gray hence gray matter technologies exactly as far as i can recall his contribution begins and ends there there are continuing reports of blue methamphetamine considered his signature product throughout the southwest and some evidence of reaching as far as europe so my question is is walter white still out there no hes not you sound very sure i am i cant speak to this heisenberg that people refer to but whatever he became the sweet kind brilliant man that we once knew long ago hes gone but to be absolutely clear police hands show us your hands show us your hands whats going on lets see your hands  just get me home just get me home ill do the rest √¢¬™ i saddled up and away i did go √¢¬™ √¢¬™ riding alone in the dark √¢¬™ √¢¬™ maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me √¢¬™ √¢¬™ tonight nothings worse than this pain in my heart √¢¬™ √¢¬™ and at last here i am on the hill of the √¢¬™√¢¬™ yes hello this is david linn from the new york times may i speak with susan please thank you hi susan its david again i was just calling to see if we can set well yes well i figured wed have to do the interview by phone since theyve already

contact with my photographer to check on his schedule no no its their call i know how busy mr and mrs schwartz are thank you this should make one hell of a story goodbye im just saying its apples and oranges listen i maintain if i want pizza i go to a pizza place yeah if i want thai i go to a thai place what is the point in comparing did i marry you pizza to thai what has happened  this is different  theyre completely oh come on are you the man i married i am the guy who wants to end this ridiculous conversation kick off my shoes and have a very large glass of wine well im gonna tell you to be my guest all right wait the answer is  no yes yes because it has history come on prohibition the sweet smell of success and per se has thomas keller game set and match the whole vibe is so yountville you transplant it to manhattan transplant it to islamabad i would eat there oh theres a good thought what islamabad no napa we have to go to napa oh my god all this talk of food do you think juana left us anything  she doesnt think were coming back until wednesday unless you told her no i havent talked to her oh look here just a pear thatll be perfect yeah you wanna get us a nice bottle of wine mmhm do you think we have any of those what are those crackers with like the sundried tomato and they were slightly peppery but not too peppery  we dont have them  no ask juana we havent had them in forever i dont know why she doesnt get those why dont you talk to her shes got that thing with her daughter anyway napa yeah how long since weve been two years jesus thats two years yeah too long right is this okay oh that looks p e r fe c to you wanna get the fireplace is it good mmhm is it ripe mmhm yeah we could invite george and delores they could come up from marin and bill and miriam cohen we could have a little spa action right and then we could do some sort of wine and then hello gretchen elliott i really like your new house walt this are we looking east oh my god you must have one great view of the sangre de cristos walt what are you doing here i saw you on charlie rose you looked great you both did if you are here to to hurt us walt whatever it is youre planning actually im here to give you something its out in my car how about the three of us take a walk to it its just parked down the road i couldnt get it past your gate elliott if were gonna go that way youll need a bigger knife keep stacking itll all fit thats all right yeah just throw it on top gretchen would you mind we dont want to lose any under the furniture all right that is  where did it come from and why is it here i earned it and youre going to give it to my children what why walt i dont think we on my sons th birthday which is  months and two days from today you will give him this money in the form of an irrevocable trust you will tell him that it is his to do with as he sees fit but with the hope that he uses it for his college education and for the betterment of his family walt im not sure that we follow why i mean why in particular would we if you wanna give your kids drug money go do it yourself i cant my wife and son hate me they wont take my money even if they did the federal government wouldnt let them but two rich benefactors who are known for their charitable endeavors who would think nothing of for instance writing a  million check to help victims of methamphetamine abuse i have to think that your money would be very welcome it wouldnt make any sense coming from us it certainly would my children are blameless victims of their monstrous father a man who you once knew quite well call it a beau geste call it liberal guilt call it whatever you want but do it and you are not to spend a single dime of your own money if there are taxes or lawyers fees owed you will take it right from here they use my money never yours okay walt sure that sounds reasonable so what happens next i guess we shake on it and i leave i can trust you to do this yes absolutely you can dont move dont dont dare move a muscle you dont want them to think that youre trying to get away just breathe just this afternoon i had an extra  that i would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table instead i gave it to the two best hit men west of the mississippi now whatever happens to me tomorrow theyll still be out there keeping tabs and if for any reason that my children do not get this money a kind of countdown will begin maybe a day or so later maybe a week a year when youre going for a walk in santa fe or manhattan or prague wherever and youre talking about your stock prices without a worry in the world and then suddenly youll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you but before you can even turn around pop darkness cheer up beautiful people this is where you get to make it right oh yeah right you know i dont exactly know how to feel about all this for real yo whole thing felt kind of shady you know like moralitywise totally how do you feel now

good news for breathing is thatthree patches its a threepatch problem well you asked me to come oh yeah of course my phone always a chance that my number will be mrs hudsons got a phone shes downstairs  i wasthe other side of london here so whats this about  the case  her case her suitcase yes obviously the murderer took her suitcase ok he took her case so its no use theres no other way on my desk theres a number youve brought me here text yes the number on my desk  whats wrong  a friend oh which one well your archenemy according to him did he offer you money to spy on me  yes  no  think it through next time the most dangerous man youve ever met on my desk the number jennifer wilson that was hang on wasnt that the dead woman yes thats not important  are you doing it  have you done it these words exactly what happened at lauriston gardens i must have blacked out  northumberland street  you blacked out type and send it quickly  have you sent it  northumberland street hurry up thats thats the pink ladys case yes obviously oh perhaps i should mention   i never said you did given that text and the fact i have her do people usually assume now and then yes ok  how did you get this where the killer must have driven her he could only keep her case by accident nobody could be seen with this case particularly a man so obviously hed feel compelled wouldnt have taken him more than i checked every backstreet five minutes from lauriston gardens and anywhere you could dispose of took me less than an hour pink you got all that because  it had to be pink obviously because youre an idiot no no dont look like that now look do you see whats missing from the case how could i her phone wheres her mobile phone there was no phone on the body we know she had one maybe she left it at home she has a string of lovers she never leaves her phone at home er why did i just send that text well the question is  she could have lost it the murderer you think maybe sheleft it maybe he took it from her for some reason either way the balance of probability sorrywhat are we doing what good will that do phone rings a few hours after his last victim and now he receives a text if somebody had just found that phone theyd ignore a text like that would panic  have you talked to the police so why are you talking to me mrs hudson took my skull so im basically filling in relax youre doing fine  well wellyou could just sit there you want me to come with you i like company when i go out the skull just attracts attention so  problem what about her she said you get off on this and i

they painted want to well maybe he wasnt answering oh good you follow no what kind of a message what about this morning  those letters you were looking at yes he was being threatened mans voice in background not by the gas board dimmock see if we can get prints sergeant we havent met yeah i know who you are and i would prefer it if you didnt  i phoned lestrade is he on his way and its not sergeant were obviously looking at a suicide it does seem wrong its one possible explanation youve got a solution that you like to ignore anything you see  like  and requires quite a bit of contortion lefthanded im amazed you didnt notice all you coffee table on the lefthand side coffee mug handle pointing to the left power sockets habitually used on the left of the phone picked up with  dyou want me to go on i might as well theres a knife on the breadboard because he used it with his left that a lefthanded man would shoot himself conclusion someone broke in here only explanation of allof the facts  but the gun  hed been threatened today at the bank sort of a warning he fired a shot  and the bullet oh come on  what are the chances of that wait until you get the ballistics report the bullet in his brain wasnt fired but if his door was locked from good youre finally asking hes left trying to sort of which of course can never be done it was a threat im kind of in a meeting can you make an appointment i dont think this can wait one of your traders someone  what the police are at his flat  killed with everyones digestion would maybe harrow oxfordvery bright guy worked in asia for a while

holmes it happened last night journalist shot dead in his flat doors locked exactly the same as van coon god you think hes killed another one holmes brian lukis murdered in his flat doors locked from the inside watson youve got to admit its similar both men killed by someone inspector do you seriously believe just another city suicide sighs you have seen and the shot that killed him  no a bit quicker if you were ive just handed you a murder inquiry five minutes in his flat four floors up thats why they think theyre safe put a chain across the door they dont reckon for one second  i dont understand  what are you doing  clunk  what he climbed up the side of the walls dropped in through this skylight youre not serious like spiderman he scaled six floors of a docklands  jumped the balcony and killed van coon thats how he got into the bank  ran i have to find out date stamped on the book sherlock so the killer goes to the bank leaves a threatening cipher at the bank van coon panics returns hours later he dies the killer finds lukis at the library on the shelf where he knows late that night he dies too why did they die sherlock only the cipher can tell us the worlds run on codes and ciphers from the millionpound security system you took exception to cryptography yes ok but but its all computer generated  electronic codes this is different its an ancient device modern codebreaking methods  where are we headed what sorry you heard me perfectly  you need advice yes i need to talk to an expert siren wails part of a new exhibition  interesting urban bloodlust frenzy chuckles catchy ive got two minutes before comes around that corner can we do this while im working  know the author its like michiganhardcore propellant id say zinc and what about the symbols im not even sure two men have been murdered raz deciphering this is the key and this is all youve got to go on   its hardly much is it ill ask around  somebody must know something about it metallic clattering what the hell do you think youre doing no no wait wait i was just holding this for bit of an enthusiast are we police radio in background she was right in the middle of why would she suddenly resign family problems but she doesnt have a family  andy theyve become her obsession shes been working on restoring them i cant believe perhaps she was getting a bit of door slams youve been a while yeah well you know how it is custody sergeants dont really just formalities fingerprints charge sheet and ive got to be  what  theyre giving me an asbo you want to tell your little pal this symbol i still cant place it no i need you to go and ask about the journalist the personal get hold of his diary or something go and see van coons pa if you retrace their steps shutter clicks scotland yard flew back from dalian friday looks like he had backtoback meetings can you print me up a copy  sure  can you tell me where he was i have all his receipts  your friend im behind you   per cent hes an arrogant sod well that was mild this is what you wanted isnt it what kind of a boss was he amanda um no thats not a word id use the only things eddie appreciated like that hand cream look at this one got a taxi from him on the day he died that would get him to the office not rush hour check the time  as far as underground printed at one in piccadilly so he got a tube back to the office why would he get a taxi into town because he was delivering you wouldnt lug a package delivering to somewhere near piccadilly station dropped the package stopped on his way he got peckish so you bought your lunch but where were you headed from where did the taxi drop you  oof eddie van coon brought a package here whatever was hidden inside that case ive managed to piece together a picture using scraps of information  credit card  then he came here somewhere in this street somewhere  that shop over there lukiss diary he was here too  he wrote down the address shop bell rings hello you wantlucky cat no thanks no √¢   √¢   i think your wife she will like um maybe sherlock  the label there its exactly the same as the cipher watson clears throat its an ancient number system  these days only street traders use it those were numbers written on the wall numbers written in watson its a   what we thought was the artists tag and the blindfold the horizontal line  the chinese number one john two men travel back from china both head straight for what did they see its not what they saw its what they both brought back and you dont mean duty free thank you think about what sebastian told us about van coon about  lost  million thats how he made such easy money he was a smuggler mm cover would have been perfect businessman lukis was the same both of them smuggled stuff about the lucky cat was their dropoff but why did they die it doesnt make sense if they both why would someone threaten them and kill them after the event after theyd finished the job what if one of them  how do you mean something from the hoard the killer doesnt know so threatens them both right remind me when was the last time that it rained its been here since monday noones been in that flat could have gone on holiday do you leave your windows open metallic screech sherlock  groans someone else has been here somebody else broke into the flat and  sniffs watson do you think maybe can you not keep doing this

pattern  yes look dont worry because the average human memory  well dont worry i remember all of it well at least i would if i could get to mobile beeps train rumbles always in pairs john look numbers

tomorrow at  apparently its going to save the world but give me a moment ive only been oh come on its not code these are seat allocations theres no letter i because no letters past k the numbers always appear but the letters have little runs families and couples sitting together only a jumbo is wide enough to which is why theres always an upstairs theres a row  which eliminates then theres the style that eliminates a few more and assuming the british point considering the original source and assuming from the increased that the crisis is imminent the only flight that matches all is the  to baltimore tomorrow please dont feel obliged to tell me johns expressed that thought in every possible variant i would have you right here on this desk until you john please can you check those yeah

mr holmes i dont think you do theres going to be a bomb the british and american but rather than expose theyre going to let it happen coventry all over again the wheel turns nothing is ever new well youre looking all better how are you feeling like putting a bullet sherlock scoffs theyd pin a medal on me if i did sir the coventry conundrum what do you think of my solution the flight of the dead plane blows up midair hundreds of casualties but nobody dies neat dont you think youve been stumbling around or were you too bored they wouldnt let us see shes not my real aunt we ran a similar project though i believe one of our passengers but thats the deceased for you late in every sense of the word how is the plane going to fly oh of course unmanned aircraft it doesnt fly it will never fly this entire project is cancelled the terrorist cells have been informed we cant fool them now weve lost everything one fragment of one email finished  your mod man one lonely naive man and a woman clever enough you should screen your defence people im not talking about the mod man a damsel in distress in the end are you really so obvious because this was textbook the promise of love the pain of loss then give him a puzzle  dont be absurd how quickly did you decipher was it the full minute or were you really eager to impress i think it was less than five seconds i drove you into her path im sorry i didnt know  mr holmes i think we need to talk there are a number of aspects not you junior youre done now theres more loads more on this phone ive got that could topple your whole world you have no idea how much and exactly one way to stop me unless you want to tell your is your own little brother we have people who can get into this i tested that theory for you i let sherlock holmes sherlock dear tell him what you found there are four additional units i suspect containing acid any attempt to open the casing explosive its more me take that risk you have a passcode to open this i deeply regret to say we have people sherlock there will be two passcodes one to open the phone even under duress you cant and there would be no point oh hes good isnt he in fact i might we destroy this then fine good idea unless there are lives of depending on the information are there telling you would be playing fair im not playing any more a list of my requests and some ideas about my protection id say it wouldnt blow much but then id be lying i imagine youd like to sleep on it  thank you yes  scoffs mycroft sighs youve been very thorough i wish our lot i cant take all the credit oh jim moriarty sends his love mycroft yes hes been in touch seems desperate for my attention i had all this stuff thank god for the consultant criminal gave me a lot of advice do you know what he calls you the ice man and the virgin didnt even ask for anything now thats my kind of man and here you are the dominatrix  nicely played sorry i said no very very close but no you got carried away the game was too elaborate theres no such thing as too much oh enjoying the thrill craving the distraction of the game but sentiment sentiment is a chemical defect sentiment what are you talking about  you look at the poor man you dont actually think why because youre the clever detective in the funny hat no whispering because i took your pulse elevated your pupils dilated i imagine john watson thinks but the chemistry is incredibly when we first met you told me how true of you your measurements but this this is your heart and you could have chosen any random number with everything youve worked for but you just couldnt resist it ive always assumed that love thank you for the final proof everything i said its not real  i was just playing the game and this is just losing there you are brother i hope the contents make up  i may have caused you tonight sherlock if youre feeling kind i doubt shell survive long  are you expecting me to beg please youre right i wont even last six months

people like him we know about them we watch them but james moriarty the most dangerous criminal mind and in his pockets the ultimate weapon a few lines of computer code and you abducted him to try and find the key code  interrogated him for weeks mycroft he wouldnt play along he just sat there the only thing that made him open up i could get him to talk just a little but in return you had to offer him so theres one big lie sherlocks a fraud but people will swallow it moriarty wanted sherlock destroyed and you have given him  clearing throat im sorry scoffs oh please tell him would you got your message the computer code is key to this beat moriarty at his own game  what do you mean use it to create a false identity so we can use it to break into and bring back jim moriarty again somewhere in

not this time even though youve behaved like sighing i wanted you not to be dead yeah well be careful if i hadnt come back  youd still have a future with mary look i find it difficult i know you were the best and the wisest yes of course i forgive you the criminal network its roots were everywhere like a mycroft fed moriarty moriarty in turn gave us hints just hints as to the extent of his web we let him go because it was important to let him and then i sat back and watched moriarty destroy my reputation bit by bit i had to make him utterly defeated me there were  likely scenarios each of them were rigorously it wasnt just my reputation that sherlock you can have me arrested you can torture me you can but nothings going to prevent your only three friends  unless and complete your story youve got to admit thats sexier sherlock but the one thing i didnt moriarty was prepared to go i suppose that was obvious given our his death wish gasps gunshot i knew i didnt have long i contacted and then everyone got to work sherlock on phone its a trick john all right stop it now sherlock now dont move john all right sherlock keep your eyes fixed on me please will you do this for me sherlock it was vital that john and that way his view was sherlock gasps i needed to hit the airbag speed was paramount the airbag needed to be got out of the but we needed him to see a body thats where molly came in like figures on a weather clock john went the other then our welltimed cyclist gasps put john briefly out of action giving me time to switch places the rest was just window dressing and one final touch a squash ball apply enough pressure and it let me come through please  its all right  its all right  its all right its all right everything was anticipated it worked perfectly molly molly hooper she was in on it yes you remember the little girl  screaming you assumed she reacted like but i deduced moriarty must have found to plant suspicion and that that man had to be got out of the way that meant there was a corpse that looked just like me clever molly found the body faked the records ive got lots of coats anderson what about sherlock mycrofts men intervened he was invited to reconsider is it done good and your homeless network as i explained the whole street was  neat dont you think  what oh really no im not saying what bit disappointed oh everyones a critic  anyway thats

course you are course youre my best friend well how was that surprisingly okay so youll have to make a speech sherlock clearing throat so done that done that done that bit done that bit done that bit im afraid john all emotions and in particular love stand opposed to the pure cold reason a wedding is in my considered opinion nothing short of a celebration of and irrational and sentimental in this ailing today we honour the deathwatch beetle and in time one feels certain but anyway lets talk about john please clearing throat if i burden myself with it is not out of sentiment or caprice it is that he has many that he has overlooked indeed any reputation i have comes in truth from john so selflessly provides it is a fact i believe exceptionally plain bridesmaids there is a certain and contrast is after all gods own plan to enhance or it would be if god were not designed to provide a career opportunity guests murmuring the point im trying to make the most unpleasant rude ignorant and allround obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have i am dismissive of the virtuous unaware of the beautiful and uncomprehending so if i didnt understand it is because i never expected to be and certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest i have ever had the good fortune woman aw john i am a ridiculous man redeemed only by the warmth but as i am apparently i cannot congratulate you actually now i can mary when i say you deserve this man it is the highest compliment john you have endured war and injury and tragic loss so sorry again about that last one so know this today you sit between the woman you have made your wife in short the two people who and i know i speak for mary as well and we have a lifetime ahead sobbing  if i try and hug him stop me ah yes

would he change his identity maybe hes married oh married obvious really our mayfly man was trying to escape and instead of endless nights or going to barbeques boring people he couldnt stand he used his wits cleverness to play the field he was on second thoughts i probably should have told you however it does help how invaluable john is to me i can read a crime scene i used to think quite frankly i still do should any of you require i will solve your murder but it takes john watson trust me on that i should know hes saved mine so many times this blog is the story of two men and their  guests chuckling but from now on theres a new story a bigger adventure ladies and gentlemen pray charge your glasses today begin the adventures and john hamish watson giggling the two reasons why every shutter clicking shutter clicking shutter clicking what did you say you said john hamish watson you said that you said hamish this is a famous detective and his partner john hamish watson how did you know how did you know his middle name never tells anyone he hates it john h watson yep  henry  humphrey shower running  higgins took him years to confide in me sighing thats my birth certificate yep and the woman she knew hamish clearing throat john hamish watson just if you were god knows where she is out of my head i am busy theres only one time john does it have to be its your name  its traditional tessa enjoy the wedding enjoy the wedding the wedding you knew about the wedding more importantly now barely a hundred people the mayfly man only saw five women for one person to be in both groups could be a coincidence mycroft oh sherlock what do we say about coincidence the universe is rarely so lazy so the balance of probability is someone went to great lengths to find out something  what great lengths  which suggests  also suggests clearly but more importantly the mayfly man the mayfly man is  here today ooh sorry i clearing throat waiter another glass sir thank you yes thank you yes something is going to happen now where were we could be any second you have control of the room ah yes raising glasses very good thank you dont lose it and down again guests muttering ladies and gentlemen people tell you get off early leave them laughing wise advice ill certainly part two part two is more actionbased im going to walk around whod go to a wedding who would bother to go to any lengths well everyone weddings are great love a wedding  whats he doing and johns great too i havent said that enough i could go on all night about  woman jumpers does a thing thing with peas once might not be peas might not be him but hes got a great singing voice too many too many too many too many sorry too many jokes about john now uh criminal intent where was i ah yes extraordinary lengths speech speech lets talk about all of which is suggestive of  murder sorry did i say murder but you know theyre quite similar procedures the participants tend to know each other in fairness janine what about this one more importantly his girlfriends and hasnt bothered to pick or point out the grease smudge currently hes going home alone theyre always tremendously grateful  gasps  the loos now please  the loos please  why yeah actually now you mention it john sherlock for this speech gotta cut the cake oh ladies and gentlemen cant stand it when i finally  vatican cameos battle stations someones going to die what narrow it down narrow it down narrow it down no no not you not you you its always you john watson you keep me right  what do i do dont solve the murder save the life inhaling sorry offpiste a bit back now phew lets play a game lets play murder mrs hudson sherlock imagine someones going to get who exactly would you pick i think youre a popular choice if someone could move mrs hudsons glass that would be lovely more importantly most people you can kill any old place as a mental exercise the murder of friends and colleagues now john id poison ive given him chemicals and compounds he missed a whole wednesday once lestrades so easy to kill its a miracle no ones ive got a pair of keys i could easily break in there if the whim arose hes pissed isnt he ow so once again clearly its a rare opportunity so its someone someone for whom known about months in advance has to be a unique opportunity and since killing someone killing them in private isnt an option someone who lives in an inaccessible someone private perhaps obsessed with personal security  beeping major james sholto who he  i dont think hes coming  where are you living these days way out in the middle of nowhere the press and the familys he gets more death threats than you oh a recluse small household staff  job high turnover for additional security i do security work probably all signed do you have a secret  all no however rather a big one a huge one how would you do it there has to be a way  this has been planned oh hello again archie get this right and theres the invisible man could do it the who the what the invisible man the one who tried to kill the guardsman bainbridge bainbridge oh not just planned ladies and gentlemen to the bride and groom guests to the bride and the groom major sholtos going to be murdered i dont know how or by whom excuse me coming through consulting  stay here excuse me coming through excuse me sorry one moment oh im so sorry whats happening whats going on how can you not remember which room  i have to delete something knocking major sholto major sholto major sholto if someones about it wont be the first time im ready major let

sorry sholto youre the famous mr holmes tell me how he did it please this is no time for games so are you so long as youre here please leave me despite my reputation i really  solve it solve it and hell open the door i couldnt solve it before  because it matters now whats she talking about john shes right  oh youve changed you are not a puzzle solver youre a drama queen now the game is on solve it clinking sizzling  shower running knocking bainbridge though in fairness  hes a drama queen too major sholto im afraid youve already been killed  what did you say my belt his belt yes bainbridge was stabbed  but it was through his belt tight belt worn high on the waist very easy to push a small blade and you wouldnt even feel it the belt would bind the flesh together  when it was tight  and when you took it off all the time in the world major sholto so i was to be killed by my uniform how appropriate he solved the case major a deal is a deal im not even supposed they gave me i couldnt imagine life i suppose given the circumstances when so many want you dead whatever youre doing in there james i will kick this door down sholto mr holmes yes i think we are theres a proper time to die of course there is and one should embrace it when it comes like a soldier of course one should we wouldnt do that we would never do that to john watson  im going to break it down hmm i believe i am in need i believe im your doctor classical waltz playing humming yeah pretty good just  hold your nerve when youre turning because we are about and your skills are appalling laughing  well youre a good

the camera what are you doing what is this jonathan small todays substitute known to us as the mayfly man his brother was one of the raw recruits johnny sought revenge on sholto worked his way through sholtos staff an invitation to a wedding the one time sholto would so he made his plan and rehearsed the murder making sure of every last detail brilliant ruthless though in fairness everything you needs on that you probably ought to  do you always carry handcuffs come on quick its not me you should oh i dont do the arresting sholto hes the killer not me i should have killed him quicker i shouldnt have tried to be clever you should have driven faster right violin playing gasps really both laughing whoo yeah whoo ladies and gentlemen before the evening begins properly apologies for

merchant i give in i am yours but tell me when you saw me this morning because said death i had an appointment with you tonight in samarra if this gets any better it pays to advertise so what about

prime minister  leader of the government female for gods sake why are you playing for time its the gap look at the gap everything else is perfectly ordered managed this whole things verging on ocd my respects this figurine is routinely and this pictures yet this ugly gap remains somethings missing from here  yes a plaster bust oh for gods sake it got broken what the hell has this  rug well how could it get broken and there is a big thick rug  does it matter it is worth letting him do this is your friend quite mad no hes an arsehole look no we had a breakin some little bastard smashed it to bits we found the remains the porch where we came in how anybody could theyd go to the trouble im no expert but possibly her face why didnt he smash all the others perfect opportunity and look at oh inspector  if theres nothing you do its quite simple but first tell me  this room was in darkness and the porch where it the motion sensor was damaged  so i assume its permanently lit i lack the arrogance to ignore details so youre saying he smashed it  where he could see it  why wouldnt it be fun if i knew mr holmes please it was your th birthday of course you were disappointed that your son hadnt made it back after all he was in tibet  yes no the first part in fact prerecorded video easily arranged its a skype call the trick was meant to be a surprise  trick could you take a photo and send it there were two types of vinyl one the actual passenger seat well good enough effectively a costume youre joking im not all he wanted was for you so he could spring the surprise oh my god surprise thats when it happened i cant be certain of course must have suffered you said hed felt unwell  you all right probably just the altitude he died there and then no one had any cause to go near his car so there he remained when the two cars the fake seat had whod been sitting there oh god poor kid really im so sorry mr welsborough mrs welsborough this is where it was smashed  that was amazing the car the kid ancient history whats so important about cant stand it never can theres a loose thread in the world doesnt mean you have to pull on it what kind of a life would that be  i have the strangest feeling thats mine you two take a bus why i need to concentrate  the mall please  i met her once rather arrogant i thought  you thought that why am i looking at this thats her john and marys baby oh i see yes looks very fullyfunctioning is that really the best you can do sorry ive never been babies humans moriarty did he have any connection any interest in her why on earth would he i dont know you tell me in the last year of his life james moriarty was involved with over  assorted robberies including a chemical weapons factory and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down which is still missing by the way in case you feel like applying yourself its a pearl get another one something important about this im sure maybe its moriarty maybe its not but somethings coming are you having a premonition the world is woven every strand crossing every other what we call premonition if you could attenuate the future would be entirely calculable as inevitable as mathematics appointment in samarra im sorry the merchant who cant outrun death you always hated that story as a child less keen on predestination back then im not sure i like it now you wrote your own version appointment in sumatra the merchant goes to a different city good night mycroft then he becomes a pirate keep me informed  of what ammo  ammo oh hi stella  greg yeah hes just got a client so right right right er so you see a lot of each other its nothing i mean its nothing serious no no i just pop around yeah of course i mean he loves a really tricky case yeah he does so what are you here for well interpol think the borgia pearl borgia pearl yeah so how did you two first meet oh it was a case about ten years ago there was an old lady oh yeah  how did she die  what but then i met sherlock would you please keep it down  sorry now you havent always been you started out in manual labor oh dont bother being astonished your right hands almost hard manual work does that oh i was a carpenter like my dad are you trying to give up and you once had a japanese girlfriend but now you feel indifferent about how the hell yes ecigarettes not just that if you just want to smoke indoors in one of those irritating but youre convinced you you dont want to buy a pipe because that means so instead always sure that each will be your last john  what is that well its a me substitute dont be so hard on yourself you know yeah its been there has it where were you helping mrs h with her sudoku  what about my girlfriend you said i had an ex youve got a japanese tattoo in the its obvious but surely that means not that im indifferent if shed really hurt your feelings you would have had the word obliterated but the first attempt wasnt successful so it seems you can live with this hence the indifference i thought youd done something clever oh no no but now youve explained it ive withheld this information but i think its time what do you mean have you ever wondered if your wife was  well im afraid its far worse than that  what her real name is greta bengsdotter swedish by birth and probably shes been operating deep under cover as your wife for one reason only  to get near the american embassy tomorrow the us president as part of an official state visit as the president greets greta bengsdotter will inject the president in the back of hidden inside a secret compartment this drug will then render to the will of that new master  none other than james moriarty moriarty will then use to destabilize the which is due to vote tipping the balance in favor this chain of events will then thus precipitating world war three are you serious no of course not his wife left him and he likes to wear her lingerie i dont  just the bras so whats this all about then  having fun  while i can  sherlock  but oh this had better be good oh i think youll like it that is the bust isnt it no its another one different owner different part of town you were right whats wrong  i am pleased this is my game face the game is on another two have been smashed one belonging to mr mohandes hassan identical busts yeah and this one to a dr barnicot god knows whod want to do yeah but some people have an idee fixe they obsess over no no good there were other images of margaret  margaret thatcher present at the first breakin why would a monomaniac  ooh blood quite a bit of it too was there any injury

had one well havent you even looked at it yet i glanced at it why because ill know the truth there were four of us  agents polite term alex gabriel me and ajay there was absolute trust between us the memory sticks guaranteed it we all had one each containing aliases we could never be betrayed to destroy the other  who employed you oh we were at the top and then it all ended there was a coup in georgia the british embassy in tbilisi lots of hostages get them out there was a change of plan  who from just another voice on the phone and a codeword  ammo like ammunition we went in something went really wrong that was six years ago feels like forever i was the only one that made it out no  what the same someone whos looking oh my god thats ajay thats him  what hes alive i dont believe it this is amazing i thought i was the only one i thought i was the only one where is he i need to see him now before you gave it to john yeah of course it was our insurance above all they mustnt fall so ajay survived as well and now hes looking with all of agras i dont know tbilisi was six years ago mary im sorry to tell you this sorry no no families fall out the memory stick youre the only other survivor and hes already killed well hes just trying to find me thats all that matters i heard it from his own mouth tell her shes a dead woman walking why would he want to kill me  he said you betrayed him well its what he believes i suppose i was always afraid that something in my past yes well hes a very tangible ghost god i just wanted a bit of peace no mary you do i made a vow remember to look after the three of you sherlock the dragon slayer stay close to me and i will theres something what is it i hoped i wouldnt have to do this what are you  mary oh no its all right its for the best believe me you just look after him im so sorry agra a city on the banks of the river yamuna in the northern state it is  kilometers what are you wikipedia  yes oh good i love an acronym all the best secret societies have them team of agents the best  but you know all of that one of them ajay is looking for mary indeed well thats news to me is it hes already killed looking agra always worked i thought that might include you  me or whatever government agra were very reliable then came the tbilisi incident they were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong and that was that  your initiative freelancers are too woolly too messy i dont like loose ends not on my watch there was something else a detail a codeword  ammo little enough could you do you dont have many favors left then im calling them all in and if you can find whos after her you think you can go on of course is that sentiment talking no its me difficult to tell told you i made a promise a vow all right ill see what i can do but remember this brother mine agents like mary they get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way not on my watch my darling i need to tell you this because pardon me can you hear a

really am a very busy man would you mind cutting to the chase youre very sure of yourself with good reason there was once a merchant in a famous market in baghdad i really have never liked this story im just like the merchant in the story i thought i could outrun the inevitable ive always been looking always expecting to see  death john let me introduce ammo you were ammo you were the person using agra as her private why did you betray us  why does anyone do anything selling secrets well it would be churlish to refuse worked very well for a few years i bought a nice cottage in cornwall but the ambassador in tbilisi found out i thought id had it then she was taken hostage in that coup i couldnt believe my luck that bought me a little time but then you found out very handy they were always such reliable killers what you didnt know mary also tipped off the hostagetakers lady smallwood gave the order but i sent another one with a nice little clue should anyone have an inquiring mind seemed to do the trick and you thought your troubles were over i was tired tired of the mess of it all i just wanted some peace some clarity the hostages were killed agra too or so i thought my secret was safe but apparently not just a little peace thats all you wanted too wasnt it a family home really i understand so just let me get out of here right let me just walk away ill vanish ill go forever  what do you say mary no okay london aquarium yes now i was never a field agent i always thought id be rather good well you handled  thanks what cant have been easy keeping your mouth shut than most of the people in the room i didnt do this out of jealousy no same old drudge day in day out never getting out there just back to your little flat  theyve taken up the pavement outside the post office there the local clay on your shoes  yes your little flat well on your salary and you spent all the money and what are you widowed or divorced wedding rings at least  years old and youve moved it to another finger that means youre but youre not still married i favor widowed  you share your life with two burmese and a tortoiseshell judging by the cat hairs a divorcees more likely a widow to fill the void  sherlock dont and theres clearly otherwise you wouldnt be spending that probably accounts the slight tremor in your hand the red wine stain so yes id say jealousy to prove how good you are to make up for well mrs norbury i must admit this is unexpected vivian norbury you outsmarted them all all except sherlock holmes theres no way out so it would seem you see right through me mr holmes its what i do maybe i can still surprise you now come on be sensible no i dont think so  surprise everythings fine its gonna be okay  get an ambulance its all right  mary oh mary mary stay with me

a member of the judiciary one of you sits on the board two of you work for me and one of you faith you are the people i need to hear me i have made millions for myself for millions of people ive never

american car  im sorry left hand drive no why do you ask not sure actually are you okay of course you dont own a car you dont need one no human contact no visitors okay how do you know that its all here isnt it look cost cutting is clearly a priority for you look at the size of your kitchen must be a bit annoying when i dont understand hang on a minute i was looking out  i dont know itll come back to me presumably you downsized and maybe when you ended your relationship  you cant know that there wasnt anything physical quite some time in fact there see its obvious you cant tell things like think i just did didnt i  how sort of happens like a reflex i cant stop it coat  i dont have a coat  who you talking to  so what do you think  my case go to the police theyre really complicated sort of stuff that ought to get a reaction please i have no one else to turn to yes but im very busy at the moment this cup of tea  code because you might prefer some coffee youre my last hope really thats bad luck isnt it whats bad luck stop talking it makes me ive always had bad luck  its congenital thats not rude congenital handbag stop wait your life is not your own off it off it sorry what what are you talking about  your skirt look at the hem of it im still catching up with my brain those markings do you see them you only get marks like that by in a car door so you werent driving i came in a taxi there is no taxi waiting thats what i checked when and youve got all the way to the door and not made any move you didnt even bring a coat in this rain now that might mean nothing except the angle of the scars you know under that sleeve you never saw them no i didnt so thank you i dont really need to check with selfharm do i  no i want to see your handbag why its too heavy you said i was your last hope with no plan on how youre getting home and a gun  chips youre suicidal trust me sherlock are you going out i think i remember the way oh youre in a state yeah well ive got  what friend oh come on im culverton smith and this election for gods sake i was talking im sorry mr holmes hes left his flat was it on fire even when im on the road you see the fold in the middle for the first few months folded inside a book must have been a tightly packed shelf going by the severity of the crease so obviously you were keeping living in the same house where privacy could not be assumed conclusion relationship not any more though theres a pin the past few months conclusion the paper has been exposed to steam and so it must have been lots of different spices youre suicidal yet youre still cooking to impress youre keen and kitchen and since any visitor could be expected i have to assume you dont have any youve isolated yourself  amazing i meant the chips hmm lets go for a walk you should answer it its mycroft might be about sherlock of course its about sherlock how did you know my kitchen was tiny the fading pattern on the paper but its enough to know kitchen notice boards by instinct we place them at eye level now look the suns only but the line is straight so that means but because the top section is unaffected we know the sunlight can only be if the sunlight when the sun was lower in the sky then the paper would be equally faded top to bottom but no it only makes it when the sun so im betting that you live now if steeply angled eye level on the wall opposite the window then what do we know about the room the rooms small  oh big brother is watching you we can keep tabs i was talking to the prime minister oh i see whats he doing why is he just wandering about like a fool she died mycroft hes probably still in shock everybody dies thats the one thing how can it still come you sound cross am i going to be taken i have i think apologised extensively you havent made it up to me and how am i supposed to do that  sex sex how did you know i wasnt getting any its all about the blood this one comes you can see the pen marks over it i think you discovered the pains stimulated your memory im no expert but i assume that an increasing number of scars that the relationship how do you know he didnt notice oh well cause he would would he wouldnt he  well

are we gonna walk all night its a long word  what is culverton smith all this charity work we must be careful not to burn our bridges do you know why im gonna take your case because of the one what impossible thing you said your life turned on one word yes the name of the person thats the impossible thing  just that right there names are not one word sherlock holmes faith smith santa claus

sherlocks blog its gone downhill a bit hasnt it its this way then oh my god i love your blog youre welcome right here he comes you all know sherlock holmes oh and dr watson of course mr holmes i was wondering maybe you could tell us  no yes absolutely yes the main feature of interest in is not the sensational aspects but rather the iron chain that reveals stepbystep the solution thats the only truly now i will share with you the facts and and in this very room you will all attempt to solve i think you slightly gave away the ending  there were five main suspects its more about how he did it  poison drearcliff house remember that one john  ten suspects  all of them guilty and what do you call that one john um something to do with murder at the zoo yeah i called it murder at the zoo or was it the case of the killer orangutan he should be wearing the hat the kids would love the hat  so any more questions  i dont think so  mr holmes how do you capture a serial killer same way you catch any other killer no no but most killers youre looking for a murderer um mr smith maybe this isnt nurse cornish  how long have you been with us now seven years okay serial killers choose surely that must make it more difficult some of them advertise do they really serial killing is an a signature in human destruction ultimately for full satisfaction additionally serial killers they tend to be social outcasts  educationally subnormal youre just talking about the ones you know but hello dummy now imagine if the queen wanted to kill all that power all that money sweet little government a whole country hmm we all love the queen dont we and i bet shed love you lot its all right everyone that sherlock holmes is not well of course not not her majesty money power fame some things make you untouchable god save the queen she could open a slaughterhouse and wed all probably pay the entrance fee no ones untouchable no one look at you all so gloomy cant you take a joke if the queen was a serial killer we have that kind of friendship a big round of applause  come on wonderful thank you so much for coming  where are we going now no lets go in here so youve had another one oh its just a

used at discrete intervals as to your mental condition why cant i remember her  this is a private matter this is family thats why he stays so there were three holmes kids what was the age gap seven years between myself and sherlock middle child explains a lot so did she have it too  have what the deduction thing  yes enlighten me  you realize im the smart one but eurus she was incandescent even then our abilities were i was remarkable but eurus was described as an then why dont i remember her you do remember her in a way every choice youve ever made the man you are today is your memory of eurus she was different from the beginning she knew things as if she were somehow aware of truths you look funny grown up  whats wrong the memories are disturbing what do you mean examples they found her with a knife once she seemed to be cutting herself mother and father were terrified but when i asked eurus i wanted to see how my muscles worked jesus so i asked her if she felt pain and she said which ones pain then what happened musgrave the ancestral home and sherlock played funny how come on you lot they werent real an architectural joke √¢¬™ who will find me √¢¬™ deep down below the old beech tree √¢¬™ help  the east winds blow √¢¬™ east winds blow √¢¬™  sixteen by six and under we go  youre starting to remember redbeard redbeard redbeard he was my dog eurus took redbeard and locked him up somewhere no one could find him redbeard and she refused to say where he was redbeard shed only repeat that song her little ritual  redbeard to tell us where he was she said the song is the answer but the song made no sense √¢¬™ brother what happened to redbeard we never found him but she started calling him so we made our assumptions sherlock was traumatized natural i suppose he was but after that he was different never spoke of it again in time he seemed to forget how could he forget no they took her away why you dont lock up a child quite so it was what happened she knows where he is we cant make her tell us after that our sister where oh some suitable place not suitable enough however  she died there she started another fire this is a lie yes it is also a kindness this is the story i told our parents and to account for the absence and no doubt to prevent that too of course the depth of euruss psychosis couldnt hope to be contained uncle rudi took care of things where is she mycroft theres a place called sherrinford its a secure and very secret installation whose sole purpose is to contain  the demons beneath the road this is where we trap them sherrinford is more than a prison it is a fortress from what is inside it heaven may be a fantasy but i can give you thats where our sister has been she hasnt left not for a single day whoever you both met √¢¬™ i that am

in a manger youre asking for trouble  you know what this place is of course so am i under arrest again you remain a person of interest but until you commit i regret at liberty  then why am i here ah how do you want me there is in this facility are of occasional use what for like really difficult sums she predicted the exact dates on the british mainland that sort of thing in return however she

tell me i already know its gonna be awesome im your christmas present so whats mine redbeard no how are you bit of a lump true that but you have your uses you see your sister  yes family is always

thats my wife oh god thats my wife im going to shoot the governors wife please no please help her in about a minute bang dead please dont do that well you can stop me  how you want to save the governors wife choose either dr watson oh oh god you can t do it sherlock if you do it it has to be your brother or your friend you have to do this eurus will kill her doesnt appear we have a choice right then countdown starting  how long the countdown is for me withholding the precise deadline more evenly where possible please give me an explicit verbal i cant always read them i cant do this cant its murder this is not murder this is saving my wife im particularly focused where strategising round appears to create i will not kill yes very good thank you killing my wife is what youre doing no okay fine john dr watson are you married  i was she died what would you give to get her back i mean if you could if it was possible what would you do to save her eurus will kill me please save my wife there will im afraid be regular prompts to create an atmosphere of urgency ticktock tick tick tick tick tick tick ticktock ticktock ticktock whats your name  david of course im bloody sure nearly there right do you want to pray or anything with eurus holmes in the world you are a good man so are you ill spend the rest of my life please  oh god i know that you are scared just do it be quick tick tick tick tick tick tick this is very good dr watson i should have fitted you  good bye david tack tock tock tock please i cant sorry i cant do it fine its all right stop no no stop im sorry  its all right remember me  no you all right interesting all right there you go and hes dead it really wasnt very interesting were wonderful thank you you see what you did dr watson specifically because you dont want blood  two people are dead instead of one yes sorry hang on  oh what advantage is it not in the end selfish to keep ones hands clean you didnt have to kill her the condition of her survival was that this is an experiment there will be rigor sherlock pick up the gun its your turn next remember what happened this time what if i dont want a gun oh the gun is intended as a mercy  for whom  how so would you really want to do it would waste valuable time probably just take it theres only one bullet left you will only need one but you will need it please go through theres a few tasks for you and a girl on a plane  treats you know a violin in exchange for shes very clever im beginning to think youre not come on now all aboard she must be redecorating is that allowed shes literally taken over the asylum we have more to worry about barely dry recent thats for our benefit as a motivator to your im now reconnecting you fasten your seat belts  are you still there hello were still here  can you hear us everythings gonna be all right i just need you to tell me where you are outside is it day or night night that certainly narrows it down what kind of a plane are you on i dont know  is it big or small lots of people on it lots and lots but theyre all asleep where did you take off from and the drivers asleep no i understand but where did you come from my nans and where are you going  home enough for now time to play a new game look on the table in front of you open the envelope if you want earn yourself some phone time  this is inhuman this is insane six months ago a man called evans he was shot from a distance now if the police had any brains all brothers nathan garrideb all these photos are uptodate pulled the trigger sherlock whats this  based on what please make use of your friend sherlock i want to see you interact with also you may have to choose what do you make of it am i being asked to prove my usefulness yes i should think you are i will not be manipulated like this fine john john yeah i think ive seen one of these id say s oldfashioned sight glasses glasses nathan wears glasses evans was shot from  metres kickback from a gun with this caliber would be massive no cuts no scarring not nathan then whos next well done dr watson do you have a suspicion no were not competing theres a plane so what were doing is actually today we have to be soldiers mycroft soldiers and that means your priorities do you credit no my priorities just got a woman killed now as i understand it sherlock to refine your reasoning so if you dont mind im going to apply some context oh dear god two of the garridebs so getting the third along once you bring in your verdict  and justice will be done  what will you do with them youll drop them into the sea sink or swim  theyre tied up please continue with your deductions im now focussing on the difference a specified consequence can make why should we bother what if were disinclined i have if you remember were getting through the clouds oh thats nice try to tell me more about the plane why wont my mummy wake up so its got to be one of the other two now howard howard is a lifelong drunk terrible gin blossoms on his red nose and terror notwithstanding theres no way he could have taken so that leaves us with alex indentations on the temple suggests frown line suggests a lifetime of peering hes shortsighted or he was his recent laser surgery  laser surgery hes made an effort thats very good excellent suddenly he sees himself now that hes dumped the specs even has a spray tan but hes clearly not used to his new that could be told by the state and the fact that theres hair so it is a superficial job then but he got his eyes fixed he pulled the trigger he killed evans are you ready to condemn the prisoner  sherlock we cant do this sherlock are you ready  alex condemn him condemn him in the knowledge of i condemn alex garrideb mind the gap congratulations you got the right one now go through the door you dropped the other two why  interesting does it really make a difference instead of the guilty lets see the train has left the station no that felt pretty much the same john dont let her distract you  distract me  one more minute on the phone frightened im really frightened its okay dont worry so i just need you to tell me just the sea i can see the sea  are there ships on it i can see lights in the distance  is it a city shes about to fly over a city  well have to talk her through it  hello are you still there getting the plane away from any  it has to crash in the sea well obviously dr watson no we can help her land it and if we fail she crashes into a city how many will die then how are we gonna get her to do that im afraid were going to have to is there really no one there have you really really checked everyone s asleep wont you help me were going to do everything that we can im scared im really scared  its all right i now back to the matter in hand coffin problem someone is about to die it will be as i understand it so many words unsaid etcetera etcetera etcetera etcetera yes yes yes and this i presume whose coffin sherlock please start your deductions i will apply some context in a moment well allowing for the entirely id say this coffin is intended  makes it more likely to be a woman a childs coffin would be more expensive this is in the lower price range best available in that bracket that was a lonely night on google this is a practical and informed choice balance of probability suggests that distant from her close relatives that much is suggested acquainted with the process of death but unsentimental about  also the lining of the coffin or we could just look only it isnt a name so its for somebody who loves somebody its for somebody who loves sherlock this is all about you everything here so who loves you im assuming its not a long list  irene adler look at the coffin unmarried practical about death alone  molly shes perfectly safe for the moment her flat is rigged to explode unless i hear the release code im calling her on your phone sherlock  make her say it obvious sherly  no oh one important restriction youre not allowed to mention in any way you may not at any point suggest if you do i will end this session ticktock ticktock whats she doing shes making tea yes but why isnt she answering her phone you never answer your phone yes but its me calling hi this is molly leave a message okay okay just one more time come on molly pick up just bloody pick up hello sherlock is this urgent because molly i just want you to do and not ask why oh god is this one of your stupid games no its not a game  but im not at the lab well quickly then sherlock what is it what do you want ticktock ticktock molly please without asking why what words i love you  leave me alone please no dont hang up calmly sherlock why you doing this to me please i swear softer sherlock molly this is for a case im not an experiment sherlock no i know youre not an experiment were friends but please just say those words for me please dont do this its very important i cant say why but i promise you it is i cant say that of course you can why cant you  you know why of course you do ticktock ticktock ticktock please just say it i can t  not to you because because its true because its true sherlock its always been true if its true just say it anyway  you bastard you say it go on  what say it like you mean it final  seconds i i love you i love you molly molly please i love you  sherlock however hard that was come on
